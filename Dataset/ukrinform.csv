"Russia to engage about 1,500 marines from Pacific Fleet",2022-03-13 08:56:00+02:00,"The relevant statement was made by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Facebook, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.  The eighteenth day of Ukraine‚Äôs heroic resistance to the Russian military invasion has started. The condition, positions and nature of defense actions are remaining mostly unchanged as of 06:00 a.m., March 13, 2022.  The enemy continues to use civilian infrastructure for military purposes. In violation of the requirements of international humanitarian law (IHL), it continues to deploy units and equipment at high-risk facilities, shell civilians, conduct illegal searches of personal belongings and searches of local residents and disguise themselves in civilian clothes and uniforms of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.  The moral and psychological condition of the enemy‚Äôs troops continues to deteriorate. The number of deserters and those refusing to carry out orders is growing.  According to the available information, a large number of Russian servicemen wounded in the course of hostilities on the territory of Ukraine are being treated in Belarusian health institutions. They are running out of blood supplies required for surgery. About two-thirds of Belarusian blood reserves are redirected to meet the needs of the Russian military. The campaign to collect blood among public sector employees and the civilian population has been launched.  Due to combat losses, the Russian Armed Forces are creating new subdivisions. In particular, the enemy‚Äôs command center is planning to engage about 1,500 marines of the 40th separate marine brigade (Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Pacific Fleet).  In cooperation with other defense forces, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are repelling enemy attacks decently. In particular, over the past day, they have destroyed two helicopters, two fighter jets (including one Su-34 aircraft) and two unmanned aerial vehicles.  mk "

Despite the plans of the Russian generals, their army is running out of manpower. And in order to somehow improve the situation, Russia resorted to a ""trick"" - it decided to involve 16,000 volunteer fighters from Syria, Libya and the Central African Republic in the war with Ukraine.  ""As they say, 'noble' soldiers have a 'noble' goal: participation in the 'liberation movement in the Donbas.' The goal of receiving a reward of $300 per month of war looks more realistic. What is even more realistic is that participation in the war is, in fact, the only chance for the population of these 'third world countries' to get to Europe.

"""You sign your sentence"": Zelensky appeals to those who cooperate with invaders",2022-03-13 02:33:00+02:00,"Zelensky said this in a televised video address, Ukrinform reports.      Wise people of a strong country!  The 17th day of the war is over. War for the right to be free. For the right to live on our land the way we, Ukrainians, want it. Not the way someone came up with for us. And against us. Against our nature. Against our character.  The Russian invaders cannot conquer us. They do not have such strength. They do not have such spirit. They are holding only on violence. Only on terror. Only on weapons, which they have a lot. But the invaders have no natural basis for normal life. So that people can feel happy and dream. They are organically incapable of making life normal! Wherever Russia has come to a foreign land, dreams are impossible.  Only a very hard struggle for survival.  As a result of the attack on our land, on Ukraine, the Russian leadership is actually turning its state into an analogue of the so-called ""DPR"" and ""LPR"". Into a large area isolated from the rest of the world. Where poverty will reign. Where everything will be determined only by violence. And where people will flee. In any manner they can and whoever can.  Look who is leaving Russia now. Who withdraws business. These are professionals who can be competitive at the global market. These are IT specialists who do not want to live in an area where there is no freedom. These are businessmen who feel that everything will be taken away from them at any moment. These are artists who know that creativity in a territory where human life is worthless is also worthless.  Russia loses its brains. Loses talent. Loses money.  But if this is happening to Russia, then what awaits the so-called ""DPR"" and ""LPR""? Their analogues? Solely complete degradation.  The invaders in the Kherson region are trying to repeat the notorious experience of the formation of pseudo-republics. Blackmail local leaders, put pressure on deputies. Look for someone to bribe. They‚Äôre trying to organize the so-called ""KPR"". Stillborn as ""DPR"" and ""LPR"". To organize some ""committees"" against the legitimate government on our land. And against the will of the people who go out to protest every day. And who want Ukraine. I am grateful to them.  I want to tell some figures who lacked the disgust to refuse to talk to the invaders... I want to say - if some of them were suddenly tempted by proposals from the invaders... You sign your sentence.  The sentence is to follow more than 12,000 invaders who failed to understand in time why Ukraine should not be encroached upon.  An emergency meeting of the Kherson Regional Council took place. 44 deputies decided that the Kherson region is Ukraine, and no pseudo-republics have a place there.  Ukraine will stand the test. We need time and strength to break the military machine that came to our land.  I will not underestimate the threat. And I will not exaggerate the achievements. We are honest people, not Russia's Ministry of Defense. Which lies to everyone - millions of its citizens and even the head of the Russian Federation. So I say frankly: we still need to hold on. We still have to fight. Every day and every night we must look for ways to cause maximum damage to the enemy. In all areas of defense. Near Zhytomyr and Kyiv, near Chernihiv and Sumy, near Kharkiv and Luhansk, near Donetsk and Mariupol, in the south of the country and on the diplomatic frontline.  Having such tactics and having self-confidence, we will regain what‚Äôs ours.  We will come to Melitopol and Henichesk. We will come wherever our land is. And let the invaders know. Let all the collaborators they find know. That Ukraine will not forgive them. Nobody. Nothing.  Ukraine will not forget. Ukraine will find and prosecute. Every single one. In any possible way.  By the way, all humanitarian corridors, which were agreed upon, worked. 12,729 people were evacuated. The humanitarian cargo for Mariupol is to arrive tomorrow afternoon. Due to the complexity of the route they had to spend the night in Berdyansk.  On every occasion, I constantly repeat to our friends and partners abroad that they should do more for Ukraine, for Ukrainians. Because it is not only for Ukraine. This is for everyone in Europe.  Evil that purposefully bombs peaceful cities... Evil that fires even at ambulances and blows up hospitals will not be able to stop at one country. If it has the strength to go further.  I said this at a very important rally in support of our people, which was organized in Europe. More than a hundred thousand people in the squares of Italy and other countries of the continent gathered for a rally in support of Ukraine and against Russian aggression.  Millions of people heard my appeal later thanks to broadcasts and recordings.  We now enjoy the greatest support in the history of Ukraine for our aspirations and our independence.  You can take a public opinion poll in any country and you will see that Ukraine is among the leaders of those who are sympathized with and supported.  And Russia is not just among enemies. It is even a bigger enemy, bigger evil than North Korea. That's what Americans think, for example. Ordinary people in all states. As well as ordinary people in all European countries.  And I am grateful to them for this extraordinary support. Grateful for understanding our struggle. Because we are united by one dream - to live freely on our land. And we have the right to what everyone has in the free world. To a safe sky, as well as to our own land.  Dear Ukrainians!  Our heroes!¬†  The world has always loved those who fight against evil.  It was our resistance, the courage of all our people that inspired the world. Millions of people in different countries. Who 17 days ago might not have felt what they all have in common. We all have. And now it's obvious. Peace. Freedom. And love for our children. The children we are fighting for. For them to have a future.  I signed two important decrees.

As of 24:00 on March 12, the enemy continued the offensive operation against Ukraine, taking measures to restore combat capability and regroup troops, as well as preparing for renewed offensive in the Polissia, Siversky, Slobozhansky, Donetsk, Tavriya and Southern Bug areas.  The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine noted that during the entire period of hostilities in Ukraine, the enemy received fierce resistance. They did not achieve the goal of the operation in any of the areas. The nature of the actions shows the military leadership of the Russian Federation is not certain in matters of strategic objectives and the ultimate goal of the ""special military operation.""  According to the statement, Russian troops suffered significant losses, slowed the pace of the offensive, and were stopped in many areas. Military and civilian infrastructure continues to be destroyed. In order to compensate for the losses, the invaders organized the training of additional forces for conducting hostilities on Ukrainian territory.  The enemy did not carry out offensive operations in the Volyn direction. The military leadership of Belarus strengthened the protection of the border with Ukraine. There is a high probability of direct participation of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus in the military operation against Ukraine. There is an air reconnaissance of objects on Ukrainian territory with the help of UAVs, probably from Belarusian territory.  No active offensive actions of the enemy were recorded in the Polissia direction. Measures are being taken to restore combat capability and regroup troops.

They do not abandon attempts to storm the city of Mariupol. Russian invaders are trying to prepare reserves and go on the offensive in Sievierodonetsk, Vuhledar and Zaporizhzhia. The enemy had little success in the Volnovakha direction, capturing the eastern outskirts of the town and trying to move on.  The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine notes that the enemy does not refuse attempts to attack Kryvyi Rih. ""They did not succeed. They are looking for weaknesses in the defense of Ukrainian defenders. In order to increase efforts, they involve the reserves of the Airborne Forces in the operation. In some areas, they are trying to keep the previously occupied positions,"" the statement reads. "

ICC Prosecutor opens formal investigation into situation of Ukraine,2022-03-12 22:47:00+02:00,"That‚Äôs according to a statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Ukrinform reports.  It is noted that the events of recent days, in particular, the unprovoked escalation of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, give reason to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC are being committed in Ukraine. Along with the situations in Crimea and Donbas, there are grounds to claim that the aggressor's troops continue to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity.  The Ministry said that, despite the fact that Ukraine is not a party to the Rome Statute, the state has recognized its ad hoc jurisdiction based on statements submitted earlier. Indeed, Ukraine has filed two applications with the International Criminal Court. The first one concerned the events that took place in Ukraine in the period from November 21, 2013, to February 22, 2014, and the second one concerned continued crimes committed in the period from February 20, 2014. The analysis of these two appeals gave the Prosecutor's Office all grounds to allege that war crimes and crimes against humanity are being committed.  ""Russia's top military and political leadership is bound to appear before the International Criminal Court and be held accountable for every crime committed. This will be the Nuremberg Trials of the 21st century,"" the Foreign Ministry said.  The war with Russian invaders has been going on in Ukraine since February 24. The United States, the European Union, and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia as an aggressor, whose international isolation is expanding by the day.

We need to pull our strength and patience together and keep fighting,"" she said.  According to Maliar, it is necessary to work through all options for further developments and realize that the enemy will not be able to occupy any Ukrainian territory. After all, there are no pro-Russian people left in Ukraine today.  The Deputy Defense Minister stressed that the enemy had initially planned to fully conquer Ukraine, including the capital, in a few days, a week at most. Their plan never materialized due to strong resistance on the part of the Armed Forces and because Ukraine had been preparing for all scenarios.  ""The enemy is currently forced to adjust operation plans. And this turning point was due to them being no longer able to pursue their initial plan. After all, it got too complicated as the Ukrainians are learning to fight the Russian enemy. However, they are also learning the tactics of Ukrainian defenders.  Time is on our side because the enemy is disoriented after failing to achieve its goal. But we should not relax. The enemy is regrouping troops, looking into achieving those goals as they haven‚Äôt abandoned them,"" said Malyar.  On February 24, Russian President Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops have been shelling and destroying key infrastructure, massively shelling and bombing residential areas.  Martial law was imposed in Ukraine and general mobilization was announced.
