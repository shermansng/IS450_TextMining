Who Killed Three Aid Workers for Doctors Without Borders in Ethiopia?,2022-03-18 03:46:09+00:00,"This story was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.As the fight intensified in northern Ethiopia in June last year, three aid workers from Doctors Without Borders jumped into their four-wheel drive and raced across the battle-scarred landscape, searching for casualties.Hours later they vanished. The aid workers stopped answering their satellite phone. A tracking device showed their vehicle making a sudden U-turn, then stopping. Colleagues frantically tried to locate them.The next day they were found dead, their bullet-riddled bodies sprawled on a dusty roadside near their burned-out vehicle: María Hernández, a 35-year-old Spaniard and conflict veteran, in a bloodstained white bib with the Doctors Without Borders logo; Yohannes Halefom, a 32-year-old Ethiopian medic, face down in the dirt; and their Ethiopian driver Tedros Gebremariam, 31, lying on the road about 300 yards away.Doctors Without Borders, widely known by its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières, immediately denounced the killings as “brutal murder” but did not identify any culprit. Now, one is coming into view.  Investigators, senior aid officials and Ethiopian soldiers interviewed by the Times said the three aid workers were gunned down by retreating Ethiopian government troops on the orders of a commander who was infuriated to find them in an active combat zone.“He said, ‘Finish them off’,” said Capt. Yetneberk Tesfaye of the Ethiopian National Defense Force, who said he heard the command over the radio.  The aid workers had their hands over their heads when they were shot, according to another soldier who witnessed the killings.The brutal slaying in the northern region of Tigray, where a feud between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the leaders of the northern region of Tigray erupted into war in November 2020, attracted relatively little attention. It was yet another senseless atrocity in a bitter conflict that has been accompanied by reports of massacres, sexual assault, ethnic cleansing and other likely war crimes.  The atrocities are not just in Tigray. A gruesome video that circulated recently showed Ethiopian security forces burning alive three men, believed to be ethnic Tigrayans, in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz. The Ethiopian government pledged to bring the perpetrators to justice.But the killing of the three Doctors Without Borders employees underscored the specific perils facing aid workers in Ethiopia, where hunger and dislocation threaten millions even as the government seems to treat aid groups as enemies rather than allies.Since last July, when Tigray fell into rebel control, respected aid groups have been accused of running guns to rebels, senior United Nations officials have been expelled from Ethiopia, and the government imposed a punishing blockade on the region that has cut off food supplies to five million needy people, the U.N. says.Ethiopia is the world’s deadliest country for aid workers, with 19 deaths in 2021, more than in Afghanistan, Syria or Congo, according to The Aid Worker Security Database, a compilation of data on attacks. Local employees bear the greatest risk: of the 129 aid workers who died around the world last year, only three were international staff, including Ms. Hernández.Immediately after the Doctors Without Borders team was killed, the Ethiopian government blamed their deaths on Tigrayan rebels. The offices of Ethiopia’s prime minister, attorney general and military spokesman did not respond to questions for this article.The mission comes firstWhen the team from Doctors Without Borders set out on June 24 from their base in Abiy Adiy, in central Tigray, the war had taken a dramatic turn.Two days earlier, the Ethiopian military had abandoned Abiy Adiy in the face of a sweeping Tigrayan offensive. Huge battles were erupting across the region, with significant Ethiopian losses. Tigrayan forces were pressing toward the regional capital, Mekelle.  The Doctors Without Borders team, though, was committed to its mission.Ms. Hernández, raised in a tiny Spanish village, found her calling in her early 20s while volunteering in India at a shelter for underprivileged children. “There wasn’t a single day that I didn’t go to bed without a feeling of peace and joy,” she later wrote to her family.  In 2015, she joined Doctors Without Borders, which deployed her to some of the world’s toughest conflict zones: Yemen, Mexico, South Sudan, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. Ms. Hernández frequently returned to Madrid exhausted, and worried about finding the time to start a family, said Anne-Sophie Colleaux, a friend from Paris. But work came first.“For her, it was more important to do what she was doing,” said Ms. Colleaux.Mr. Yohannes, an easygoing medic with a quick smile, had joined Doctors Without Borders two months earlier, following a stint as medical director at a nearby hospital. He was equally dedicated to his work, his sister, Wezef Halefom, said in an interview.Their driver, Mr. Tedros, ran a small taxi business in Tigray before snagging a coveted job with an international relief agency. His wife had just given birth to their second child, a girl. They hadn’t settled on a name.The team drove south from Abiy Adiy, passing scattered bullet casings and shellfire craters from recent fighting, said a humanitarian investigator who asked not to be named to avoid reprisals against her organization. They found casualties — six wounded Tigrayan fighters and one civilian — who were dispatched to a hospital by ambulance. The team pressed on.  Just after 3 p.m., about a mile before the village of Sheweate Hugum, their Land Cruiser came up behind an Ethiopian military convoy traveling in the same direction, according to six Ethiopian National Defense Force soldiers who were in the immediate area, and were interviewed later for this story.  A spotter on the convoy reported the aid vehicle to their commander, Col. Tadesse Bekele, of the Ethiopian military’s 31st Division, according to other soldiers who were listening to the radio channel. Colonel Tadesse ordered them to fire on the vehicle.  Bullets thudded into the Land Cruiser, causing the three aid workers to jump out and take cover on the roadside, the soldiers said. A tracking device later recovered by investigators showed that it made a U-turn at 3:11 p.m., then stopped.Colonel Tadesse ordered his troops to apprehend the aid workers and search their vehicle. But when Ms. Hernández and Mr. Yohannes began to walk in his direction, hands raised, Colonel Tadesse yelled into his radio again.“He asked the soldiers why they were bringing the aid workers to him,” said Captain Yetneberk. “Then he ordered them to finish them off.”Capt. Girmay Moges, positioned about 50 meters from the aid workers, said he witnessed what happened next. “Three or four soldiers killed them,” he said.  The six soldiers spoke at the main prison in Mekelle, where they were held among thousands of Ethiopian troops imprisoned since Tigray fighters captured them in June. The Times interviewed them separately, and saw no sign that they had been coerced or coached by their captors.The soldiers said they knew that the incident reflected badly on Ethiopia’s military, but agreed to speak out because they believed that it was wrong. Maj. Teshome Abera hoped someone would eventually be held to account. “The soldiers would not have taken this action if they had not been ordered to do so,” he said.But accountability is rare in Ethiopia’s war. The government has charged just 60 soldiers with war-related abuses since November 2020 and convicted 16. The Tigrayan rebels, accused of similar crimes, have not charged anyone.Understand the War in EthiopiaCard 1 of 6An enduring conflict. On Nov. 4, 2020, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed began a military campaign in the country’s northern Tigray region, hoping to vanquish the Tigray People’s Liberation Front — his most troublesome political foe.Rebels turned the tide. Despite Mr. Abiy’s promise of a swift campaign, the Ethiopian military suffered a major defeat in June when it was forced to withdraw from Tigray. The fighting subsequently moved south.Tigrayan forces close in. In late October, Tigrayan rebels captured two towns near Addis Ababa, the nation’s capital. The government declared a state of emergency and called on citizens to arm themselves.Drones tip the balance. A string of victories at the end of 2021 signaled that the Ethiopian government was regaining its footing on the battlefield. A fleet of combat drones acquired from allies in the Persian Gulf region was a decisive factor in the reversal.Atrocities on both sides. A United Nations report in November offered evidence that all sides involved in the conflict had committed atrocities. Since the start of the war, the Ethiopian and Tigrayan forces have since been accused of carrying out transgressions including extrajudicial killings.A truce. On March 24, Ethiopia’s government announced what it called a “humanitarian truce” with the rebel forces, saying it was acting because thousands of people from Tigray, where food aid has not been delivered since December, had begun flooding into bordering regions seeking help.Video and photographic evidence from the immediate aftermath of the killings, reviewed by the Times, showed the bodies of the slain aid workers and their incinerated Land Cruiser. Soldiers said the vehicle had been deliberately destroyed with a rocket-propelled grenade.  The Ethiopian convoy continued south, to a town called Yechila, where it was ambushed by Tigrayan fighters. Several thousand Ethiopian soldiers were captured.Colonel Tadesse died on the battlefield, several soldiers said. The Times was unable to confirm his death.  A baby finally gets a nameVillagers lined the road as a United Nations-led convoy transported the bodies of the slain aid workers to Mekelle. Some villagers were dressed in traditional white garb, usually reserved for religious ceremonies, in a mark of honor.But in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s government began to treat international aid workers as foes.In July, Redwan Hussein, a minister with responsibility for Tigray, accused aid groups of supplying weapons to the Tigrayan rebels. Soon after, the government suspended the operations of the Dutch section of Doctors Without Borders, and the Norwegian Refugee Council, then expelled seven senior U.N. officials it accused of “meddling” in Ethiopia’s internal affairs. By then, Tigrayan forces were sweeping south toward the capital, Addis Ababa.But then the war changed direction again when Mr. Abiy, aided by armed drones supplied by Middle Eastern allies, forced the Tigrayans to retreat into Tigray. Now the conflict is concentrated in neighboring Afar region, where hospitals are filled with badly injured children.In Tigray, the humanitarian crisis is worsening. A government-imposed blockade means that just 8 percent of required food aid has reached Tigray since October, the U.N. says, putting 23,000 “severely wasted children” at risk of imminent death.Doctors Without Borders no longer operates in Tigray, although it continues to work in other regions of Ethiopia. Its employees have been “regularly subjected to harassment, serious threats and detentions,” Paula Gil, head of the organization’s Spanish branch, said in an email.The aid group said it had shared the findings of its internal investigation into the deaths of the three aid workers with the Ethiopian government.  But the tragedy has also raised questions about the Doctors Without Borders’ security procedures. Although its frontline ethos often places its staff in greater danger than many other aid groups, several aid workers said in interviews that the organization may have taken too many risks in Tigray.On May 25, a month before the killings, the aid group Action Against Hunger pulled its staff out of Abiy Adiy after some of its workers were detained, interrogated and beaten by Eritrean soldiers, an official with that organization said.The Eritreans, who were fighting alongside the Ethiopian military in support of Mr. Abiy, “assumed they were spies,” a security official with Action Against Hunger said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.Ms. Gil of Doctors Without Borders insisted that its team in Abiy Adiy had followed “strict and rigorous security management protocols.”Ms. Hernández was buried at a cemetery in Sanchotello, 110 miles from Madrid, alongside the grandparents who helped to raise her. A photo on the tomb shows a smiling young woman, looking out over the Spanish coast.Mr. Yohannes and the driver, Mr. Tedros, were buried near their homes in Tigray. Mr. Tedros’s wife decided on a name for their newborn daughter.She called her Maria.  A reporter employed by The New York Times contributed from Mekelle, Ethiopia.   "
"As Russia Digs In, What’s the Risk of Nuclear War? ‘It’s Not Zero.’",2022-03-22 21:27:41.266000+00:00,"A major war raging on Russia’s and NATO’s borders. Increasingly bold Western military support. Russian threats of direct retaliation. A mood of siege and desperation in the Kremlin. Growing uncertainty around each side’s red lines.As Russia and NATO escalate their standoff over Ukraine, nuclear strategists and former U.S. officials warn that there is a remote but growing risk of an unintended slide into direct conflict — even, in some scenarios, a nuclear exchange.“The prospect of nuclear conflict,” António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, warned this week, “is now back within the realm of possibility.”Leaders on both sides emphasize that they consider such a war unthinkable, even as they make preparations and issue declarations for how they might carry it out. But the fear, experts stress, is not a deliberate escalation to war, but a misunderstanding or a provocation gone too far that, as each side scrambles to respond, spirals out of control.  The war in Ukraine heightens these risks to a level not seen since the Cuban Missile Crisis, and in some ways is potentially more dangerous than that, some experts say.NATO forces, intended as defensive, are massing near Russian borders that, with much of Russia’s military bogged down in Ukraine, are unusually vulnerable. Increasingly paranoid Kremlin leaders, faced with economic devastation and domestic unrest, may believe that a Western plot to remove them is already underway.Russia has said that it considers the weapons and other increased military aid that Western governments are sending to Ukraine tantamount to war, and has implied that it might strike NATO convoys. Over the weekend, Russian missiles struck a Ukrainian base mere miles from Polish territory.  “Those are the things that make me really concerned about escalation here,” said Ulrich Kühn, a nuclear strategist at the University of Hamburg in Germany.  “The chance for nuclear weapons employment is extremely low. But it’s not zero. It’s real, and it might even increase,” he said. “Those things could happen.”The Kremlin has turned to nuclear saber-rattling that may not be entirely empty of threat. Russian war planners, obsessed with fears of NATO invasion, have implied in recent policy documents and war games that they may believe that Russia could turn back such a force through a single nuclear strike — a gambit that Soviet-era leaders rejected as unthinkable. The outcome of such a strike would be impossible to predict. A recent Princeton University simulation, projecting out each side’s war plans and other indicators, estimated that it would be likely to trigger a tit-for-tat exchange that, in escalating to strategic weapons like intercontinental missiles, could kill 34 million people within a few hours.Alexander Vershbow, NATO’s deputy secretary general from 2012 to 2016, said that Western leaders had concluded that Russian plans to use nuclear weapons in a major crisis were sincere, raising the risk from any accident or misstep that the Kremlin mistook for war.With Russian forces struggling in a Ukraine conflict that Moscow’s leaders have portrayed as existential, Mr. Vershbow added, “That risk has definitely grown in the last two and a half weeks.”Murky Red LinesSince at least 2014, when Russia’s annexation of Crimea led to high tension with the West, Moscow has articulated a policy of potentially using nuclear weapons against any threat to “the existence of the state itself.”Russian statements have subsequently expanded on this in ways that may make the country’s nuclear tripwires easier to inadvertently cross.  In 2017, Moscow published an ambiguously worded doctrine that said it could, in a major conflict, conduct a “demonstration of readiness and determination to employ nonstrategic nuclear weapons,” which some analysts believe could describe a single nuclear launch.Evgeny Buzhinsky, a retired member of the Russian military’s general staff, has described the aim of such a strike as “to show intention, as a de-escalating factor.” Some versions call for the blast to hit empty territory, others to strike enemy troops.The next year, Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president, said that Russia could use nuclear warheads “within seconds” of an attack onto Russian territory — raising fears that a border skirmish or other incident could, if mistaken as something more, set off a nuclear strike.  A 2020 Russian government paper seemed to expand these conditions further, mentioning the use of drones and other equipment as potentially triggering Russia’s nuclear red lines.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 30, 2022, 2:52 a.m. ETPutin’s war complicates India’s middle path among the global powers.Here are the latest developments from Ukraine.Four E.U. countries expel dozens of Russian diplomats suspected of espionage.These policies are designed to address a problem that Soviet leaders never faced: a belief that, unlike during the Cold War, NATO would quickly and decisively win a conventional war against Russia.The result is a reluctant but seemingly real embrace of limited nuclear conflict as manageable, even winnable. Russia is thought to have stockpiled at least 1,000 small, “nonstrategic” warheads in preparation, as well as hypersonic missiles that would zip them across Europe before the West could respond.  But Russian military strategists continue to debate how to calibrate such a strike so as to force back NATO without triggering a wider war, underscoring concerns that threading such a needle may be impossible — and that Moscow could try anyway.Escalation Risks“The escalation dynamics of a conflict between the U.S. and Russia could easily spiral into a nuclear exchange,” said Dmitry Gorenburg, an analyst of Russian military policy.Partly this is because, unlike Cold War proxy battles, Ukraine’s war is raging in the heart of Europe, with NATO and Russian forces massed a relatively short drive away from Moscow and several Western capitals.Partly it is because of Russia’s lowered nuclear threshold and heightened sense of vulnerability.But Moscow also seemingly believes that a sort of NATO-Russia conflict has already begun.Russian strategic doctrine is designed in part around a fear that the West will foment economic and political unrest within Russia as prelude to an invasion.With Mr. Putin now facing economic devastation and rising protests, “A lot of the pieces of their nightmare are already coming together,” said Samuel Charap, who studies Russian foreign policy at the RAND Corporation.  In these circumstances, Moscow could misconstrue NATO’s troop buildup, or steps of military support for Ukraine, as preparations for just the sort of attack that Russian nuclear policy is designed to meet.  “Between volunteers from NATO countries, all this NATO weaponry, reinforcement of Poland and Romania,” Mr. Charap said, “they might connect dots that we didn’t intend to be connected and decide they need to pre-empt.”In such a climate, a few mishaps or miscalculations — say, an errant strike or clumsy provocation by one side that sets off a stronger-than-expected retaliation by the other — could escalate, in only a few steps, to the point of triggering Moscow’s fears of an attack.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.Mr. Putin has already said that direct Western intervention in the Ukraine war might trigger Russian nuclear retaliation. Now, each uptick in Western support for Ukrainian forces tests those limits.“Part of our problem is that I’m not sure we have a clear sense of exactly where the lines are,” Dr. Gorenburg said, adding, “This is why we’re seeing all the hemming and hawing back and forth with the question of providing aircraft. There’s just uncertainty as to how the Russians would take that.”Dr. Kühn, the German analyst, worried that American domestic politics could play a role as well. Should Russia use chemical weapons or commit some other transgression, American leaders could face overwhelming pressure to retaliate beyond what Moscow anticipates.Many in Washington are already calling for a no-fly zone or other direct intervention, arguing that U.S. warheads would deter Moscow from nuclear retaliation.  But clearing Ukraine’s airspace would likely require striking air bases and anti-air defenses within Russia that also serve to defend Russia’s borders. Analysts caution that such fighting could easily spiral out of control or trigger the Kremlin’s fears of a NATO push to Moscow, leading Mr. Putin to launch a last-resort nuclear strike.War GamesChristopher S. Chivvis, a former U.S. intelligence official for Europe, recently wrote that “scores of war games carried out by the United States and its allies” all projected that Mr. Putin would launch a single nuclear strike if he faced limited fighting with NATO or major setbacks in Ukraine that he blamed on the West.The truth is that even Mr. Putin may not know his nuclear red lines for sure. But American fears of Russian nuclear escalation may be dangerous, too.Any nuclear conflict, however initially limited, carries an escalatory risk that strategists call “use it or lose it.”Both sides know that rapid nuclear strikes could wipe out their military forces in Europe, even their entire nuclear arsenals, leaving them defenseless.This means that both sides face an incentive to launch widely before the other can do so first — even if leaders believe that the conflict may have begun in error.  Recent advances in short-range missile technology means that leaders now have as little as a few minutes to decide whether or not to launch, drastically increasing the pressure to launch quickly, widely and with only partial information from the ground.Late in the Obama administration, two American war simulations imagined an accidental skirmish between NATO and Russia that Moscow met with a single nuclear strike.In the first, Pentagon leaders proposed a retaliatory nuclear strike to signal resolve. But a civilian White House official, Colin H. Kahl, instead persuaded them to stand down and isolate Moscow diplomatically. Mr. Kahl is now an under secretary at the Pentagon.But the second simulation ended with American nuclear strikes, underscoring that Washington cannot fully anticipate even its own actions in the event of such a crisis.

Is This the World’s Largest Potato?,2022-03-18 01:02:06+00:00,"In August last year, while weeding a patch of garden behind their home in New Zealand, Colin and Donna Craig-Brown struck gold, or what seemed like the world’s largest potato.“I had a big hoe in my hand, and it went, ‘clonk,’” said Mr. Craig-Brown, speaking by phone on Thursday from his farm near Hamilton, where a cow could be heard in the background. “I said to my wife, ‘What the hell’s that?’”Then, he said: “I got a great big four-pronged garden fork and laid into it, like an over-excited Viking warrior. I thrust my foot deep into the earth, dragged this thing out, kicking and screaming. It was the size of a rubbish bin lid.”They called it Doug.Doug, spelled Dug in some news reports, was as bronze and as burly as any Thanksgiving turkey and weighed 17.4 pounds. It came seemingly out of nowhere, and to Mr. and Ms. Craig-Brown, it looked, tasted and felt very much like a big potato. (They cut off and ate a small piece of it — raw.)  The discovery made its way into the news media, and with subsequent weigh-ins, excitement grew. After friends and family suggested the protuberance might be a contender for the Guinness World Records, the couple submitted an application for “the world’s heaviest potato,” sat back and waited.All over the world, people have grown, proudly displayed and sometimes won prizes for their giant pumpkins, potatoes and tomatoes. In February, a farmer in Israel was confirmed to have grown the world’s heaviest strawberry, according to Guinness: 289 grams (10.19 ounces). For some, it’s a hobby; for others, an obsession with the promise of a world record, fleeting fame and perhaps a few chuckles. For the Craig-Browns, it was an accident.Mr. Craig-Brown, 62, is the son of a horticultural scientist. He and his wife, Donna, 60, ran a small farm. The couple had not previously grown potatoes, meaning Doug would have had to have been self-seeded. At 17.4 pounds, it was substantially larger than the world’s heaviest known potato, which weighed in at 11 pounds and was unearthed in 2010 by Peter Glazebrook, a seasoned grower of massive vegetables in Britain.As the couple waited for word from Guinness, doubts began to creep in elsewhere. To some in the trade, the photos of Doug suggested that, while impressive, it wasn’t quite a potato.  Then, an email from Guinness landed in Mr. Craig-Brown’s inbox last week. A slice of the growth had been submitted for DNA testing, and the results confirmed the doubters’ suspicions: Doug was not a potato at all.ImageColin Craig-Brown holding Doug in August. It looked, tasted and felt  like a big potato, he said.Credit...Donna Craig-Brown, via Associated Press“Sadly the specimen is not a potato and is, in fact, the tuber of a type of gourd,” a spokesman for the organization wrote, adding, “For this reason we do unfortunately have to disqualify the application.”To those without green thumbs, “tuber of a type of gourd” might be frustratingly oblique wording. A tuber can be any kind of swollen underground stem — including a potato. Gourds, which include pumpkins, marrows and cucumbers, are entirely unrelated plants.So what is Doug really, where did it come from, and why did it show up in the garden near Hamilton, a city in New Zealand’s North Island? No clear answers have emerged.Chris Claridge, a horticulturist and the chief executive of the industry group Potatoes New Zealand, which assisted in the DNA testing, described the growth as a kind of scar tissue on a wound, similar to the lumps sometimes seen on trees after a branch is removed.“It could have had an infection, it could have had a disease, it could have just formed and grown as an accident of nature,” he said. “But it’s not even the same family as the potato.”He added: “Put it this way: We’re good at growing potatoes in New Zealand, but we’re not that good.”  For Mr. Craig-Brown, the result was disappointing. It was also a puzzle that kept him awake at night.“How could a bloody gourd get in my garden?” he recalled thinking.And then, a possible breakthrough.“There was a stage where I was growing these hybridized cucumbers, right where Doug appeared,” he said. “During a hybridization process, who’s to say they didn’t crossbreed it with a gourd plant to give it tremendous disease resistance or prolific flowering?”In a statement, Adam Millward, managing editor of Guinness World Records, said, “This has been a fascinating journey of discovery, and we’re glad we’ve been able to get to the root — well, technically, tuber — of the matter.”He also wished the Craig-Browns the best in their future horticultural endeavors.As for Doug, Mr. Craig-Brown said: “He’s a pretty cool character, aye.”“He’s pretty happy sitting there in the cryogenic storage facility that we’ve got here on the farm — the deep freezer. He’s not fazed at all.” "
"Oxxxymiron, Russian Rapper, Brings a Banned Antiwar Message to Istanbul",2022-03-19 04:39:30.405000+00:00,"ISTANBUL — Only a month ago it would have been an innocuous scene in Moscow: Oxxxymiron, one of Russia’s most popular rappers, performing his latest tracks onstage with a banner behind him reading: “Russians against war.”But after President Vladimir V. Putin decided to invade Ukraine, what had been typical for the rapper, known for his political sloganeering, quickly became impossible.On Tuesday, instead of playing one of a string of six long-anticipated, sold-out arena shows in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Oxxxymiron gave an antiwar concert in a packed club in Istanbul, while streaming the performance on YouTube and other platforms in the hope that people in Russia would watch and donate. He promised that all proceeds, including ticket sales, would go to help the more than three million Ukrainian refugees who have fled Russian aggression.A crowd of Russians, many of whom had left their own country over the past three weeks, fearing Mr. Putin’s tightening oppression, filled a club in Istanbul’s trendy Kadıköy district, chanting “No to war!” and “Glory to Ukraine!” — slogans that could now get them jailed at home.  “Millions in Russia are against this war,” said Oxxxymiron, also known as Miron Fyodorov.“I hate feeling so powerless, but I understand well that what we are doing today is the absolute minimum,” he said during the concert. “This is important not only to Ukraine but to Russia, too, which we can lose.”Thanks to the internet, rap has become a dominant genre in Russian pop culture over the past few years, with new stars defying the government’s preferred aesthetics and values. At one point the Kremlin, worried that it might lose the loyalty of young Russians, put pressure on some of the most outspoken rap artists and shut down concerts.  Oxxxymiron has been a pioneer of the movement and a symbol of the post-Soviet generation of globalized Russians. After growing up in Russia and Germany, and getting a degree at Oxford, he returned to his native St. Petersburg and quickly became an ambassador of Russian rap on the international stage.Oxxxymiron may now be seen as one of Russian rap’s old guard, but his sentiments about the war are shared by many Russian artists across genres. Many of them either started their careers in Ukraine before moving to Russia or toured actively in Ukraine, building a fan base there.  After Valery Meladze, a pop singer who had regularly appeared on state-run channels, called for the war to end as soon as possible, he was quickly removed from some music channels in Russia, along with other pro-Ukrainian and Ukrainian artists.The rapper Face said that he had fled Russia and that he “practically” was no longer a Russian artist or citizen.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 30, 2022, 5:42 a.m. ETStrikes continue in the Chernihiv region, despite Russia’s promises.Putin’s war complicates India’s middle path among the global powers.Here are the latest developments in Ukraine.“I don’t plan to return to Russia, to pay taxes there,” Face, also known as Ivan Dryomin, wrote on Instagram. “Our state has forced me and my loved ones to leave our house, our land.”Not all Russian rappers oppose the invasion. Timati, who has supported Mr. Putin and been praised by him, argued that the war in Ukraine “was a forced measure taken by the country’s leadership.”“I love Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,” Timati, also known as Timur Yunusov, said in a social media post. “I am very sorry that we have been pushed against each other and that we couldn’t find a compromise.”Outside the Istanbul club where Oxxxymiron performed, people said they were still digesting the shock of Russia’s attack on what many consider a “brotherly nation.” Millions of Russians have relatives in Ukraine, and many worked, studied or spent parts of their childhoods there.  “I feel complete powerlessness and anger for what is happening, that you cannot influence anything,” said Natalia, 32, an I.T. engineer from Belarus, who said her country was “an accomplice in this war.”  “I don’t understand how anyone could support it,” said Natalia, who declined to give her last name, fearing repercussions against relatives back home.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks.

At the same time, a common refrain was that they were powerless to change their country’s political course.Anna, an art historian from St. Petersburg, said she had been protesting Mr. Putin’s rule for years. She said she had to flee Russia after a criminal case was opened against a friend.“I don’t feel I am personally guilty, but I am ashamed of my state,” said Anna, 26, who declined to give her last name because she has family in Russia. “I fought against the regime, my friends fought against it, but we ended up either here or in prison.”Others said Russians had been too preoccupied with their day-to-day problems to try to change the political situation.“We always try to adapt — even now, we flee the country and settle here, while the war in Ukraine is ongoing and people die there,” said Yevgeny Yankovoy, 46.  He was standing outside the club, holding a poster that read: “We allowed for this war to happen. We are too busy now.” "
Mass Graves in Syria Could Hold Evidence of War C,2022-03-16 11:04:07+00:00,"BERLIN — By day, the workers used heavy machinery to dig pits and trenches. After dark, the corpses arrived, sometimes hundreds at a time, in the beds of military pickups or in refrigerator trucks meant for transporting food.As government intelligence officers looked on, the dead were dumped into the ground and buried near the capital, Damascus, according to men who worked at two mass grave sites in Syria. Sometimes, the workers packed the dirt down tightly to keep dogs from digging up the bodies.Throughout Syria’s 11-year civil war, human rights groups and government defectors have documented the widespread killing of civilians by the security forces as they sought to stamp out any opposition to the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad.Now, The New York Times has gathered evidence that sheds new light on one enduring mystery of the war: What happened to the bodies of the many thousands who died or were killed in government detention centers?  Interviews over the past several months with four Syrian men who worked at or near secret mass graves led to an examination of satellite images. Together, those clues revealed the locations of two sites. Each one holds thousands of bodies, according to the men who worked there. They could also contain powerful evidence of war crimes committed by Mr. al-Assad’s forces, according to human rights groups, including the systematic torture and the killing of detainees.“If the issue of the missing and the disappeared is not resolved, there can never be peace in Syria,” said Diab Serrih, the co-founder of an association of former detainees in Syria’s notorious Saydnaya prison that has worked to locate mass graves. “Every day, we get calls from people who want to know where their sons are,” he added. Many of them say, “‘I just want to see a grave so that I can put a flower on it.’”  After the uprising that led to the war began in 2011, Mr. al-Assad activated his network of security agencies to stamp out dissent by locking up protesters, activists and others.At least 14,000 of those detainees were tortured to death, the U.S. Treasury Department said last year, but the actual number is almost certainly much higher. More than 130,000 others have disappeared into government detention centers, and many of them are presumed dead.  The Syrian government has repeatedly denied that it killed people in detention. But human rights groups have extensively documented the practice. One important body of evidence came from a Syrian police photographer, code named “Caesar,” who fled the country in 2013 with images of more than 6,000 dead bodies, some bearing signs of torture.The Lasting Effect of Syria’s Civil WarAfter a decade of fighting, many Syrians wonder if their country can be put back together.The ISIS Fight Isn't Over: Attacks in Syria and Iraq make it clear that the Islamic State is re-emerging as a serious threat.A Landmark Trial: A German court convicted a former Syrian officer of crimes against humanity in a historic verdict for those seeking justice.Bashar al-Assad’s Tenuous Grip: Even though he has regained nominal control of most of the country, the Syrian president remains mired in crises.A Drug Empire Flourishes: Powerful associates of Mr. al-Assad are making and selling amphetamines, turning Syria into a new narcostate.Counting and identifying the bodies in the mass graves would only be possible by digging them up. But that is unlikely to happen as long as Mr. al-Assad remains in power. Russia, his strongest backer, continues to support him, and he and his senior officials have never been held accountable for atrocities such as the use of chemical weapons against their own citizens.To draw attention to those atrocities, the Syrian Emergency Task Force, an advocacy group, brought one of the men interviewed by The New York Times to Washington this week to speak with members of Congress and others about the mass graves.Many of the bodies of those who died in detention were sent to government hospitals, where their deaths were recorded, according to reports by Human Rights Watch and others. The four men interviewed described what happened next.All four worked on or near mass graves near Damascus and each saw parts of the government’s efforts to dispose of bodies. Two of the men are now refugees in Germany, one is in Lebanon and one remains in Syria. Three spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by the Syrian government.The Times could not independently corroborate all the details in their accounts, including the total numbers of bodies they recalled seeing. And they each saw only part of the government’s burial operations, which human rights groups say were likely replicated in other mass grave sites across the country.  But their accounts were largely consistent with each other and with reports by human rights groups that have documented widespread deaths in detentions and the transfer of bodies to hospitals.  One of the men interviewed testified about what he witnessed at a landmark trial in Germany about war crimes in Syria that concluded this year with a life sentence for a former Syrian intelligence official convicted of crimes against humanity.He said he had worked before the war for the Damascus regional government overseeing civilian burials. In mid-2011, intelligence officers recruited him to dispose of corpses coming through hospitals from detention centers, he said. He did this work for six years at the two mass grave sites.The first mass grave site his team worked at, from mid-2011 until early 2013, was in a civilian cemetery in Najha, a town south of Damascus, he said. At first, he oversaw a few laborers who buried small numbers of bodies, he said. But as the conflict grew more violent, the numbers increased and he became what he described as a cog in a vast bureaucracy of death.He was given a white Nissan bus adorned with photos of Mr. al-Assad, a military uniform and a permit that allowed him to cross checkpoints, he said. Before dawn, he would drive more than a dozen workers to the mass graves.Separately, large refrigerator trucks meant to transport food brought the corpses from the hospitals to the graves, he said. When they arrived, his team would dump the bodies in the ground. Many of the bodies had bruises, lesions and missing fingernails, he said, and some were decomposing — indicating it had been some time since their deaths.He did not bury the bodies himself, he said, but oversaw the workers and received papers from the hospitals saying how many bodies had come from each detention facility. He recorded those numbers in a logbook in his office, but left those papers behind when he fled Syria in 2017, he said.  At some points during the six years he worked at the mass graves, his team unloaded two trucks about twice per week, each carrying anywhere from 150 to as many as 600 bodies, he said. The team also received a few dozen bodies per week from Saydnaya prison, which Amnesty International once branded “a human slaughterhouse,” where torture was rampant and prisoners were often killed.The bodies that came from Saydnaya often appeared to be recent deaths, he said, adding that some had what looked like rope marks around their necks or gunshot wounds. Sometimes, they dumped the bodies in trenches and covered them with dirt. At other times, they stacked up to eight bodies in graves meant for a single body, he said.Understanding Syria’s Civil WarCard 1 of 6An enduring conflict. The Syrian war began 11 years ago with a peaceful uprising against the government and spiraled into a multisided conflict involving armed rebels, jihadists and others. Here is what to know:The origins. The conflict began in 2011 when Syrians rose up peacefully against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The protests were met with a violent crackdown, while communities took up arms to defend themselves. Civil war ensued.Other groups became involved. Amid the chaos, Syria’s ethnic Kurdish minority took up arms and gradually took territory it saw as its own. The Islamic State seized parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014 and declared that territory its “caliphate,” further destabilizing the region.Foreign interventions. Mr. al-Assad received vital support from Iran and Russia, as well as the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The rebels were backed by the United States and oil-rich Arab states like Saudi Arabia. Turkey also intervened to stop the advance of Kurdish militias.The toll. The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Forces loyal to Mr. al-Assad have committed by far the most atrocities. The regime has turned to chemical weapons, barrel bombs and starvation to force Syrians into submission.Syria today. After more than a decade of fighting, the war has settled into a stalemate. Most of the country is nominally back under Mr. al-Assad’s control, but a crushing economic crisis has hobbled reconstruction efforts, impoverished the population and left many facing starvation.Satellite images of the Najha cemetery during that period show graves filling up, and one image from 2012 shows a truck with its rear pointed toward the graves and a white vehicle nearby, possibly a bus.  During the trial in Germany for the former Syrian intelligence officer convicted of crimes again humanity, two other people also testified about mass graves in Najha.One of them was Eyad al-Gharib, a former Syrian official convicted last year of complicity in crimes against humanity for driving arrested protesters to a security office known for torture. He told the court that dead detainees were buried in Najha if their bodies showed signs of torture.Another man interviewed by The New York Times was a bulldozer driver who worked in the Najha cemetery for seven months in 2012. He said intelligence officers overseeing the burials told him to dig large square pits.  He, too, described refrigerator trucks arriving a few times per week throughout the time he worked there, carrying hundreds of bodies each time that the workers dumped into the ground. He covered them with dirt, he said, sometimes rolling his bulldozer over the site to pack it down tightly to prevent dogs from digging up the bodies.He recalled the smell of death being so strong that it made him faint.Once, he said, seven bodies, including two women and a child, arrived in an ice cream truck. The sight still haunts him a decade later in Germany, where he is a refugee.“I can no longer eat ice cream,” he said.In early 2013, the man who drove the white bus said the government started a new mass grave near a Syrian army base in Qutayfa, a town north of Damascus.There, a motorized excavator dug trenches up to 100 yards long, he said. When the refrigerator trucks arrived, they inclined their beds to dump the bodies in one end of the trench. If they got stuck, the workers dragged them into the trench, where the excavator buried them.  The next group of bodies went in the next part of the trench, a grueling process that was repeated until the trench was full, he said. Then, the excavator would dig a new trench.Based on his accounts, The New York Times located the site and examined satellite images from that period that showed long trenches that were gradually filled with dirt. Some images show an excavator at the site, and at least one shows a white bus.  Walid Hashim, a former soldier who served in Qutayfa before defecting at the end of 2012, identified the same location as a mass grave. In a phone interview, he said the site was a shooting range that the government dug up to bury the bodies of people who had died in custody.The area was closely guarded to keep people away, he said, but everyone on the base knew what it was for.“You didn’t talk about it or ask about it,” Mr. Hashim said. “But everyone who worked there knew about the graveyard.”Christoph Koettl contributed reporting from New York, Karam Shoumali from Berlin and Asmaa al-Omar from Beirut.

"In Cambodia, Khmer Rouge Horrors Few Want to Rememb",2022-03-16 14:26:48+00:00,"SNA ANSA, Cambodia — The land mine that killed Ma Simet and two others was laid decades ago. The devices are designed to endure. They can outlast monsoons and droughts, years of political upheaval and submerged histories — until the cataclysmic moment of contact.On Jan. 10, under an early hot sun, the men worked to remove mines from a field, vestiges of a time when Cambodia was at war with itself and suffered as victim of a larger conflict. By late morning, they had discovered a Russian-made antitank mine. Nestled nearby, unseen by them, was an antipersonnel device, a deadly tactic targeting anyone trying to defuse the larger explosive.The two men closer to the detonation were obliterated. All that was left of one was a couple of fingers and a patch of scalp. Mr. Ma Simet was a bit further away. His body was found intact.“Even though his face was burned, it was like he was sleeping peacefully,” said Khuon Savin, his widow. “I don’t care about the history. I just want those mines gone before they hurt other people.”  The three men’s deaths are reminders of how an unearthed past continues to shatter Cambodia’s present, even if most of the population has no memory of the country’s deadliest years.Two-thirds of Cambodians are under the age of 30. They were born long after the Khmer Rouge unleashed its totalitarian terror and extinguished up to one-quarter of the nation’s population in the 1970s, long after the American carpet-bombing campaigns that poisoned their earth with 500,000 tons of ordnance during the Vietnam War.People want to gaze ahead, a natural impulse of the young — and of those who wish not to remember.But in soil still stained by the legacy of genocide and crimes against humanity, new blights have taken root: kleptocratic rulers, runaway corruption and a chasm of inequality.  Mr. Ma Simet knew the weight of history. His job deactivating unexploded ordnance was a daily reminder of a past that had ravaged his parents’ generation and that of their parents. His siblings knew the effort to eradicate mines was important, but they say there is little point in excavating the deeper truths about what happened long ago. His widow agrees.  Yet their lives will continue to be formed by this act of forgetting, and of the sudden surfacing of trauma. Far from being freed from history, Mr. Ma Simet’s eight siblings, whose ages span from 41 to 19, are living the arc of modern Cambodia, a time of phenomenal change but also tremendous imbalance.The current leadership of Cambodia has encouraged a national amnesia, allowing authoritarianism and its attendant ills to flourish again.The country is led by Hun Sen, a strongman who after 37 years in power is the world’s longest-serving prime minister. He started off in the Khmer Rouge before aligning himself with the forces that swept aside the regime. Mr. Hun Sen has destroyed the political opposition, groomed his son as a successor and allowed for the enrichment of an elite that once espoused Communist ideals.At Mr. Ma Simet’s funeral in late January, in a shaded pagoda complex rebuilt after the Khmer Rouge destroyed it, his mother, Mak Leuk, received the mourners.The Great ReadMore fascinating tales you can’t help but read all the way to the end.Brash and funny, Emily Nunn uses her popular Substack newsletter, The Department of Salad, to hold forth about ageism, politics and, oh yes, leafy greens.For years, a virus hunter worried about animal markets causing a pandemic. Now he’s at the center of the debate over Covid’s origins.A few years ago, Nicola Coughlan was working in an optician’s office in Ireland. Now, with “Bridgerton” and “Derry Girls,” she’s starring in two of the most beloved shows on Netflix.“My son’s death had value for the nation,” she said, “but we have lost our blood.”Among those at the funeral was Kao Kea, the widow of Ms. Mak Leuk’s brother. He too, was killed by a land mine, nearly 30 years ago.Ms. Kao Kea, 58, shook her head at the chances that two men would be killed by these hidden remnants of the past, planted at the same time perhaps, but detonating a generation apart.  “The young generation, they don’t know about war, and even me, I’m from that generation, but I don’t know much about it either,” she said. “Maybe we should remember. Because if we don’t, what will stop us from making the same mistakes again?”Hidden historiesMr. Ma Simet, 32, took a job deactivating land mines to spare his new wife the danger. Before he and Ms. Khuon Savin married, she worked for a nongovernmental group called Cambodian Self Help Demining.Over the years, about 20,000 Cambodians have been killed by unexploded ordnance scattered across the country by warring forces: the Khmer Rouge, the Americans, the Vietnamese and other Cambodian factions.Each work day, she strapped on body armor and ran a metal detector over the earth, helping to deactivate a mine when she found one. For this perilous work, Ms. Khuon Savin made about $300 a month.After they wed in 2013, her new husband insisted on taking the risk instead.“He wanted to make Cambodia safe,” Ms. Khuon Savin said. “He was proud of our country.”For all the strides Cambodia has made — three decades of peace and economic growth, at least until the coronavirus pandemic — the country is still defined by its violent past. Like Rwanda, Srebrenica or Darfur, Cambodia stands as a byword for the worst impulses of humanity.  Yet much of that past remains unspoken, even if Cambodia’s youth are confronting the nation’s repressive leaders. Most of the textbooks that educated today’s young adults touched lightly on the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge. In villages, those who killed still live next to relatives of those they killed. Within families, personal histories are obscured.Before the Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975, Ms. Khuon Savin’s mother had been from a comfortable family. Her father spoke French, the language of the former colonizers. For that bourgeois affectation, she said, he was taken for a “study session” and never came back.Such executions were common in Democratic Kampuchea, as the Khmer Rouge renamed the country, where an agrarian utopia was to replace a decadent capitalism. People were killed for wearing glasses, a sign of education. They were killed for every and any reason.In late January, Ms. Khuon Savin sat with her parents mourning her husband.Ms. Khuon Savin knew that her father, Khuon Khai, 63, had been a soldier for a Cambodian force that battled the Khmer Rouge. This was after the Vietnamese invasion in late 1978, which ousted the more radical Communists.Sitting with his wife and daughter, Mr. Khuon Khai had a confession. After his mother died of starvation, he had served in the very force that had precipitated her death: the Khmer Rouge.“I just followed others,” he said. “I had no parents. I didn’t want to die.”It was the first time his daughter and wife had heard his secret. Days before, his son-in-law had been killed by a Khmer Rouge mine.  His wife, Soum Vai, looked at the man seated next to her, the man to whom she been married for 35 years.“I’m afraid of him now,” she said, covering her face. “My father, my family members, were killed by the Khmer Rouge.”A transistor radio sat next to Mr. Khuon Khai, its antenna leaning against the wall. He listens to Buddhist sermons every day.“It helps give me peace of mind, helps my sins to be forgiven,” he said.The next generationAt noon, Ma Syloun, the youngest of Mr. Ma Simet’s eight siblings, logs on to her college classes, which are being held online because of Covid. She doesn’t have a laptop, but she does have a scholarship to the Royal University of Law and Economics, and a Chinese-made smartphone to watch her professors.Cambodia’s youth have opportunities that the earlier postwar generation never enjoyed. Ms. Ma Syloun’s oldest sister works in a garment factory. Never having finished primary school, she can barely write her own name. For those who emerged from the Khmer Rouge era and the years of civil war, mere survival was an accomplishment.By the time Ms. Ma Syloun came along, she was not only able to finish high school, but also won funding for college in Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital — the only student from her high school that year who did. She decided to study law, her interest sparked by her family’s land being seized without proper compensation.Over the past two decades, much of Cambodia’s farmland and forests has ended up in the hands of foreign investors and local developers tied to the ruling Cambodian People’s Party. Socialist in its founding, the governing force has long since embraced the trappings of capitalism, defending its material gains with thuggery and graft.  The streets of Phnom Penh, a city once emptied of cars by the Khmer Rouge, later the domain of United Nations peacekeeping vehicles, are now choked with the traffic jams common in many Asian megacities. Vast villa complexes, gilded with Louis XIV flourishes and Venetian domes, ring the capital on what was once farmland.The progeny of former Marxist revolutionaries are some of the most conspicuous consumers of Cambodia’s new money — and their impunity is fiercely protected. A political activist who exposed the business empire controlled by Mr. Hun Sen’s extended family was fatally shot while sitting at a Phnom Penh cafe.The wealth gap can seem unbridgeable to many Cambodians, even if those living in absolute poverty has declined sharply. En Poy, 33, the sole survivor of the Jan. 10 accident that killed Mr. Ma Simet and two others, was maimed by another land mine when he was a child. He has dodged death twice, lost an eye and part of an arm.  He is so deeply in debt that he is considering returning to his job finding land mines. More than half of Cambodian households, his included, owe money to what critics say are predatory microfinancing institutions.Some of Ms. Ma Syloun’s classmates, rich students from Phnom Penh, don’t understand why she cannot join calls for some group projects. To afford life in Phnom Penh, she works at a restaurant, seven days a week, for $80 a month. Since she’s studying on her phone, she writes her assignments on paper.“They say they’ll take my name off the group work,” she said. “They say I’m lazy.”She shows photos of these classmates, posing on social media, sipping icy drinks in air conditioning.Ms. Ma Syloun brings rice from her village of Sna Ansa to Phnom Penh. It’s cheaper than buying city rice. Her father has sold a buffalo and cows for her education.She acknowledges that her chances of becoming a lawyer are slim. Many white-collar jobs are secured through connections and under-the-table payments, the kind of inequalities that led many Cambodians to initially welcome the Khmer Rouge.“In our country, without money and a strong network, you are nothing,” she said.Searching for justiceOn the outskirts of Phnom Penh, on a dusty road crowded with motorcycles and trucks carrying garment workers to factories, stands a cream-colored edifice set against a vast lawn: the Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of Cambodia.There, over the past 16 years, what are known as the Khmer Rouge trials have unfolded, through a United Nations-sponsored process that was supposed to bring a measure of justice and catharsis to Cambodia. This, though, is hardly the Nuremberg trials, which delved into Nazi horrors, or South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was meant to help mend the rifts of apartheid.  The Khmer Rouge trials have cost more than $300 million. Yet only three defendants have been found guilty. Two others died in the course of the trials, and two cases against lower-level commanders were dismissed, one in December.  From the beginning, the scope of the court, with its mix of Cambodian and international judges, was limited to a handful of men and women who were considered senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge, or those most responsible for its horrors.Mr. Hun Sen’s government worked to slow down the effort, according to human rights lawyers and legal scholars. Dredging the past could be risky for the ruling party, which is stocked with Khmer Rouge defectors and their disciples.“The artifacts of a terrible history, the experience of surviving genocide, shapes Cambodia’s future,” said Sophal Ear, a dean at the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University, whose father died during the Khmer Rouge era.Yet without the burden of those memories, Cambodia’s youth may be better suited to fight Mr. Hun Sen’s autocracy, through activism and online dissent. Unlike the generations that survived the Khmer Rouge years, they have not been conditioned to keep quiet to stay alive. Dozens of young activists are now in prison.  “If you’re only looking at the past, then it’s hard to escape it,” Mr. Ear said. “Because they didn’t live through the awful history, it’s the young who are willing to face the ex-Khmer Rouge guys running the government.”When she was in high school, Ms. Ma Syloun visited the court with her mother, Ms. Mak Leuk, whose younger sister was taken in for questioning by the Khmer Rouge and never seen again. Ms. Mak Leuk’s parents died of disease when she was 11 years old. Decades on, she, unlike many others, has told her nine children of these tragedies, of the three cups of rice stretched into a watery gruel for 150 people, of her skeletal frame with legs swollen from malnutrition.“They don’t believe it,” she said. “I tell them it’s true.”Sitting at her brother’s funeral, Ms. Ma Syloun said her mother has told her those stories, over and over.Buddhist monks chanted, the incantations broadcast by loudspeaker over a village where history’s aggressors and victims still coexist, where farmers’ landholdings grow smaller with each year.  “I don’t want to think about this terrible history,” Ms. Ma Syloun said. “It’s better to look forward.”Sun Narin contributed reporting.

Oligarchs Got Richer Despite Sanctions. Will This Time Be Different?,2022-03-16 20:54:15+00:00,"The first time the United States government slapped his family with sanctions and locked him out of the American financial system, Arkady Rotenberg waited about eight weeks, investigators say, before buying a $7.5 million painting in New York City.That was in 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea, and since then the sanctions have hardly slowed down Mr. Rotenberg, a lifelong friend and former judo partner of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. His estimated worth sits at about $3 billion, and his brother, Boris, became a billionaire after sanctions were imposed on him. Investigators have tracked at least $91 million passing into the American economy from accounts linked to the Rotenberg family.Today, as Mr. Putin’s soldiers lay siege to neighboring Ukraine, world leaders have responded by strangling the Russian economy. Major Russian banks have been cut off from the global financial system, the government faces default, and many multinationals are closing their Russian operations.And a new raft of European and American sanctions has been announced, against Mr. Putin himself, as well as those considered close to him, including Boris Rotenberg and Arkady Rotenberg’s son, Igor. The logic now is the same as it was in 2014: Squeeze Mr. Putin’s allies to put pressure on him.  “We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,” President Biden said in his State of the Union address.But despite such boasts, coming at what some analysts call a watershed moment, the question is whether the West can make its sanctions bite after largely failing to do so in the past. Arkady Rotenberg is just one example of the past ineffectiveness of measures described as the “financial death penalty.”A New York Times analysis of global corporate filings identified nearly 200 companies associated with the Rotenbergs, spread across three continents and a dozen countries. Many of the firms are now inactive, but even after Mr. Rotenberg was placed on sanctions lists in 2014, he was able to take a stake in at least seven companies in European offshore tax havens.  As recently as 2020, Mr. Rotenberg became the beneficial owner of two companies — Robben Investments and Lucasnel S.A. — in Luxembourg, a tiny European Union country known as a tax haven for shell companies. Corporate records suggest Mr. Rotenberg still owns those companies.   Multiple messages seeking comment from the Rotenbergs went unanswered at SMP Bank, which the brothers co-founded.Mr. Rotenberg has stayed wealthy and spent lavishly because governments rarely investigate or try to untangle the fortunes of those they target. As oligarchs hired high-priced accountants, lawyers and other middlemen to conceal their assets, governments largely left it to banks and companies to figure out for themselves whether they were doing business with people on the blacklists.Government investigators ignored reports of suspicious banking activity. European leaders promised to bring transparency to the financial system but dragged their feet in doing it. Congress voted to give the Treasury Department the authority to crack open shell companies but left that power unfunded for years. And Britain looked the other way as it became a playground and safe haven for Russia’s rich and powerful.“The general view of illicit finance has been a deep sense of being under-concerned,” said Phil Mason, who served as a senior adviser to the British government on international corruption for nearly 20 years. He said lawmakers saw Russian money as a source of jobs and investments.“There was a complete blind spot as to seeing it as a problem,” said Mr. Mason. “In the absence of the Ukraine crisis, it is still the prevailing attitude inside government.”But just as 9/11 forced world leaders to get serious about terrorist money, current and former government officials in the United States and Europe say the recent invasion of Ukraine could be a turning point on tackling illicit Russian wealth. The broad moves have already been without precedent — freezing assets of Russia’s central bank and banning Russian oil imports to the United States. A government spokesman said Britain was taking strong action and was “fully aligned with our allies and partners.”  And the efforts toward oligarchs also have been more widespread and coordinated. The European Union and the United States led the charge, but were followed by Britain, which had been more reluctant in the past. Australia, Japan, Canada and others joined, shrinking the world market for Russian wealth. Even secretive Switzerland said it would freeze Russian assets.  The United States Justice Department and Britain’s National Crime Agency, for instance, both recently announced task forces for tracing Russian assets and enforcing sanctions.“The oligarchs are important because they are the ones who would trigger a palace coup if it ever happened,” said Tom Keatinge, a financial crime expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a British research body. “And we know that Putin relies on people close to him to hide his money.”Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 29, 2022, 8:56 p.m. ETA NASA astronaut will soon fly home to Earth in a Russian spacecraft. Here’s how to watch.Orthodox leader calls the invasion of Ukraine ‘atrocious’ but stops short of denouncing Putin by name.Russia says it’s pulling back from Kyiv. These soldiers say they’re still ready to fight.How to Hide a Russian FortuneThere is no secret to how Russian oligarchs like Mr. Rotenberg have hidden their money. A U.S. Senate investigative report, released in 2020, found money pinballing across the globe: a company in Belize was doing business in London with a majority shareholder living in Cyprus and a bank account in Estonia, to cite one example from the report.It is a pattern that investigators say is common.First, a trusted lawyer or other agent sets up a shell company in an offshore jurisdiction with little transparency. On paper, the company has its own director. But really, somebody else calls the shots.This company can own other shell companies, making it even harder to identify what investigators call the “ultimate beneficial owner.” These companies can then have bank accounts in jurisdictions that are known for secrecy.In this way, the shell company can transfer money or make purchases without anyone knowing the real owner. This is typically legal.  “We’re talking about people with limitless resources to move money and avoid scrutiny,” said David H. Laufman, a lawyer with Wiggin and Dana who used to run the Justice Department’s counterintelligence section.To set up this network, investigators found, the Rotenbergs turned to Mark Omelnitski, a Briton who was born in Moscow and specialized in setting up opaque networks of shell companies. Senate investigators found a company handbook showing how, for as little as a thousand dollars, Mr. Omelnitski’s company, the Markom Group, would establish offshore companies for his clients.  “Companies organized by Omelnitski and his group suggest that Markom may potentially have created numerous companies for Russian oligarchs and close acquaintances of Russian President, Vladimir Putin,” an internal investigation by the British bank Barclays concluded.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.Barclays closed 198 bank accounts associated with Mr. Omelnitski’s Markom Group in August 2017. But he still runs a network of British and offshore companies. He is not known to have faced sanctions or criminal charges. Letters requesting comment went unanswered by Mr. Omelnitski, who deactivated his LinkedIn profile after being contacted by a Times reporter.Until now, neither the United States nor British governments have prioritized going after oligarchs, partly because unraveling their networks takes time, manpower and international cooperation. Banks are required to alert the authorities when they spot suspicious activity, but even when they do, government officials can be slow to act. One senior Senate aide said that Rotenberg investigators found countless examples of banks filing reports with the Department of Treasury, to no avail.For years, governments resisted efforts to require greater financial transparency, even as leaked documents like the Panama Papers made clear how secrecy allowed illicit money to move.  The European Union, for example, passed a regulation in 2018 that said the public should have access to information about who owns European companies, even those nested in shell companies. Four years later, after delays from 17 countries, no such registry exists.Congress passed a similar transparency law in 2021. But until this week, lawmakers had not provided the $63 million to enact it. Treasury officials are working on regulations now that would help pierce the veil of secrecy around shell companies.A New Approach?Governments may need to change laws to tackle the problem.In the United States, the authorities have broad powers to seize property if they suspect a crime has been committed. Investigators caution, however, that they do not expect to find many oligarch fortunes in American bank accounts, or Russian superyachts in American ports. The harder task, they said, will be identifying transactions in real time when the buyers have concealed themselves behind shell companies and foreign banks, much as the Rotenbergs did for years.In France, the government is considering laws that would allow it to seize, not just freeze, assets belonging to blacklisted people. For now, the government can only seize things with evidence of a crime. (In a twist, however, France did seize the yacht of Igor Sechin, the head of the Russian state oil giant Rosneft, before it could leave port early this month. Fleeing sanctions, the government said, would itself be a crime.)  Similarly, the British government announced last week that it had seized a private jet suspected of being linked to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. But the government’s argument — that it could seize the jet under a ban on Russian-linked aircraft entering Britain — has yet to be tested. And the plane in question is registered not in Britain or Russia, but in Luxembourg.The anti-corruption organization Transparency International estimates that nearly $2 billion worth of British property is owned by Russians accused of financial crime or linked to the Kremlin.  Britain has been slow over the years to impose sanctions on those oligarchs. Some, like the Rotenbergs, have long been blacklisted by other countries and are only now making the British list.But London is moving with newfound decisiveness. More than five years after it was proposed, Parliament recently passed a law prohibiting people from hiding behind offshore companies when buying property. And last week, the British government finally hit Mr. Abramovich with sanctions more than a decade after corruption allegations and evidence of ties to the Kremlin first emerged. His soccer team, Chelsea, was already for sale when his assets were frozen; lawmakers said he was also seeking to sell his London real estate, which includes a mansion in Kensington.Court records from a divorce dispute show that Arkady Rotenberg owns a $35 million mansion in a village in Surrey, south of London, which was purchased through a British Virgin Islands entity with the help of the law firm Hogan Lovells. His nephew, Roman Rotenberg, who is also subject to U.S. sanctions, listed his address as a $4.3 million London townhouse owned by a Cypriot entity.“Successive governments have chosen not to grapple with this issue,” said Mr. Keatinge, the financial crime expert.But even with all the changes, gaps remain. After the Senate report demonstrated how Arkady Rotenberg purchased fine art in the United States, lawmakers like Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, tried to force art dealers to abide by the same anti-secrecy requirements as banks.Under heavy lobbying from auction houses, lawmakers killed the idea and allowed art sales to remain anonymous.Constant Méheut contributed reporting.

"After Six-Year Ordeal in Iran, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe Is Freed",2022-03-17 01:21:10+00:00,"LONDON — After six years in Tehran separated from her family, first in prison and then under house arrest, a British-Iranian woman’s ordeal in detention in Iran is finally over.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe — arrested in Tehran’s airport in 2016 on her way home to London, and used as a diplomatic pawn, her family says — was finally reunited with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and daughter, Gabriella.Her release, and that of another British-Iranian citizen, Anoosheh Ashoori, came after the settlement of a longstanding British debt to Iran that had roiled relations between the two countries, according to Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss.Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr. Ashoori, who spent years detained in the same Tehran prison, were taken to an airport on Wednesday and flown back to Britain after a stop in Oman. Their flight arrived in Oxfordshire early Thursday morning, according to Reuters and a video that Mr. Ashoori’s daughter, Elika Ashoori, posted on social media.  “Great to see both Anoosheh and Nazanin in such good spirits,” Ms. Truss wrote on Twitter after they landed. “An emotional moment for both families as they welcome them home.”  The case of Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian charity worker who had been visiting family in Iran when she was arrested, drew considerable media attention in part because of the efforts by her family and her organization to publicize her case.Richard Ratcliffe, her husband, has dedicated the past six years to public advocacy for his wife, staging a number of hunger strikes in front of the Iranian Embassy in London.But accusations that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had mishandled her case early on, when he was serving as foreign secretary, had also raised Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s profile.  Speaking in Parliament in 2017, Mr. Johnson told lawmakers that “she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it,” comments that rights groups said harmed her case in Iran.Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was not teaching journalism, was not a journalist, and was on vacation in Iran at the time of her detention, her employer has maintained. She was employed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the London-based charitable arm of the Thomson Reuters news organization.Speaking outside of Parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Ratcliffe told reporters of his wife’s arrival: “We’re looking forward to a new life.”“You can’t get back the time that’s gone, that’s a fact,” Mr. Ratcliffe added. “But we live in the future, not the past.”Mr. Ashoori, 67, a British-Iranian retired engineer arrested in 2017, was also back in Britain after being released in Tehran. Miran Hassan, a spokesman for his family, said Mr. Ashoori and Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe were on the same flight.“I just hope I will able to contain my joy and my happiness,” Sherry Izadi, Mr. Ashoori’s wife, said before she was due to meet him at the airport. “I hope I don’t have a heart attack.”Ms. Izadi had dropped off her husband at London’s Gatwick Airport on Aug. 17, 2017, expecting to pick him up three weeks later. She would not see him for almost five years.  Ms. Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary, said the government had secured the release from prison of a third dual British-Iranian citizen, Morad Tahbaz, on furlough and was working to get him out of Iran.The British Foreign Office said the government had settled a debt to Iran over a failed arms deal in “parallel” with the agreement for the release of Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Mr. Ashoori and Mr. Tahbaz. Mr. Tahbaz also holds American citizenship.Britain signed the deal, worth 400 million pounds or about $522 million, with the shah of Iran before the Iranian revolution, but had not delivered the weapons by the time Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took power and then chose not to do so.Ms. Truss said in an emailed statement that she had made “resolving the continued detention of British nationals” and the payment of the debt “top priorities” since she entered office last fall, and that negotiators had been sent to Tehran to secure their release.Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, also confirmed that Iran had received payment of the debt from Britain, but said there was “no relationship between the release of the money and the people arrested in Iran on security charges.”“We received the money a few days ago,” he said. “The release of these two individuals was with a humanitarian view.”The news that Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliff and Mr. Ashoori were returning to Britain was met with jubilation by rights advocates.  “We are incredibly relieved that Nazanin will finally be reunited with her family in the U.K. after a horrific six-year ordeal,” said Rupert Skilbeck, director of Redress, a rights organization that had campaigned for her release. “Nazanin has endured unimaginable suffering,” he added.The latest moves also came as American and European negotiators were edging toward the renewal of a pact limiting Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions on the country.The release of Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 44, a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, came after a series of seeming breakthroughs in her case — and sudden barriers to releasing her.Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been charged with plotting to overthrow the Iranian government and was eventually sentenced to five years in prison. Her daughter, Gabriella, 2 at the time, was with her when she was detained in 2016 and initially stayed in Iran so that she could be brought for visits by her grandparents. But Gabriella returned to London in 2019 to be with her father and to start school.Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe endured difficult periods during her years of imprisonment in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, with time in solitary confinement and periods of illness and stress, according to her family.Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was moved to house arrest in her family’s home in Tehran in 2020, during the coronavirus epidemic, and when she was permitted to stop wearing an ankle tag last year at the end of that sentence, freedom seemed close.Instead, she was dragged back into court to face new charges — this time of “propaganda activities.” She was banned from travel and sentenced to another year of detention.  Her family and former colleagues denied all the shifting charges against her, accusing the Iranian government of using her as a diplomatic pawn.Mr. Ashoori’s family had also said he was being used as a bargaining chip between Britain and Iran and called the charges against him “bogus.”  Mr. Ashoori was accused of spying for Israel, among other charges, and sentenced in 2019 to a 12-year prison sentence in the same prison in Tehran where Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was held.Rights groups said the releases were long overdue.“Nazanin and Anoosheh have unquestionably been used as political pawns by the Iranian authorities — and the Iranian authorities have acted with calculated cruelty, seeking to wring the maximum diplomatic value out of their captivity,” said Sacha Deshmukh, chief executive of Amnesty International U.K.Mr. Deshmukh called on the British government to renew calls for the release of another person with British and Iranian citizenship, Mehran Raoof, who remains in Iranian custody. Many, including Antonio Zappulla, the head of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, saw the release as a rare bit of hopeful news at a troubling global moment.“In a time when the world is in turmoil and the news has been consistently bleak, Nazanin’s freedom is a ray of light and hope,” he said. “Her reunion with her family cannot come soon enough, and we cannot wait to have her back with us.”Mike Ives contributed reporting from Seoul.

Impunity for Syria War Crimes   Casts  Shadow Over Ukrain,2022-03-16 03:54:00+00:00,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Syrian police stormed her house and dragged her husband away. Her eldest son died in a rain of Syrian government shells on her hometown. So like millions of other Syrians, Hanadi Hafisi fled the country with plans to return when the war ended.A decade later, she’s still a refugee in Turkey, where her work at a center that treats war injuries exposes her to a constant display of the human destruction wrought by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and his Russian backers: paralysis, missing hands and legs, and deep trauma that leaves her patients asking why such disasters consumed their lives.“I don’t know what to tell them when they ask me whether they will reach justice,” said Ms. Hafisi, 46. “Seriously, what to tell them? That Bashar will be held accountable? That he will face trial? Of course not.”As the world takes in the grim realities of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — the once-vibrant neighborhoods bombed out, the civilians killed by shells while trying to flee, the speculation about whether Russia will use chemical weapons — many Syrians have watched with a horrifying sense of déjà vu and a deep foreboding about what lies ahead.  The Syrian war began 11 years ago this month with an anti-Assad uprising that spiraled into a multisided conflict among the government, armed rebels, jihadists and others. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, millions have fled their homes, and Mr. al-Assad has remained in power, in large part because of the extensive support he received from the man now driving the invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.  The legacy of Syria’s war, and Russia’s role in it, looms large over Ukraine, offering potential lessons to Mr. Putin, analysts said: that “red lines” laid down by the West can be crossed without long-term consequences; that diplomacy purportedly aimed at stopping violence can be used to distract from it; and that autocrats can do terrible things and face international sanctions — and still stay in power.Much of the brutality Mr. al-Assad deployed to quash his foes was documented in real time and spurred outrage that left many thinking he could never get away with it.He dispatched soldiers and armed thugs to stop protests by locking up activists and firing live ammunition into crowds. As the opposition took up arms, his troops shelled, bombed and imposed starvation sieges on towns and neighborhoods that supported the rebels.  Those actions killed large numbers of civilians and sent many more fleeing for their lives. More than half of Syria’s prewar population was displaced during the war, and 5.7 million refugees remain outside the country.In August 2013, Mr. al-Assad’s forces shocked the world by deploying chemical weapons on rebel-held towns near the capital, Damascus, killing more than 1,400 people, U.S. officials said.Many Syrians expected that such a blatant violation of international law would prompt Western military intervention, especially since President Barack Obama had called the use of chemical weapons a “red line.”  “I was sure we had witnessed something very few people had experienced before, like those who witnessed Chernobyl or Hiroshima,” recalled Ibrahim Alfawal, 29, who survived the chemical attack and said it had felt like “judgment day.”But he was shocked when the United States did not intervene. Mr. al-Assad’s forces eventually took control of the towns that had been gassed, seeming to pay no price for his use of forbidden arms.That seemed to show that Mr. al-Assad could count on impunity, Mr. Alfawal said, and attacks by Syrian forces on civilian infrastructure — including schools, hospitals, neighborhoods and bakeries where families had lined up to buy bread — only escalated.  In 2015, Mr. Putin sent Russian forces to help Mr. al-Assad’s beleaguered army, and soon Russian officers were advising Syrian forces and Russian jets were dropping bombs on Syrian cities — enjoying the same impunity that Mr. al-Assad seemed to have.In Ukraine, Russia has used disinformation campaigns similar to those it pioneered in Syria, where it falsely branded opposition activists as members of Al Qaeda and accused the rebels of launching the chemical attacks as “false flag” operations to blame the Syrian government.“They are taking the same concept they used in Syria, to lie and to stick to it,” Mr. Alfawal said of Russia’s approach to Ukraine.The chemical attacks in Syria continued. In addition to two that killed large numbers of people — in the village of Khan Sheikhoun in 2017 and east of Damascus in 2018 — there have been at least 350 other attacks with chemical substances, according to Tobias Schneider, a researcher at the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin.  Most of those used chlorine, which is not classified as a chemical weapon but can be used as such to terrify civilians and encourage them to flee.While no evidence has surfaced that Russian forces used chemical weapons in Syria, researchers believe that Mr. Putin enabled Mr. al-Assad to do so.  “It is absolutely certain that the Russian government at least knows and likely facilitated the use of chemical weapons by the Syrians, mostly chlorine attacks,” Mr. Schneider said.There are no indications that chemical weapons have been used in Ukraine, but watching the war there, many Syrians see signs that Mr. Putin is employing parts of the Syria playbook.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.The Russians “are willing to devour the green and the dry,” said Radwan Alhomsy, a Syrian activist in southern Turkey, using an Arabic idiom meaning to destroy everything. “They don’t care about the international community or anything else. We saw that in Syria. Burning schools is not new to us. It’s land they want to take, and they will take it.”  European analysts point out the differences between the wars in Syria and Ukraine that could lead to different Western responses. Unlike Mr. Putin, Mr. al-Assad fought to regain control of his own country, not take over one of his neighbors. Unlike Syria, Russia is a nuclear-armed power, complicating the issue of military intervention.And while the United States and its European allies largely let Mr. al-Assad get away with using chemical weapons in the Middle East, Mr. Putin’s doing so on the European continent would most likely cause greater alarm and elicit a stiffer response.“If Putin thinks that he’ll be treated like al-Assad, he is wrong because he is not al-Assad and this is not Syria,” said Patricia Lewis, director of the international security program at Chatham House.  Still, Mr. Putin could take some solace from Mr. al-Assad’s survival: how the West went on mistakenly believing that Mr. al-Assad’s fall was unavoidable, and how he has clung to power despite sanctions that have strangled his economy and impoverished his people.Emile Hokayem, a Middle East analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, warned of two strategies used in Syria that the Russians could employ in Ukraine.One was Russia’s engagement in international diplomacy aimed at ending the violence as a way of distracting the West from the war on the ground. Another was the deliberate creation of a refugee crisis to bog down Europe and sap its resources.  “Creating a humanitarian catastrophe is part of the war strategy, not a secondary effect, because this is how you shift the burden on to the other side,” he said.Many Syrian refugees are watching the Ukraine war from impoverished camps across the Middle East or from European cities where they are struggling to start new lives.While some feel bitter about the warmth shown to fleeing Ukrainians, the Syrians also recall their own war, and hope the Ukrainians will fare better than they did.  “We were left alone to face our destiny,” said Mansour Abu al-Kheir, who survived two chemical attacks east of Damascus before fleeing as a refugee to southern Turkey. “I hope this won’t happen to the Ukrainians.”Cora Engelbrecht contributed reporting from London, and Hwaida Saad and Asmaa al-Omar from Beirut, Lebanon.

Honduras Judge Approves Extradition of Ex-President to U.S.,2022-03-17 04:37:35+00:00,"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Former President Juan Orlando Hernández should be extradited to the United States to face drug-trafficking and weapons charges, a Honduran judge ruled on Wednesday.The Honduran authorities detained Mr. Hernández in February, capping a spectacular downfall for one of Central America’s most powerful men.He is expected to appeal the extradition decision.During the court hearing, the judge presented a document sent by the United States Justice Department through the American embassy in the capital, Tegucigalpa, that laid out the charges against Mr. Hernández. His lawyers also presented at least 20 pieces of evidence in his defense.Mr. Hernández is accused of participating in a “violent drug-trafficking conspiracy” that since 2004 has transported 500 tons of cocaine from Venezuela and Colombia to the United States via Honduras, according to the document.  The authorities said he had received millions of dollars in bribes for facilitating the shipments and shielding traffickers from prosecution.The former president’s brother, Juan Antonio Hernández, is serving a life sentence in the United States for cocaine trafficking. Another convicted cocaine trafficker who implicated the former president, Geovanny Fuentes, received the same sentence.The former leader has denied having ties to drug traffickers. Addressing the court during a hearing on Wednesday, he questioned the motives behind the extradition process, according to Melvin Duarte, a court spokesman. Mr. Hernández has maintained that statements made against him by extradited drug traffickers came from people seeking revenge.Mr. Hernández led the country for eight years and stepped down in January, at the conclusion of his second term. When he was detained last month, he was escorted by security officers from his home, wearing a bulletproof vest and shackles that bound him hand and foot.  Fireworks exploded around Tegucigalpa after he was led away from his home, and about 100 protesters who had gathered around his residence celebrated his detention. "
"In South Korea, a Spike in Covid Cases Meets a Collective Shrug",2022-03-17 12:32:40+00:00,"SEOUL — South Korea reported its peak daily coronavirus infection number of the entire pandemic on Thursday, recording 621,328 cases in a country of 50 million people.It was the second straight day the country set a record, during a weeklong surge of Omicron cases that has dwarfed all its previous waves, with one in every 20 people testing positive over the past seven days.But during this surge, South Korea, which responded to past swells with all-out efforts to track, test and isolate the infected, is responding with a collective shrug.With the vast majority of its adult population vaccinated and about nine out of 10 of those 60 and older with a booster, South Korea is pushing ahead with plans to ease social distancing measures, relax border restrictions and learn to live with the virus’s risk, even as it is experiencing some of the highest per-person infection rates anywhere in the world.  “Everyone used to be hush-hush about getting infected, like you were causing a nuisance,” said Lee Soo-won, a bartender who owns two cocktail bars in central Seoul with a long wait-list almost every night. “Now we’re congratulating people on getting super immunity.”He added: “The perception is it’s like getting a cold.”That represents a dramatic shift compared with how South Korea responded to any spike in cases during the first two years of the pandemic.Then, even when the increase in cases paled in comparison with other parts of the world — a couple hundred cases a day, or even a few dozen — the country’s streets emptied out and officials convened emergency meetings to impose curfews or limitations on gatherings.  Throughout the pandemic, the South Korean government has touted its aggressive, and at times invasive, approach to the virus, calling its playbook the “K-quarantine model” and encouraging other countries to follow suit.  Now, the government has said it is moving away from severe restrictions to letting the virus move through the population, in an effort to allow small businesses to recover and normal life to resume.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated March 30, 2022, 2:09 a.m. ETHong Kong is running low on coffins amid its deadliest Covid wave.Americans are taking fewer precautions two years into the pandemic, poll says.Twenty-one states file a lawsuit to block the mask mandate on public transportation.On Friday, officials are set to meet to discuss further relaxing social distancing limitations, under which businesses must close by 11 p.m. and no more than six people can gather indoors. On April 1, the country plans to begin allowing vaccinated travelers to enter without quarantine.“There isn’t the patience any more,” said Jang Young-ook, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy. “There was a degree of exaggerating the virus’s risk involved to get people’s cooperation.” He added: “But that cooperation is a type of resource, and it was squandered and depleted.”The latest surge has barely made a dent in data showing people’s visits to retail stores, when earlier waves in 2020 led to drops by one-third or more, Mr. Jang said.Kim Jin-ah, 28, a Seoul resident who works at a department store, said she wavered between feeling afraid of the virus closing in around her — her father recently tested positive — and resigning herself to the fact that she may get it sooner or later, and that the risk of getting seriously ill was low.On the one hand, she said she feared no longer being able to dine out or travel if the surge led to the government reimposing restrictions. “I’m afraid our daily life might evaporate,” Ms. Kim said.  But she said she also thought that South Korea had prematurely dropped measures against the virus, including vaccine passes. “I worry that things might devolve into a situation that feels like a disaster movie,” she said.  Also on edge are South Korea’s medical professionals, who are concerned the about-face in South Koreans’ attitudes on the virus could result in its hospitals being overwhelmed, especially as more medical workers get infected.Eom Joongsik, an infectious disease specialist at the Gachon University Gil Medical Center in Incheon, said he and his colleagues were bracing themselves for the weeks ahead when the full brunt of the latest surge is expected to hit their emergency rooms and intensive care units. He said that he also worried about the impact on other serious illnesses if the medical system were to be stretched thin. Officials said on Thursday that 65.6 percent of its critical care beds were full.In Mr. Eom’s view, the government’s timing on its new approach to the virus was off.“The decision to relax the measures could have been made after we’re past the peak,” he said.

"Amid Invasion of Ukraine, I.R.S. Aims to Police Oligarch Sanction",2022-03-17 18:07:26+00:00,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service is pressing Congress to devote more resources to the agency as it takes an increasingly central role in the Biden administration’s efforts to prevent Russia and its oligarchs from evading the punishing sanctions that the United States has imposed.Aides to Charles P. Rettig, the I.R.S. commissioner, told congressional staff on Wednesday afternoon that the agency’s criminal investigations unit, which has 3,000 employees, needs to grow about 40 percent over the next five years. It wants a net gain of about 1,300 after attrition. That could require Congress to invest more than $5 billion in the agency, which is trying to oversee a sprawling sanctions program and coping with evasion tactics that have become more sophisticated as a result of the proliferation of digital assets.The Biden administration had already pushed to bolster the I.R.S., including asking Congress to increase its budget by $80 billion over 10 years in an attempt to crack down on tax cheats. That effort has faced resistance from Republicans, who have historically tried to starve the agency of money. The Treasury Department, which oversees the I.R.S., has not previously specified the need for funds for the criminal investigations division.Finding support for more money for the I.R.S. will not be easy. An agency official said Republicans had blocked a request for more criminal investigation funds in the spending bill that Congress passed last week.  In a report circulated among members of Congress that was reviewed by The New York Times, the I.R.S. said it needed additional resources because the criminal investigations team had been asked to assist with interagency efforts to enforce sanctions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The agency asserted that investing in the division would pay off, noting that its current $600 million annual budget allowed it to identify $10.4 billion in tax fraud and financial crimes last year.“Working with law enforcement entities across government, the I.R.S. is already in the process of investigating Russian oligarchs and those who facilitate the illegal movement of money or assets on their behalf,” the report said.The I.R.S. has been involved in more than 20 investigations related to money laundering by oligarchs since 2017, working with other law enforcement agencies to track assets and seize property, the report said.The criminal investigations division of the I.R.S. has a storied history; its agents have helped take down notorious tax cheats such as Pete Rose and Al Capone. Like the rest of the I.R.S., the unit has seen its budget depleted in recent years. The size of its staff declined 25 percent over the last decade.In the last month, its task became much more complicated.The United States has enacted sweeping sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, freezing the assets of its central bank, blocking transactions associated with major financial institutions and targeting top government officials and oligarchs. Experts consider the sanctions to be the most robust ever directed at a major economy, but they are also expected to spur aggressive evasion measures by Russians.  A global game of sanctions cat-and-mouse is now underway. This week, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a Treasury Department bureau, issued a new alert to financial institutions urging them to identify and report suspicious transactions involving real estate, luxury goods and other high-value assets of sanctioned Russian elites and their families. It warned jewelry and art dealers that such assets could be particularly ripe for Russian sanctions evasion.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 30, 2022, 5:42 a.m. ETStrikes continue in the Chernihiv region, despite Russia’s promises.Putin’s war complicates India’s middle path among the global powers.Here are the latest developments in Ukraine.“Because real estate, luxury goods, and other high-value assets can be used as a store of value, a medium of exchange, or an investment, sanctioned Russian elites and their proxies may use such assets to evade expansive U.S. and other sanctions and restrictions imposed in response to the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine,” the network, known as FinCEN, said.The Treasury Department on Wednesday also opened its new Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Program, which offers rewards of up to $5 million for information that leads to the seizure of stolen assets linked to Russia or other foreign governments. And to improve international coordination in targeting Russian assets, the United States unveiled the Multilateral Russian Oligarch Task Force with counterparts from Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Britain and the European Commission.Much of the sanctions enforcement in the United States will be done through the I.R.S. Officials from the agency said they would use financial tracing technology and work with banks and international counterparts to track how oligarchs and others were shifting money and assets around the world in violation of the sanctions. They are looking for signs of newly created fictitious businesses that could be used to shelter assets and transactions involving cryptocurrencies, which criminals use to move money anonymously.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground.

The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.According to the report, the I.R.S. seized $3.6 billion of stolen cryptocurrency last year and has already surpassed that this year.Mr. Rettig made the case personally on Thursday morning when he testified before the House Ways and Means Committee.“A strong, robust criminal tax enforcement presence provides significant deterrence to those willing to evade their lawful obligations to our country,” he said. “Without adequate resources, we risk sending a much less powerful message to would-be and active tax evaders.”  Mr. Rettig also pushed back against proposals from some Republican lawmakers who have recently called for further slashing the agency’s budget. Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, proposed last month to cut the agency’s funding and work force by 50 percent in his new plan to “rescue America.”Mr. Rettig told lawmakers that such an idea would render the agency useless, quipping that “if the I.R.S. budget was cut by 50 percent, you might be better off, and save more money, by just shutting it down completely.” "
A City Under Sieg,2022-03-17 14:26:11.025000+00:00,"Mariupol — in southeastern Ukraine, near the Russian border — has been under siege for more than two weeks. It is the city where Russia last week bombed a maternity hospital and yesterday attacked a theater that hundreds of civilians were using as a shelter. It was unclear how many of those sheltering survived, according to a Ukrainian official.Since the war began, two of the few working journalists in Mariupol have been Mstyslav Chernov and Evgeniy Maloletka of The Associated Press. My colleagues and I were deeply affected by their dispatch, and we’re turning over the lead section of today’s newsletter to an excerpt from it.The bodies of the children all lie here, dumped into this narrow trench hastily dug into the frozen earth of Mariupol to the constant drumbeat of shelling.There’s 18-month-old Kirill, whose shrapnel wound to the head proved too much for his little toddler’s body. There’s 16-year-old Iliya, whose legs were blown up in an explosion during a soccer game at a school field. There’s the girl no older than 6 who wore the pajamas with cartoon unicorns and who was among the first of Mariupol’s children to die from a Russian shell.  They are stacked together with dozens of others in this mass grave on the outskirts of the city. A man covered in a bright blue tarp, weighed down by stones at the crumbling curb. A woman wrapped in a red and gold bedsheet, her legs neatly bound at the ankles with a scrap of white fabric. Workers toss the bodies in as fast as they can, because the less time they spend in the open, the better their own chances of survival.“Damn them all, those people who started this!” raged Volodymyr Bykovskyi, a worker pulling crinkling black body bags from a truck.More bodies will come, from streets where they are everywhere and from the hospital basement where the corpses of adults and children are laid out, awaiting someone to pick them up. The youngest still has an umbilical stump attached.  Each airstrike and shell that relentlessly pounds Mariupol — about one a minute at times — drives home the curse of a geography that has put the city squarely in the path of Russia’s domination of Ukraine. This southern seaport of 430,000 has become a symbol of the drive by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to crush a democratic Ukraine — and also of a fierce resistance on the ground. The city is now encircled by Russian soldiers, who are slowly squeezing the life out of it, one blast at a time.  The surrounding roads are mined and the port blocked. Food is running out, and the Russians have stopped humanitarian attempts to bring it in. Electricity is mostly gone and water is sparse, with residents melting snow to drink. People burn scraps of furniture in makeshift grills to warm their hands in the freezing cold.Some parents have even left their newborns at the hospital, perhaps hoping to give them a chance at life in the one place with decent electricity and water.Death is everywhere. Local officials have tallied more than 2,500 deaths in the siege, but many bodies can’t be counted because of the endless shelling. They have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets because it’s too dangerous to hold funerals.Just weeks ago, Mariupol’s future seemed much brighter. If geography drives a city’s destiny, Mariupol was on the path to success, with its thriving iron and steel plants, a deepwater port and high global demand for both.By Feb. 27, that started to change, as an ambulance raced into a city hospital carrying a small motionless girl, not yet 6. Her brown hair was pulled back off her pale face with a rubber band, and her pajama pants were bloodied by Russian shelling.Her wounded father came with her, his head bandaged. Her mother stood outside the ambulance, weeping.As the doctors and nurses huddled around her, one gave her an injection. Another shocked her with a defibrillator. “Show this to Putin,” one doctor said, with expletive-laced fury. “The eyes of this child and crying doctors.”  They couldn’t save her. Doctors covered the tiny body with her pink striped jacket and gently closed her eyes. She now rests in the mass grave.  This agony fits in with Putin’s goals. The siege is a military tactic popularized in medieval times and designed to crush a population through starvation and violence, allowing an attacking force to spare its own soldiers the cost of entering a hostile city. Instead, civilians are the ones left to die. Serhiy Orlov, the deputy mayor of Mariupol, predicts worse is soon to come. Most of the city remains trapped. “People are dying without water and food, and I think in the next several days we will count hundreds and thousands of deaths.”For more: See more photographs from Mariupol in The A.P.’s full story (which Lori Hinnant, based in Paris, helped write).

UNESCO Will Send Body Armor to Ukrainian Journalist,2022-03-17 09:51:12.484000+00:00,"YEREVAN, Armenia — The United Nations’ cultural agency said on Thursday that it was sending body armor and helmets to Ukraine to help protect Ukrainian journalists, many of whom have gone from covering local news to suddenly becoming war correspondents.At least four journalists, including a Ukrainian, have been killed covering the fighting since Russia began its invasion last month.“Every day, journalists and media workers are risking their lives in Ukraine to provide lifesaving information to local populations and inform us of the reality of this war,” Audrey Azoulay, the director-general of the agency, UNESCO, said in a statement released from Paris.The body armor was part of emergency measures adopted by the agency to protect journalists in Ukraine and help displaced journalists continue their work. A UNESCO diplomat said it was the first time in any conflict that the U.N. agency had sent body armor to journalists.  UNESCO said it would send an initial 125 sets of ballistic vests and helmets to Ukraine, where it noted that thousands of journalists, including many Ukrainians, were without war zone training or protective equipment and unprepared for the risks they were facing.It said it was organizing online courses on hostile-environment and first-aid training and was helping to establish in-person training in Lviv. UNESCO also said it was funding a hotline for journalists who need help evacuating danger zones and helping to relocate the offices of two Ukrainian journalists’ unions to neighboring Poland.On Monday, a Ukrainian journalist and an Irish cameraman were killed in shelling near Kyiv while reporting for Fox News a day after an American filmmaker was fatally shot in a suburb of the capital. Early this month, a Ukrainian television cameraman was among five people killed when Russian forces shelled a television tower in Kyiv. "
"In Some Parts of the World, the War in Ukraine Seems Justified",2022-03-22 21:20:37.461000+00:00,"To an independent filmmaker in Hanoi, Vietnam, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is a “wise leader.” In Rio de Janeiro, a former restaurant owner said he was convinced that Ukraine had hired actors to fake war injuries. And a 27-year-old doctor living near Nairobi in Kenya questioned how Americans could be outraged over the Russian invasion when “for so long, they had a monopoly over anarchy.”Most of the world has loudly and unequivocally condemned Mr. Putin for sparking a war with Ukraine. But in countries where governments have remained neutral, tacitly supported Russia or encouraged the dissemination of false or sanitized accounts of the war, citizens are voicing a much more complicated and forgiving narrative of Mr. Putin’s invasion.Interviews with dozens of people in those countries — from Vietnam to Afghanistan to South Africa to China — reveal that while many are disturbed by the war and the loss of innocent lives, some are sympathetic to Russia’s justifications for its invasion of Ukraine, and do not accept the good versus evil scenario presented by the United States and Europe.Their views are shaped by factors such as their countries’ deep and historic ties to Russia and the history of interventions and atrocities perpetrated by some Western countries — as well as disinformation and censorship that in some places is propagated by the state.  Many found resonance in the argument that Ukraine’s effort to join NATO compromised Russia’s security. Some held on to a nostalgia for the old Soviet Union. Still others could not side with a West that they viewed as hypocritical. These attitudes have helped prime the pump for the flourishing of conspiracy theories about the war.“The U.S. invaded Iraq and no one made the same noise as people are doing against Putin,” said Eni Aquino, 52, a sports commentator from Goiânia in midwestern Brazil.Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has strong ties to Mr. Putin and flew to Moscow right before the invasion, but has taken a position of neutrality on the war. Polls show wide approval for this stance.  Arthur Maia Caetano, 68, said that since shutting down his restaurant in Rio de Janeiro because of the pandemic, he has been using his time to read Russian news websites and bulletins from the 70 or so groups that he follows on the social messaging app Telegram.  “When I started to look carefully at war, I saw that the first to die is the truth,” Mr. Caetano said, citing unfounded claims circulating online, such as that Ukraine has hired actors to pretend they were injured and that it maintains biological weapons laboratories funded by the United States.In China, state media has done much to bolster false stories about what is unfolding in Ukraine.Outlets have republished official Russian propaganda without verification, including false reports that Ukraine had been using civilians as human shields and that President Volodymyr Zelensky had left Kyiv.While Chinese officials have not explicitly endorsed the Kremlin’s actions, they have framed the invasion as a rational decision by Russia to resist aggression from the West, and specifically from the United States.Zhang Han, 37, has been an avid consumer of that messaging. Mr. Zhang, a programmer at a technology company in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, said he was initially shocked by Mr. Putin’s actions. But he said he also empathized with the Russian leader’s desire to absorb Ukraine and pointed to China’s ambition to unify with Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing has long claimed as its own.“Of course, I pity the situation of Ukrainians and hope that the war can end soon,” he said. “But that’s the mind-set of a big country.”In Vietnam, state authorities have also attempted to control the narrative about the war. Two editors for a Vietnamese online magazine and a state broadcaster said they were issued directives on reporting on the war that included reducing the extent and frequency of coverage, and banning the word “invasion.” Both asked to remain anonymous for fear of government reprisals.Vuong Quoc Hung, a 36-year-old stockbroker from Hanoi, said he grew up watching documentaries and films on national television about the Soviet Red Army heroes who battled Nazi Germany during World War II. That made him fall in love with Russia, he said.  “So when Russia attacks Ukraine, people like me will sympathize with Russia, assuming that it is purely Russian self-defense,” he said.  The difficult balance for some, though, is that innocent Ukrainian lives are being lost. That toll is impossible to justify, some said, even if they think that Russia had the right to attack in self-defense.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 30, 2022, 5:42 a.m. ETStrikes continue in the Chernihiv region, despite Russia’s promises.Putin’s war complicates India’s middle path among the global powers.Here are the latest developments in Ukraine.Although Tran Trung Hieu, a 28-year-old independent filmmaker in Hanoi, firmly opposes the atrocities of war, he said his faith in Mr. Putin was unshaken.“I’m quite sure that a wise leader like President Putin must have given a lot of thought before sending troops into Ukraine,” said Mr. Hieu, who was born in Russia.He added that he was “a big fan of ‘Uncle Putin,’ because he always takes drastic actions.”In India, the affinity for Russia is about much more than friendship. India relies on Russia for about half of its arms supplies, and has not spoken out against Russia. Some in India are critical of the United States for fighting wars overseas.  “Wherever they’ve gone, they’ve left it in a mess,” said Naresh Chand, a retired lieutenant general in the Indian Army who trained in Russia and Ukraine.  The devastation of American military intervention remains fresh and painful in Afghanistan, leaving many Afghans angry at the United States and NATO for their failures, and the crushing economic and humanitarian disasters that followed the fall of the Western-backed government last year.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.Nazir Hussani, 34, said he thinks the West will only widen the scope of the war in Ukraine by sending weapons there. And, he said, he doesn’t trust the Americans because of their history in Afghanistan, which they invaded in 2001.“I know they don’t want to share the truth with the media and people,” he said.To some, the West’s position on Ukraine’s war reeks of hypocrisy.Dr. Lucky Muange, who lives in Kiambu County, several miles north of Nairobi, said NATO and Western nations had little right to vilify Mr. Putin when they have in the past invaded and occupied poor countries, or interfered to topple their governments.“So now they are shocked when Russia is the one doing it?” he said.Since the start of the war, the South African government has been adamant about remaining neutral, and repeatedly called for peace. But officials have also gone out of their way to highlight the country’s longstanding friendship with Russia.The Soviet Union was the first major world power to provide direct support for the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. Countries like the United States supported South Africa’s white, racist regime until the 1980s.  The African National Congress, which was in the forefront of the anti-apartheid movement, is South Africa’s governing party. The latest edition of its weekly newsletter includes an article with the headline, “Situation in Ukraine is about denazification of the country by Russia.” The article perpetuates the false claim, promoted by the Russian government, that in 2014 Ukraine’s government “was replaced by ultra-nationals and neo Nazis who were backed by the U.S. and the E.U.”Siyabonga Ntuli, a 28-year-old software developer in Johannesburg, said that Mr. Putin’s claims about Nazis in Ukraine were false propaganda meant to justify the invasion. Still, Mr. Ntuli said, he believed that Mr. Putin did have good reason to go to war with Ukraine, because NATO’s eastward expansion threatened Russia.“It’s a shame that Ukraine is going to end up picking up the bill for it,” he said. “But I think that NATO knew it. I think they wanted to test his resolve.”Mr. Ntuli was chatting with three friends on a sunny afternoon in Gandhi Square in downtown Johannesburg, where they regularly meet to discuss life and current events.Zamani Msimango, also 28 and a software developer, likened the current situation to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when the United States threatened to invade Cuba after the Soviet Union placed nuclear-armed missiles there.“But somehow now they act like they don’t understand, when they themselves are pushing closer and closer to Russia, what that’s going to lead to,” Mr. Msimango said.Thandiswa Bonani, a 40-year-old fashion designer in Johannesburg, said she believed that Mr. Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, was “manipulating other countries to feel sorry for him.”  “Putin, he didn’t just invade Ukraine,” she said. “There’s something there. I might not be able to put it in words, but there is something there.”John Eligon reported from Johannesburg, South Africa.

ur Thursday Briefing,2022-03-18 10:45:46.107000+00:00,"Russian forces batter UkraineRussian forces destroyed a theater in the coastal Ukrainian city of Mariupol where about 1,000 people had been sheltering yesterday, in a day of intensifying brutality. At least 10 people were killed by shelling in Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, as they waited in line for bread. Russia’s Defense Ministry denied carrying out the attack on Mariupol. Follow the latest updates.Three weeks into the war in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, made an impassioned appeal to the U.S. Congress, casting the defense of his nation as a battle for democracy. As he spoke, his country’s forces staged counterattacks near Kyiv and the Russian-occupied city of Kherson as battle-depleted Russian troops continued their attempt to encircle major cities.President Biden, responding to Zelensky, said the U.S. would send Ukraine an additional $800 million in security aid, including antiaircraft and antitank missiles. Biden has sharpened his rhetoric regarding Russia’s leader, describing Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, as “a war criminal.” But he did not agree to more direct military intervention, including the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Ukraine.The Interpreter: As Russia digs in, what’s the risk of nuclear war? “It’s not zero,” one nuclear strategist said.  Other news from the war:Putin referred to Russians who support the West as “scum and traitors” who needed to be removed from society.NATO’s ministers will discuss enhancing defenses along the eastern front as Russia presses closer.Olga Smirnova, a star ballerina of the Bolshoi, left Russia in protest and joined the Dutch National Ballet.More than 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in less than three weeks of fighting, according to conservative U.S. estimates.  Mass graves identified in SyriaTwo mass graves have been located near Damascus, Syria. They are believed to hold thousands of bodies of Syrians killed in detention centers run by Bashar al-Assad’s government during the civil war.Interviews over the past several months with four Syrian men who worked at or near secret mass graves led to an examination of satellite images, which in turn revealed the locations of the two sites. The sites could also contain powerful evidence of war crimes committed by al-Assad’s forces, including the systematic torture and the killing of detainees.Throughout Syria’s 11-year civil war, more than 144,000 people disappeared into government detention centers. Many of them are presumed dead. The U.S. Treasury Department said last year that at least 14,000 had been tortured to death, but the actual number is almost certainly much higher.  Quotable: “If the issue of the missing and the disappeared is not resolved, there can never be peace in Syria,” said Diab Serrih, a co-founder of an association of former detainees in Syria’s notorious Saydnaya prison who has worked to locate mass graves. Families call, he said, saying, “‘I just want to see a grave so that I can put a flower on it.’”  Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is freed after six yearsNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian charity worker who was arrested in Tehran’s airport in 2016 while on her way home to London, will finally be reunited with her husband and daughter after six years of separation, first in prison and then under house arrest.Her release, and that of another British-Iranian citizen, Anoosheh Ashoori, comes after the settlement of a longstanding British debt to Iran that had roiled relations between the two countries, according to Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss. Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe arrived in Oxfordshire early this morning after a flight from Tehran.Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case has drawn considerable media attention in part because of her family’s efforts to publicize it. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, dedicated the past six years to public advocacy for his wife, staging multiple hunger strikes in front of the Iranian Embassy in London.Allegations: Zaghari-Ratcliffe was charged with plotting to overthrow the Iranian government and was eventually sentenced to five years in prison. Though Boris Johnson, then the British foreign secretary, told lawmakers in 2017 that she was “teaching people journalism,” her employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said she was on vacation at the time of her detention.

U.S. Adds ‘Kamikaze Drones’ as More Weapons Flow to Ukrain,2022-03-17 01:58:44+00:00,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will provide Ukraine with additional high-tech defensive weapons that are easily portable and require little training to use against Russian tanks, armored vehicles and aircraft, according to U.S. and European officials.In remarks on Wednesday, President Biden announced $800 million in new military aid for Ukraine, including 800 additional Stinger antiaircraft missiles, 9,000 antitank weapons, 100 tactical drones and a range of small arms including machine guns and grenade launchers.The Ukrainians have already proved their prowess at using British-provided and American-made antitank weaponry against Russia’s much larger military. But in an impassioned speech to Congress on Wednesday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine asked for additional help as Russian troops pushed to encircle major cities.U.S. and European officials want to send more equipment that is easy to use by small teams, and that has technology that can overcome Russian defenses or exploit weaknesses — rather than offensive weapons like tanks and warplanes that require significant logistical support. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the details of the weapons transfer publicly.  In addition to sending its own equipment, the United States is helping coordinate donations from European countries. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III is visiting Slovakia and Bulgaria this week in part to help with that effort.Speaking to reporters Wednesday, a senior defense official said that the United States was focusing on sending supplies quickly, and that the Pentagon would figure out how to replenish its stockpiles later. The official said the focus now was to make sure that the Ukrainians get the items quickly. The Ukrainian military needs easy-to-carry and easy-to-use defensive weapons to continue to stall the Russian advance. The Ukrainians will succeed, U.S. and European military experts said, if they can operate in small teams, strike assembled Russian forces, then melt away to set a new ambush later.As part of the package, the Biden administration will provide Switchblade drones, according to people briefed on the plans. Military officials call the weapon, which is carried in a backpack, the “kamikaze drone” because it can be flown directly at a tank or a group of troops, and is destroyed when it hits the target and explodes.“These were designed for U.S. Special Operations Command and are exactly the type of weapons systems that can have an immediate impact on the battlefield,” said Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense.Bigger, armed drones, like U.S.-made Predators or Reapers, would be difficult for Ukrainians to fly and would be easily destroyed by Russian fighter planes. But former officials said small, portable kamikaze drones could prove to be a cost-effective way to destroy Russian armored convoys.  The United States and its allies are trying to step up the flow of defensive weaponry to the Ukrainians and help them communicate more effectively by providing more gear.The United States has said it has provided some communications gear — and Ukraine has said it wants more, including more tactical radios and jamming gear to help prevent Russian forces from talking to one another.Ukraine had asked for additional MIG fighter planes but has backed off that request. American and European officials have said Ukraine’s military is not flying all the planes it has.Ukrainian officials, including Mr. Zelensky in his speech to Congress, emphasized their need for other equipment, an implicit acknowledgment that the war has moved to a new stage.  In addition to antiaircraft systems like the Stinger, Ukraine is requesting mobile air defense systems that can hit planes flying at higher altitudes, like the bombers that struck a training ground near the Polish border on Sunday.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral.

The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.Mr. Zelensky asked for the S-300, a Russian-made air defense system, which the United States could ask other nations to provide.  Mr. Austin will be talking with allies in Europe about ways they can give Ukraine additional air defense equipment, the senior defense official said.The United States and its allies have already been providing ammunition for NATO-standard weapons and for those that were used by the former Soviet Union. While Ukraine has been modernizing its military, its state-owned defense industry continues to make weaponry modeled on Soviet-era designs, such as Kalashnikov assault rifles. The new U.S. package will include small arms like rifles, pistols, machine guns and grenade launchers in both Eastern and Western standard calibers.The American Javelin and Britain’s NLAW antitank missiles take just hours to learn how to use and have proved effective in the hands of Ukraine’s military, officials said.The Ukrainians have been able to destroy so many Russian tanks and armored vehicles in large measure because they have good conceptual plans of how to use the antitank missiles and the bravery to employ them up close in battle, a British diplomat said in an interview on Wednesday.The Ukrainians, the official said, “are fighting against an existential threat and they aren’t giving up. They have the will.” "
Biden Calls Putin ‘War Criminal’ in Verbal Escalation With Russia,2022-03-17 12:25:51.357000+00:00,"The rhetorical clash between the United States and Russia escalated on Wednesday when President Biden said that he believed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a “war criminal,” and a top Russian official said the comment was “unacceptable and unforgivable.”Mr. Biden was responding to a reporter’s question as he was leaving an event at the White House. Later, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters that Mr. Biden was “speaking from his heart and speaking from what he’s seen on television.”In the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, there have been attacks on refugee escape routes, heavily populated civilian neighborhoods, schools, hospitals and, on Wednesday, a theater that was being used as a bomb shelter.On Wednesday, an International Criminal Court prosecutor, Karim Khan, held a virtual meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky while in Ukraine. Late last month, Mr. Khan said he was seeking authorization to open an investigation into the war, and that his office had already found “a reasonable basis” to believe war crimes had been committed. He said it “had identified potential cases that would be admissible.”  The Kremlin responded to Mr. Biden’s comment on Wednesday with a longstanding critique that it was Western countries, rather than Russia, who were threatening world peace.Dmitri Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, told the state-run news outlet Tass that Mr. Biden’s remarks were “unacceptable and unforgivable on the part of the head of a state, whose bombs have killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world.”Last month, Mr. Putin spoke to reporters in his country about “the fundamental threats which irresponsible Western politicians created for Russia consistently rudely and unceremoniously from year to year.”Mr. Biden’s unscripted remarks on Wednesday echo messages U.S. officials have been making recently.Vice President Kamala Harris was in Warsaw on March 10, a day after an apparent Russian strike destroyed a maternity ward in Mariupol. Would the United States support an investigation into accusations Russia committed war crimes, a reporter asked Ms. Harris.“Absolutely,” Ms. Harris said, though she did not directly accuse Russia of committing war crimes.Later that same day, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the BBC NewsHour that Russia’s attacks on civilians “constitute war crimes; there are attacks on civilians that cannot be justified by any — in any way whatsoever.”  Mr. Biden has long criticized Mr. Putin, including in a television interview with ABC News that was broadcast last year. In the interview, when Mr. Biden was asked whether he thought Mr. Putin was a “killer,” he responded, “Mmm hmm, I do.”The Kremlin recalled its ambassador to Washington after those remarks aired, and Mr. Putin quoted a Russian schoolyard rhyme in response, saying, “When I was a child, when we argued in the courtyard, we said the following: ‘If you call someone names, that’s really your name.’” "
"Zelensky Pleads for More U.S. Aid, Invoking America’s Darkest Day",2022-03-17 16:18:24.224000+00:00,"WASHINGTON — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine invoked the memory of America’s darkest days on Wednesday as he pleaded for more military aid to combat Russia’s “inhumane destruction” of his country, directly challenging President Biden and members of Congress to help by showing a wrenching video of the carnage in Ukraine’s cities.Appearing before Congress by video link from Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky likened Russia’s three-week onslaught in Ukraine to Japan’s World War II air assault on Pearl Harbor, when “your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” and to Sept. 11, when “innocent people were attacked, attacked from the air.” Dressed in an olive green T-shirt and seated next to a Ukrainian flag, he urged the United States and its allies to fulfill a moral duty by imposing a no-fly zone over his country to prevent Russian attacks from the air.“I call on you to do more,” Mr. Zelensky said, describing the conflict raging in Ukraine as an assault on the world’s civilized nations. Speaking directly to Mr. Biden, he added: “I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.”  The appeal and the explicit video of people wounded and killed by Russian attacks left some lawmakers in tears and brought members in both parties to their feet in lengthy standing ovations for the wartime leader. In his own remarks a few hours later, Mr. Biden praised Mr. Zelensky for demonstrating “remarkable courage and strength in the face of brutal aggression” and announced that the United States would soon deliver $800 million worth of antiaircraft and anti-armor missiles, grenades, rifles, body armor and more.  Mr. Zelensky’s appeals in recent weeks, capped by his emotional speech on Wednesday, have helped spur bipartisan action from Mr. Biden and members of Congress, including a nearly $14 billion aid package that includes help for refugees, economic assistance and billions of dollars in military aid. Mr. Biden signed that legislation on Tuesday.But while Mr. Zelensky has steadily increased the pressure by tapping into a public sense of anger and grief about the consequences of Russia’s invasion, he has failed to persuade Mr. Biden and most lawmakers to support his most pressing demands for help — access to fighter jets and efforts to close off the skies above his country.Mr. Biden and his top military aides have rejected requests to help Ukraine acquire aging Russian-made MIG fighters from Poland. American officials said the Pentagon had assessed that they would do little good in Ukraine’s fight against Russia — and might be used by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as an excuse to widen the fighting to neighboring countries in Europe.Mr. Zelensky’s speech did little to immediately shake the resolve of the United States and its allies to avoid direct military confrontation with Russia, which leaders of NATO countries believe could lead to a catastrophic global war with devastating consequences.  In Brussels, NATO officials again categorically rejected the idea of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying it would require the kind of military conflict with Russia that they are seeking to avoid. In Washington, Mr. Biden made no mention of a no-fly zone even as he pledged to send more military aid.“The American people are answering President Zelensky’s call for more help, more weapons for Ukraine,” Mr. Biden said. He also vowed to help Ukraine acquire long-distance antiaircraft systems and munitions that could help defend the country’s cities against Russian fighters and bombers.“Putin is inflicting appalling, appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine,” Mr. Biden said. “Bombing apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals. I mean, it’s God-awful.”Asked a question as he departed an event later in the day, Mr. Biden said of Mr. Putin: “I think he is a war criminal.” It was the first time the administration had specifically accused the Russian president of war crimes over the invasion of Ukraine.Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Biden delivered their speeches against the backdrop of more grim developments in Ukraine, including shelling in Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv on Wednesday.Ahead of Mr. Biden’s eight-minute speech, Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, warned his Russian counterpart against “any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine,” the White House said in a statement.The warning to Nikolai P. Patrushev, Mr. Putin’s main national security adviser, reflected escalating concerns in Washington that the Russians, stymied in their hopes of a quick takeover of the country, could resort to using weapons of mass destruction.  In his address to Congress, Mr. Zelensky appealed to both lawmakers’ emotions and their belief in the United States as the leader of the free world. He thanked lawmakers for their support but sternly suggested that the United States had yet to fulfill the nation’s purported moral duty to help defend democracies terrorized by violent authoritarians — including democracies that are outside its alliances.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 29, 2022, 6:15 p.m. ETRussia says it’s pulling back from Kyiv. These soldiers say they’re still ready to fight.Peace talks produce signs of progress, but no end to war is in sight.Pentagon casts doubt on Russia’s claim to be pulling back troops near Kyiv.He borrowed a phrase from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — “I have a dream” — as he urged the United States to help him fight Russia’s aircraft, saying “I have a need” to protect the sky from Russian attacks.“I see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths,” Mr. Zelensky said, speaking in English during the end of his speech.Mr. Zelensky delivered his address through an interpreter to a packed movie-theater-style auditorium in the Capitol complex, calling it “the darkest time for our country” as he asked lawmakers to watch images of Ukraine before and after the Russian invasion. Such explicit scenes of wreckage have rarely, if ever, been shown to lawmakers in an address delivered by a foreign dignitary, and the effect was immediately palpable.Sitting rapt in their seats during the address, many members of Congress could be seen wiping away tears from their faces as they watched scenes of a Ukraine in shambles. Mr. Zelensky’s defiance in the face of the unrelenting Russian assault has inspired lawmakers in both parties, who have been eager to send him aid.  Many lawmakers have pressed Mr. Biden to do more to help Ukraine and punish Russia, often on a quicker timeline than the administration has desired. In his remarks, Mr. Zelensky appeared to play up that dynamic, as he simultaneously praised Mr. Biden’s help but said it had fallen short.  “A few minutes ago, President Zelensky reminded us that the United States is indeed the leader of the free world,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, said in a speech from the Senate floor. “So it’s time we acted like it.”Congress last week approved the nearly $14 billion aid package for Ukraine, more than doubling the Biden administration’s original price tag in an unusually swift and bipartisan display. But faced with Mr. Zelensky’s emotional descriptions of a terrorized nation, lawmakers on Wednesday emerged from his presentation showing no qualms about sending him even more aid, in what is likely to become a messy debate that splinters along party lines.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.While members of Congress generally agree that the United States should send more weaponry to Ukraine, deep disagreements remain over what exactly would be appropriate to provide.Some of Mr. Zelensky’s requests, such as the imposition of a no-fly zone, have been ruled out by the Biden administration and NATO allies. Others are being more seriously considered by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, including providing Ukraine with advanced antimissile systems and drones.And several lawmakers in both parties continue to call for the United States to help transfer MIG fighter jets to Ukraine, despite questions about whether the country’s air force could even fly the planes and whether Russia would view the transfer as an escalatory move.“They need more Javelins, they need more ammo, they need more Stingers, they need more surface-to-air missiles, they need more airplanes, they need more of everything,” said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, referring to Javelin antitank missiles and Stinger antiaircraft missiles.“Zelensky has the courage of his convictions,” Mr. Sasse added. “The question he asked the Congress and the United States government is: Will we have the courage of ours? We’re a superpower. We should act like it.”  With many in Congress calling for the White House to get behind the transfer of the MIG fighters to Ukraine from Poland, the White House pushed back again.Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that because the planes would take off from NATO air bases, those bases could become targets for Russian retaliation, potentially drawing NATO forces into the war. On Wednesday, she built on that argument, saying that because the jets were capable of making it to Russia to conduct an attack, they could be considered offensive weapons.The Biden administration insists that the long-range antiaircraft systems being transferred to Ukraine are entirely defensive in nature. But it is not clear that the Russians would regard them as such, since both the antiaircraft systems and the MIG fighters could take down Russian planes. In private, some administration officials concede that the distinction is a narrow one and that it is not clear that the Russians would consider antiaircraft batteries as defensive.Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said Mr. Zelensky made “an incredibly compelling case that Putin will only stop when we stop him.” But he added a note of restraint, giving voice to a calculation that top administration officials have privately weighed.“It really is just a fundamental question of how much risk are we willing to take,” Mr. Coons said.The public and often partisan debate over which weapons to send to Ukraine has clearly annoyed some Biden allies. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said the public discussion was reaching the point of absurdity.“For us to be telegraphing to Russia every single day our divisions over what kind of defensive support Ukraine should get, and telegraphing to them exactly what weapon systems we’re transferring, I don’t know is helpful,” Mr. Murphy said. “This is a strange way to prosecute a war.”  Despite the divisions among lawmakers, Mr. Biden sought to make clear that the United States was united in its support of Ukraine.“Let there be no doubt, no uncertainty, no question,” he said. “America stands with the forces of freedom. We always have, we always will.”Jonathan Weisman, Emily Cochrane and David E. Sanger contributed reporting. "
Powerful Quake Off Japan Rekindles Fears of Another Fukushima,2022-03-17 06:45:20+00:00,"TOKYO — A powerful undersea earthquake off the Fukushima region of Japan, where a tsunami a decade ago set off one of the worst nuclear plant disasters in history, shook buildings for more than two minutes late Wednesday night.Then the waiting began.Shortly after the quake hit at 11:36 p.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency issued tsunami warnings for the prefectures of Fukushima and Miyagi, and thousands of residents, many of whom remember only too well the destruction of 2011, evacuated.“Please put out any fires,” officials in the city of Minamisoma, in Fukushima, told residents as they urged them to get to safer ground. “Please listen to the TV and radio and act calmly and accordingly.”Hours later, the warnings were lifted.Several small tsunami waves measuring perhaps 20 centimeters in height (eight inches) were reported in two communities, but they were one-fifth the size that was forecast — and tiny compared to the 45-foot wave that devastated the region in 2011. More than 19,000 people died in that catastrophe.  “In a lot of areas, there was a lot of stuff thrown everywhere, like files and everything,” said Shelly Reid, a staff member at Minamisoma City Hall. “Some roads were damaged, especially along the coast. There were some landslides.”At least three people were confirmed dead after Wednesday’s quake, with more than 190 injured.The earthquake measured magnitude 7.4 — strong enough to do serious structural damage — but the magnitude 9 Tohoku quake that caused the catastrophic 2011 tsunami was hundreds of times as powerful. The epicenter of the earthquake on Wednesday was 20 miles off the east coast of Japan, and about 35 miles below the sea.  “We usually don’t see a destructive tsunami until you get to around 7.5,” said Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.But the damage reports were still coming in early Thursday morning, and the quake, which could be felt in Tokyo, almost 200 miles away, did more than just rattle nerves in a country where many wait for the earth beneath their feet to move again at any moment.  Two million people were left without power, if only briefly, and fire departments were called to rescue passengers trapped in elevators. A bullet train carrying about 100 people between the Fukushima and Shiroshizaou stations derailed, although there were no reports of injuries. And passengers on subway trains posted videos of cars swaying precariously as they made their way through tunnels.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the country’s Self-Defense Forces had been mobilized to assess the damage.“We are still trying to understand the situation and collect information,” he said at a news briefing. “The government will come together to save people’s lives and to make all-out efforts to provide safety and provide accurate information.”The intensity of the earthquake equaled that of the Kobe earthquake of 1995, which killed more than 6,000 people. The difference was its depth below the sea.  Many Japanese noted that the quake occurred just five days after the country observed the 11th anniversary of the Fukushima disaster.“Another big earthquake in Tohoku,” Aiko Sawada, a retired medical researcher, wrote on Twitter. “And so soon after the anniversary of 3.11. I pray that the damage stays minimal.”  After the earthquake in 2011, one of the most powerful ever measured, tsunami waves breached the protective sea walls of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and inundated the facility, leading to the meltdown of three reactors.On Thursday, Japanese officials set out to inspect nuclear plants in the region soon after the quake hit. They said they had detected no abnormalities at plants in Fukushima; in Onagawa in Miyagi Prefecture; or in Tokai in Ibaraki Prefecture.The Tokyo Electric Power Company did say that a fire alarm had gone off at one of the reactors at the defunct Fukushima Daiichi plant. The plant has been undergoing an enormous cleanup since the disaster 11 years ago.And water pumps for spent fuel cooling pools at a separate power plant in Fukushima were down early Thursday, but Tokyo Electric said there was still water in the pools for now, and that both pumps had returned to operation before 2 a.m., according to NHK, the public broadcaster.The tsunami that crippled that plant left Japan with a formidable challenge: How does a quake- and tsunami-prone island nation dotted with nuclear reactors protect against another calamity?  To quell lingering fears, Japanese nuclear regulators in recent years have ordered a flurry of new safety measures at the nation’s reactors, including new sea walls, flood gates and protection for the vital backup generators that power the pumps that cool the hot reactor cores.  But the task is considerable, and deep distrust of nuclear power persists among many Japanese.At the Hamaoka nuclear power plant, for example, which is perched on the Pacific coast west of Tokyo, workers built a 72-foot sea wall, among the tallest in the country, to protect its three reactors. Then came the bad news: Scientists working on new projections of potential tsunamis in the region warned last year that waves could reach almost 74 feet.Hamaoka remains shuttered, as do many of Japan’s other reactors.A decade later, nuclear power, which once provided about a third of Japan’s electricity, now accounts for only a few percent. Thirty-three reactors are capable of generating power — but just five are doing so. The rest are either undergoing inspections or awaiting approval to restart.Motoko Rich reported from Tokyo, and Eric Nagourney from New York.

"As Russian Troop Deaths Climb, Morale May Be an Issu",2022-03-16 22:43:48+00:00,"WASHINGTON — In 36 days of fighting on Iwo Jima during World War II, nearly 7,000 Marines were killed. Now, 20 days after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia invaded Ukraine, his military has already lost more soldiers, according to American intelligence estimates.The conservative side of the estimate, at more than 7,000 Russian troop deaths, is greater than the number of American troops killed over 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.It is a staggering number amassed in just three weeks of fighting, American officials say, with implications for the combat effectiveness of Russian units, including soldiers in tank formations. Pentagon officials say a 10 percent casualty rate, including dead and wounded, for a single unit renders it unable to carry out combat-related tasks.With more than 150,000 Russian troops now involved in the war in Ukraine, Russian casualties, when including the estimated 14,000 to 21,000 injured, are near that level. And the Russian military has also lost at least three generals in the fight, according to Ukrainian, NATO and Russian officials.  Pentagon officials say that a high, and rising, number of war dead can destroy the will to continue fighting. The result, they say, has shown up in intelligence reports that senior officials in the Biden administration read every day: One recent report focused on low morale among Russian troops and described soldiers just parking their vehicles and walking off into the woods.The American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters, caution that their numbers of Russian troop deaths are inexact, compiled through analysis of the news media, Ukrainian figures (which tend to be high, with the latest at 13,500), Russian figures (which tend to be low, with the latest at 498), satellite imagery and careful perusal of video images of Russian tanks and troops that come under fire.American military and intelligence officials know, for instance, how many troops are usually in a tank, and can extrapolate from that the number of casualties when an armored vehicle is hit by, say, a Javelin anti-tank missile.The high rate of casualties goes far to explain why Russia’s much-vaunted force has remained largely stalled outside of Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital.“Losses like this affect morale and unit cohesion, especially since these soldiers don’t understand why they’re fighting,” said Evelyn Farkas, the top Pentagon official for Russia and Ukraine during the Obama administration. “Your overall situational awareness decreases. Someone’s got to drive, someone’s got to shoot.”  But, she added, “that’s just the land forces.” With Russian ground forces in disarray, Mr. Putin has increasingly looked to the skies to attack Ukrainian cities, residential buildings, hospitals and even schools. That aerial bombardment, officials say, has helped camouflage the Russian military’s poor performance on the ground. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said this week that an estimated 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the war.Signs of Russia’s challenges abound. Late last week, Russian news sources reported that Mr. Putin had put two of his top intelligence officials under house arrest. The officials, who run the Fifth Service of Russia’s main intelligence service, the FSB, were interrogated for providing poor intelligence ahead of the invasion, according to Andrei Soldatov, a Russian security services expert.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 29, 2022, 9:59 p.m. ETThe chief of the U.N. food agency warns of a crisis not seen since World War II.Outside Kyiv, a battleground is lost, and then reclaimed.A NASA astronaut will soon fly home to Earth in a Russian spacecraft. Here’s how to watch.“They were in charge of providing political intelligence and cultivating networks of support in Ukraine,” Mr. Soldatov said in an interview. “They told Putin what he wanted to hear” about how the invasion would progress.Russians themselves may be hearing only what Mr. Putin wants them to hear about his “operation” in Ukraine, which he refuses to call a war or an invasion. Since it began, he has exerted iron control over the news outlets in Russia; state media is not publicizing most casualties, and has minimized the destruction.  But some Russians have access to virtual private networks (VPNs) and are able to get news from the West.“I don’t believe he can wall off, indefinitely, Russians from the truth,” William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, told the Senate last Thursday. “Especially as realities began to puncture that bubble, the realities of killed and wounded coming home, and the increasing number, the realities of the economic consequences for ordinary Russians, the realities of the horrific scenes of hospitals and schools being bombed next door in Ukraine, and of civilian casualties there as well.”  The news of the generals’ deaths is trickling out, first from Ukrainians, then confirmed by NATO officials, with one death acknowledged by Mr. Putin in a speech. They have been identified as Maj. Gen. Andrei Kolesnikov, a commander from Russia’s eastern military district; Maj. Gen. Vitaly Gerasimov, first deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army; and Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks.

The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.Western officials say that around 20 Russian generals were in Ukraine as part of the war effort, and that they may have pushed closer to the front to boost morale.“Three generals already — that’s a shocking number,” Michael McFaul, the former United States ambassador to Russia, said in an interview.On Wednesday, Ukrainian officials reported that a fourth general, Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev, the commander of the 150th motorized rifle division, had been killed in fighting.Two American military officials said that many Russian generals are talking on unsecured phones and radios. In at least one instance, they said, the Ukrainians intercepted a general’s call, geolocated it, and attacked his location, killing him and his staff.If Russian military deaths continue to rise, the kinds of civic organizations that called attention to troop deaths and injuries during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan could once more come to prominence.But the Russian toll, some military specialists and lawmakers say, is unlikely to change Mr. Putin’s strategy.  “It is stunning, and the Russians haven’t even gotten to the worst of it, when they hit urban combat in the cities,” Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence committees, said in an interview.“I don’t think it’ll have an impact on Putin’s calculus,” Mr. Crow said. “He is not willing to lose. He’s been backed into a corner and will continue to throw troops at the problem.” "
Spain Seizes Another Russian Yacht Believed to Belong to an Oligarc,2022-03-16 22:02:40+00:00,"MADRID — Spain, which has pledged to seize the suspected superyachts of Russian oligarchs targeted for sanctions imposed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on Wednesday impounded the third such vessel, one of the world’s biggest superyachts, in Spanish territorial waters this week.The ship was impounded in the Spanish port of Tarragona, pending an inspection to establish its exact ownership, Spain’s transport ministry said in a statement. The ship, called the Crescent, was registered in the Cayman Islands.The Spanish authorities have taken similar measures against two other yachts, the Valerie, which was in a maintenance yard in Barcelona, and Lady Anastasia, a yacht that was moored in Port Adriano, on the Spanish island of Majorca.Spain’s hunt for Russian-owned superyachts comes after Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced the seizure of the Valerie on Monday and warned that “there will be more.”   The transport ministry said on Wednesday that if the inspections confirmed that the yachts belonged to people on the sanctions list drawn up by the European Union, they would remain fully immobilized.The Valerie is suspected of being indirectly owned by Sergei Chemezov, the head of Rostec, a Russian industrial conglomerate that also makes military technology and equipment. The vessel was one of four Russian-owned superyachts that had recently been undergoing work at MB92, a shipyard that has helped establish Barcelona as one of the main hubs for the extravagant yachts owned by the super wealthy.The Crescent, valued by the SuperYachtFan website at $600 million, appears to be the sister ship of the slightly larger, slightly more expensive Scheherazade, a 459-foot superyacht that U.S. officials said could be associated with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Both were built at the same German shipyard, Lurssen, where the Crescent was given the project name “Thunder,” while the Scheherazade, put into service about two years later, was called “Lightning.” Both share the same interior and exterior designers and have been managed by a Monaco company, Imperial Yachts, which caters to Russian oligarchs. The two yachts also share another, unusual characteristic: Photos of the Crescent taken on March 13 by a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, Alex Finley, in the Spanish port where it was impounded appear to show that the Crescent conceals its nameplate while in port, just like the Scheherazade.  Track information on the Crescent from MarineTraffic, a maritime data provider, shows that Crescent spends most of its time in the Mediterranean, cruising between Spain, Italy, France and Montenegro, a popular destination for the yachts of Russian oligarchs. The 445-foot long Crescent, one of the 20 largest superyachts, has been at the Tarragona marina since early November.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks.

In late February, the police on Majorca detained a Ukrainian member of the yacht’s crew because he had been planning to sink the vessel, in retaliation for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He was released on bail, pending an investigation.In early March, the French authorities seized a yacht in a yard in La Ciotat, which they said was linked to Igor Sechin, the chief executive of the state oil company Rosneft and a former deputy prime minister of Russia. The French yard is owned by MB92, the Spanish company that owns the yard in Barcelona.MB92 said at the time that it was cooperating with the French authorities and would respond in due course to any possible further sanctions against Russians. “We are continuously monitoring the decisions taken by the Spanish authorities, the European Union and the U.S. as they come into effect,” the company said.

anscript: Zelensky’s Speech to Cong,2022-03-17 00:29:21+00:00,"WASHINGTON — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made an urgent and searing appeal to Congress on Wednesday to come to his country’s aid as it fights off a devastating Russian invasion, casting the war as a battle for the cause of democracy itself.Using stark, often stern language, Mr. Zelensky delivered a remarkably direct call to action by a wartime leader, as he made the case that aiding Ukraine was a moral imperative for a country that has promoted itself as the beacon of freedom and democracy for the world.Mr. Zelensky mostly spoke through an interpreter as he addressed lawmakers on a large screen in a movie theater-style auditorium under the Capitol. Wearing his standard military-issue green T-shirt and seated next to a Ukrainian flag, he briefly stopped his remarks to show lawmakers a graphic and wrenching video featuring images of his war-torn country, including bombs exploding in cities, and civilians, including young children, bloodied and killed by Russian attacks.Here is a transcript of Mr. Zelensky’s remarks, with additional context on key passages:Glory to heroes. Thank you very much. Madam Speaker, members of the Congress, ladies and gentlemen, Americans, friends, I am proud to greet you from Ukraine, from our capital city of Kyiv, a city that is under missile and airstrikes from Russian troops every day. But it doesn’t give up, and we have not even thought about it for a second, just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country, which found themselves in the worst war since World War II.  I have the honor to greet you on behalf of the Ukrainian people, brave and freedom-loving people who, for eight years, have been resisting the Russian aggression, those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this full-scale Russian invasion. Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided, the destiny of our people, whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be able to preserve their democracy.Russia has attacked not just us, not just our land, not just our cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our values, basic human values. It threw tanks and planes against our freedom, against our right to live freely in our own country, choosing our own future, against our desire for happiness, against our national dreams, just like the same dreams you have, you Americans.Just like anyone else in the United States, I remember your national memorial in Rushmore, the faces of your prominent presidents, those who laid the foundation of the United States of America as it is today: democracy, independence, freedom, and care for everyone, for every person, for everyone who works diligently, who lives honestly, who respects the law. We in Ukraine want the same for our people, all that is normal part of your own life.Zelensky invoked American traumas to bolster his caseLadies and gentlemen, friends, Americans, in your great history, you have pages that would allow you to understand Ukrainians, understand us now when we need you, right now. Remember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of Dec. 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember it. Remember September the 11th, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories, in battlefields, when innocent people were attacked, attacked from air, yes. Just like no one else expected it, you could not stop it.Mr. Zelensky sought to place his country’s moment of peril in historical context for members of Congress by recalling two events that are seared in the American consciousness, drawing specific parallels to times the United States was assaulted by air, as Ukraine is now. It is a strategy that he has turned to often in recent weeks as he works to rally support for his cause amid the Russian onslaught.When Mr. Zelensky spoke before Britain’s House of Commons last week, he invoked Winston Churchill, likening the Russian attacks on Ukraine to England’s “darkest hour” during World War II.  The comparisons are aimed at illustrating the stakes of the conflict for Ukraine, and to persuade policymakers around the globe that they should regard it as among the gravest challenges that the world has faced.Our country experience the same every day., Right now at this moment, every night for three weeks now, various Ukrainian cities, Odessa and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, Zhytomyr and Lviv, Mariupol and Dnipro, Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired nearly 1,000 missiles at Ukraine, countless bombs. They use drones to kill us with precision.This is a terror that Europe has not seen, has not seen for 80 years, and we are asking for a reply, for an answer to this terror from the whole world. Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask, humanitarian no-fly zone, something that Russia would not be able to terrorize our free cities? If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative.‘I have a dream.’ A freighted request for a no-fly zone.You know what kind of defense systems we need, S-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield, on the ability to use aircraft, powerful, strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land, aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe. And you know that they exist and you have them, but they are on earth, not in the Ukrainian sky. They do not defend our people. I have a dream. These words are known to each of you today. I can say I have a need. I need to protect our sky. I need your decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words, ‘I have a dream.’A key request that Mr. Zelensky has brought up repeatedly is for American support to close the skies over Ukraine. He has also pleaded with NATO allies to impose a no-fly zone — a move the allies have said would essentially begin World War III — but has been rebuffed.In the speech, he grounded his plea for such measures in the language of the American civil rights movement and a famous speech by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., effectively comparing his struggle to protect his nation to the fight for racial justice in the United States.Knowing that America would not answer that particular call, Mr. Zelensky instead pivoted, asking for powerful antimissile defense systems, such as the S-300. Ukrainian officials have also requested armed drones and communication equipment, which the United States has not yet provided. Washington has sent other arms to Kyiv, including antiaircraft Stinger missiles and antitank Javelin missiles. The Biden administration earlier this month sent a $350 million package of arms and equipment to Ukraine, and on Wednesday, it announced an additional $800 million tranche.Mr. Zelensky has previously requested that the United States help facilitate the transfer of Polish MIG fighter planes, but noticeably did not name them on Wednesday, after the Biden administration rejected the request.  Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support, for everything that your government and your people have done for us, for weapons and ammunition, for training, for finances, for leadership in the free world, which helps us to pressure the aggressor economically.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 30, 2022, 2:52 a.m. ETPutin’s war complicates India’s middle path among the global powers.Here are the latest developments from Ukraine.Four E.U. countries expel dozens of Russian diplomats suspected of espionage.He bluntly asked for help: ‘I call on you to do more.’I am grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, for his sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine and democracy all over the world. I am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all those who commit crimes against Ukraine, against the Ukrainian people, as war criminals. However, now it is true in the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more. New packages of sanctions are needed constantly, every week, until the Russian military machine stops. Restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based.Mr. Zelensky is trying to strike a balance between expressing gratitude for the military and humanitarian support Ukraine has received from the United States — including a $13.6 billion package approved by Congress last week and signed into law by Mr. Biden on Tuesday — and making clear that it is not enough. He is also playing on a fraught dynamic between the White House and Congress.For weeks now, lawmakers in both parties have pressed the Biden administration to take more aggressive steps to help Kyiv and counter Moscow, including imposing a ban on Russian oil and gas and sending more aid. In his speech, Mr. Zelensky essentially sided with members of Congress who have called for a more robust American effort, trying to prod Mr. Biden to step up his response.He called for sanctions to be imposed on “all politicians in the Russian Federation” and said additional packages of sanctions should be approved “every week.”Most Republicans and Democrats have been more than happy to rush aid to Kyiv, with their moral outrage at the situation in Ukraine eclipsing any qualms they might have about the cost or effectiveness of certain measures. Mr. Zelensky’s call to action appeared to have resonated with lawmakers, who emerged from his address pledging to send even more money and weapons.We propose that the United States sanctions all politicians in the Russian Federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against Ukraine, from State Duma’s members to the last official who has lack of morale to break this state terror. All Americans’ company must leave Russia from their market, leave their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood.Ladies and gentlemen, members of Congress, please take the lead. If you have companies in your districts who finance the Russian military machine in Russia, you should put pressure. I’m asking to make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny that they use to destroy people in Ukraine.  The destruction of our country, the destruction of Europe. All American ports should be closed for Russian goods. We — peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world. We already became part of the antiwar coalition — a big antiwar coalition that unites many countries, dozens of countries, those who reacted too in principle to President Putin’s decision to invade our country — but we need to move on and do more.We need to create new tools to respond quickly and stop the war. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24th. And it would be fair if it ended in a day, in 24 hours, that evil would be punished immediately. Today, the world does not have such tools. The war of the past have prompted our predecessors to create institutions that should protect us from war. But they unfortunately don’t work. We see it, you see it.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.So we need new ones, new institutions, new alliances, and we offer them. We propose to create an association, U-24, United for Peace, a union of responsible countries that have the strength and consciousness to stop conflicts immediately, provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours if necessary, even weapons, if necessary. Sanctions, humanitarian support, political support, finances, everything you need to keep the peace and quickly save the world, to save lives. In addition, such association, such union could provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made disasters, who fell victims to humanitarian crisis, or epidemics.Remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest thing? Just to give vaccines, vaccines against Covid to save lives, to prevent new strains. The world spent months, years doing things like that much faster to make sure there are no human losses, no victims. Ladies and gentlemen, Americans, if such alliance would exist today that is U-24, we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country, in many countries of the world.Those who need peace, those who suffer inhumane destruction. I ask you to watch one video — video of what the Russian troops did in our country, in our land. We have to stop it. We must prevent it, preventively destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations. Please watch the video.[After video plays, Mr. Zelensky resumes his speech in English.]Zelensky cast U.S. support as a moral imperative.And in the end, to sum it up, today — today it’s not enough to be the leader of the nation. Today it takes to be the leader of the world, being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace. Peace in your country doesn’t depend anymore only on you and your people. It depends on those next to you and those who are strong. Strong doesn’t mean big. Strong is brave and ready to fight for the life of his citizens and citizens of the world. For human rights, for freedom, for the right to live decently, and to die when your time comes, and not when it’s wanted by someone else, by your neighbor.Calling on America’s own image of itself as the leader of the free world, Mr. Zelensky argued that the United States had a moral duty to help defend Ukraine — indeed, any democracy under siege — even though it is not a member of NATO.The appeal carried both emotional and patriotic overtones for members of Congress, and was a passage of his address cited by several lawmakers afterward.  Mr. Zelensky’s talk of dying from natural causes echoed comments he made in recent meetings with European allies and members of Congress, in which he noted it might be the last time they saw him alive, a jarring assertion that some lawmakers privately said unsettled and moved them.Mr. Zelensky delivered the bulk of his speech in Ukrainian, using an interpreter. But after he showed a graphic video of scenes from his war-torn country, including bombs exploding in cities, and civilians bloodied and killed by Russian attacks, he concluded in English.Lawmakers had already been listening intently, but the combined effect of the video and Mr. Zelensky’s direct appeal, in his own voice, had a palpable effect on his audience.“There was a collective holding of the breath,” said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine.He said Ukraine was fighting ‘for the values of Europe and the world.’Today, the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the future. That’s why today the American people are helping not just Ukraine, but Europe and the world to give the planet the life to keep justice in history. Now, I am almost 45 years old; today, my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating. I see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths. And this is my main issue as the leader of my people, great Ukrainians.And as the leader of my nation, I am addressing the President Biden, you are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world; being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine. Thank you for your support. Thank you.Mr. Zelensky has cast Ukraine’s battle to protect itself from Russia as a fight for the cause of democracy, and in his speech to Congress, he argued that every democratic nation — but especially the United States — had a stake in that fight. He framed the conflict as a historic struggle for “justice,” hinting at an assertion he has made more directly in recent days — that if he is successful in vanquishing Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will push further into Europe next, turning to the Baltics.He concluded his speech on a deeply personal and emotional note. reminding lawmakers of how young he is to be bearing such a tremendous burden, and how deeply his people, including children, have suffered. He laid out the issue simply and starkly: his people are dying, and he needs help to stop it.Finally, he addressed Mr. Biden by name in remarks that may have been aimed as much at lawmakers and the American public, urging him to fulfill his role as leader of the free world by doing more to help Ukraine. He appeared to be inviting lawmakers to join him in pressing Mr. Biden into greater action — and in the hours after his address, many did.Mr. Biden, who held a news conference several hours later to detail additional military aid his administration was sending Ukraine, said he had watched Mr. Zelensky’s address from the White House "
Iran’s Attack Was Response to Secret Israeli Attack on Drone Sit,2022-03-17 04:01:18+00:00,"Iran fired a barrage of ballistic missiles into Iraq over the weekend, striking what it claimed was an Israeli target and leaving some analysts scratching their heads about what exactly precipitated the blitz and why Iraq.Now, officials say, the attack was retaliation for a previously secret Israeli airstrike on an Iranian drone factory last month. And, according to some officials, the Israeli intelligence operatives who launched the airstrike were based in Iraq.The tit-for-tat strikes represent an alarming escalation in the long-running shadow war between Israel and Iran, as both sides push the boundaries of a conflict that has also entangled the United States and now Iraq.For Israel, the attack on the Iranian drone facility is part of a new approach in countering Iran’s growing drone program, a tacit recognition that it is easier to pre-emptively destroy a drone than to intercept one en route. Iranian drones have been deployed in numerous attacks against Israel, as well as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and, last October, a U.S. base in Syria, according to intelligence officials.  For Iran, the missile strike in Erbil, Iraq, on Sunday reflects both a more aggressive policy of responding to Israeli attacks and a more overt one: Unlike most previous attacks attributed to Iran, Iran, not one of its proxies, immediately claimed responsibility for this one, a sign of confidence that it can do so with impunity. Iran’s use of ballistic missiles instead of rockets or drones was also a serious escalation.For years, Israel and Iran have engaged in a largely covert war, keeping their actions brief, limited and, if not completely secret, at least deniable, in an effort to prevent a full-scale direct war that neither side wants. But as the recent strikes demonstrate, each side is willing to test those limits.And in a sign of the increasing reliance on drones, or remotely piloted aircraft, Israel’s attack on the Iranian drone facility last month was carried out by drones.A senior intelligence official briefed on the operation said that six suicide quadcopter drones exploded into the Iranian facility near Kermanshah, Iran, on Feb. 12. The official, who asked not be identified when discussing sensitive intelligence issues, said the facility was Iran’s main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones, and that the Israeli attack destroyed dozens of them.Iranian officials have not confirmed that the facility was used for drones, referring to it only as a base for the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the paramilitary force that carries out much of Iran’s foreign military activities.  Iran’s drone program has been the subject of increasing concern to Israeli and American officials, as well as to Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the Emirates. A document compiled by Israeli intelligence lists 15 drone attacks carried out by Iran or its proxies in the region from February 2018 to September 2021.Israeli military officials say that Israel has been attacked by Iranian drones several times. Last year, an Israeli F35 fighter jet intercepted two drones that Israel claimed had taken off from Iran, on their way to the Gaza Strip to drop off a supply of pistols for Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza, the Israeli military said.American officials say that Iran also provides drone technology to proxy forces in Iraq and Syria, who carry out strikes against American personnel in those countries with Tehran’s blessing or direction.Last October, five so-called suicide drones were launched at the American base at Al Tanf, Syria, in what the military’s Central Command called a “deliberate and coordinated” attack. The attack caused no casualties but the drones were loaded with ball bearings and shrapnel in a “clear intent to kill,” a senior U.S. military official said.U.S. officials said they believed that Iran directed and supplied the local proxy forces that carried out the attack in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes in Syria, the first time Iran directed a military strike against the United States in response to an attack by Israel.The real wake-up call on the threat of Iran’s drone program came in 2019, with a pair of dramatic pinpoint strikes on two Saudi oil facilities carried out by a combination of drones and cruise missiles.  The strikes were claimed by the Houthis, a Yemeni insurgent group, but American and Israeli officials said they were directed and possibly carried out by Iran. Iran denied responsibility.  That strike and others led Israeli officials to conclude that the best defense against Iranian drones was to attack the production and storage sites, like the one attacked last month, according to the senior intelligence official.It was unclear what role, if any, the United States played in the February strike. The senior intelligence official said that Israeli officials briefed the United States in advance.Iranian officials have not publicly linked Israel’s attack in Iran with their attack in Iraq, but others — including an analyst close to the Revolutionary Guards, an adviser to the Iranian government, an Iranian proxy force in Iraq and a Lebanese television station affiliated with Iran — have said the Iranian attack was retaliation for the Israeli one.Iran fired more than a dozen missiles on Sunday at a site in Erbil, Iraq, that Iranian officials say the site is a base for Israeli intelligence operations against Iran.Erbil is the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdistan region of Iraq. While the Iraqi government does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, the Kurdish regional government has a long history of close ties with Israel.  “We believe this building in Erbil was a center for coordinating and planning operations against Iran’s national security and several malicious activities against Iran happened from there,” Hossein Dalirian, a prominent defense analyst affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards, said in an interview.Saeed Khatibzadeh, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, said Monday that “Iran will not tolerate that a location near its border be used for destructive and terrorist operations inside Iran.”Iraqi and Kurdish officials have denied that Israel operates a base there. Israeli officials have declined to comment.A senior U.S. official who was briefed on the strikes said the building hit in Erbil served as an Israeli intelligence outpost and training facility. But a senior Biden administration official rebutted that assessment, saying the administration believes that the building that was hit was a civilian residence only and did not also serve as an Israeli training site.The senior U.S. official and another U.S. official confirmed that Israel has conducted intelligence operations against Iran from Kurdistan, but declined to cite specific details. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence assessments.In a statement on Sunday, the State Department spokesman Ned Price said the missiles struck a private residence near the new U.S. Consulate in Erbil, which is under construction. He said that no U.S. facilities were damaged and no American personnel were injured, adding that “we have no indications the attack was directed at the United States.”Iranian officials have claimed at least once before that they had attacked Israeli intelligence bases in Iraq and killed its field personnel. That claim could not be verified.  Iran’s ambassador to Iraq, Iraj Masjedi, said in a speech in Karbala, Iraq, on Monday that Iran respects Iraq and considers it a close ally and that neither Iraq nor the United States were the targets of the attack in Erbil.But the attack does represent a more aggressive posture against Israel adopted by Iran’s relatively new hard-line government, defense analysts said. Officials in the previous Iranian government had professed a strategy of “strategic patience,” at least until the end of the Trump presidency in an effort not to give President Donald J. Trump an excuse to launch a war he seemed eager to wage.“Iran’s strategic patience has ended and from now on it will be answering attacks with attacks,” said Gheis Ghoreishi, an analyst who is close to the government.Iran is more confident about its regional policies, he said, because it is convinced that the U.S.’s maximum pressure policy — the Trump administration’s strategy of piling punishing sanctions on Iran in an effort to coerce its agreement to a more restrictive nuclear agreement — had failed.And as the Biden administration struggles to resurrect the nuclear agreement with Iran, Mr. Ghoreishi said, Iran is convinced that Washington has no appetite for another war in the region.The Revolutionary Guards, he said, have concluded that the most effective way to defend against Israel was to “increase the costs” and adopt an “eye for an eye” policy of strikes and counterstrikes.Jane Arraf contributed reporting.

W.H.O. Delays Assessing Russia’s Sputnik Vaccine Over Ukraine Wa,2022-03-17 09:32:03+00:00,"Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine against the coronavirus will have to wait longer for a decision on emergency use authorization by the World Health Organization.A W.H.O. official said on Wednesday that the organization was forced to delay the assessment process for the vaccine because of difficulties created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“We were supposed to go do inspections in Russia on the 7th of March, and these inspections were postponed for a later date,” said Dr. Mariângela Simão, an assistant director general of the W.H.O., at a news conference in Geneva. “The assessment, along with inspections, have been affected because of the situation.”Dr. Simão said that obstacles to booking flights into Russia and using credit cards while there were among the many issues confronting the agency’s inspectors. After Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, most Western countries closed their airspace to Russian aircraft, and Mastercard and Visa suspended operations in Russia.  Dr. Simão said a new timetable would be drawn up as soon as possible.  The two-dose Sputnik V was developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute, part of Russia’s Ministry of Health. Russia began distributing the vaccine in the fall of 2020, and regulators in more than 70 countries have approved it for use, according to the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which backed the vaccine’s development.But Sputnik V has not yet been approved by the European Union’s main drug regulator or the World Health Organization. Russians and other travelers who have received the vaccine have had a difficult time entering the European Union or the United States.Though President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has called Sputnik a medical breakthrough, the country repeatedly failed to follow international procedure and provide all the data foreign regulators need to assess safety of a vaccine that was rushed through large-scale clinical trials to speed its release in the fall of 2020. An E.U. health official accused Russia’s government last fall of repeatedly delaying inspections of Russian facilities. But Russian officials insist that the delays in the approval process have been political.Russia cleared a hurdle in February 2021 with the publication in the British medical journal The Lancet of late-stage trial results showing that Sputnik V vaccine was safe and highly effective. Even then, many countries, including Brazil and South Africa, have rejected using it. Ukraine also does not recognize Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine.  The United Nations-backed Covax program that distributes vaccines globally to low- and moderate-income nations cannot use vaccines that are not approved by the W.H.O.About half of Russian adults have been fully vaccinated, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford.

ur Thursday Briefing: Zelensky Speaks to Cong,2022-03-18 10:45:26.815000+00:00,"Good morning. We’re covering Zelensky’s speech to U.S. lawmakers, an offshore earthquake in Japan and mass graves in Syria.  Zelensky addresses CongressPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine pleaded on Wednesday for more weapons and sanctions, showing searing footage of civilian casualties during a virtual address to U.S. lawmakers. In a remarkably direct appeal, he invoked the memories of Pearl Harbor and the Sept. 11 attacks. “We need you right now,” he said. “I call on you to do more.”Zelensky pressed for a NATO no-fly zone over Ukraine, which the U.S. and alliance leaders have rejected because it would draw NATO pilots into direct confrontation with the Russians. Follow live updates here.He also asked for more weapons and antiaircraft batteries, a request to which Republicans and Democrats have been far more receptive, and for sanctions to be ratcheted up “every week” against Russia. Members of Congress were visibly emotional.What’s next: The U.S. warned Russia against using chemical or biological weapons, as President Biden announced $800 million more in military aid for Ukraine. NATO’s ministers will discuss enhancing defenses along the eastern front as Russia presses closer.  Diplomacy: After military setbacks, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said that there was “hope that a certain compromise can be reached.”Analysis: For President Vladimir Putin, the war is about ethnicity and empire, which have deep roots in Russian thought. In a video, he described the war in Ukraine as part of an existential clash with the U.S. and denigrated pro-Western Russians as “scum and traitors.”Other updates:Ukraine launched counterattacks outside Kyiv and Kherson, aiming to inflict severe losses on Russian forces.At least 500 civilians have been killed in the Russian shelling of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, since the start of the war, officials said. More than 10 people waiting in a line for bread died in a shelling attack in the northern city of Chernihiv on Wednesday, the regional governor said.Past sanctions have made little dent into the vast wealth of Russian oligarchs. Governments are trying to give them more bite.Videos show that a theater in Mariupol where hundreds of civilians were seen sheltering in recent days had been largely destroyed.  An offshore quake in JapanTwo small tsunami waves hit the Japanese coast after a magnitude-7.3 earthquake offshore. Despite a tsunami alert in the Fukushima region, which was battered by a devastating quake and tsunami just over 11 years ago, there were no immediate reports of casualties. Follow live updates here.  U.S. scientists said the temblor was unlikely to generate a destructive tsunami or to cause mass casualties. Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority said that so far it had detected no abnormalities at nuclear power plants in Fukushima, Onagawa and Tokai.Details: About two million people were without power, but the extent of the damage was unclear. Close to 39,000 people were advised to evacuate the area of the Miyagi prefecture. The quake also derailed a bullet train, but no injuries have been reported.  Mass graves identified in SyriaTwo mass graves have been located near Damascus. They are believed to hold thousands of bodies of Syrians who were killed in detention centers run by President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 30, 2022, 5:42 a.m. ETStrikes continue in the Chernihiv region, despite Russia’s promises.Putin’s war complicates India’s middle path among the global powers.Here are the latest developments in Ukraine.Interviews The Times conducted with four Syrian men who worked at or near secret mass graves led to an examination of satellite images. Those clues revealed the locations of two sites. Each one holds thousands of bodies, according to the men who worked there.The graves could contain powerful evidence of war crimes committed by al-Assad’s forces, including systematic torture.  Background: Throughout Syria’s 11-year civil war, more than 144,000 people disappeared into government detention centers. Many of them are presumed dead. The U.S. Treasury Department said last year that at least 14,000 had been tortured to death, but the actual number is almost certainly much higher.What’s next: Counting and identifying the bodies is unlikely to happen with al-Assad in power. Russia continues to support him, and he and his senior officials have never been held accountable for wartime atrocities.THE LATEST NEWSAsia and the Middle East  Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian charity worker, was released after six years in detention in Iran. A second British-Iranian detainee was also released.North Korea launched an unidentified projectile on Wednesday, but the South Korean military said it failed “immediately after liftoff.”CoronavirusEurope may be heading for another Omicron variant surge, but restrictions continue to loosen.India started vaccinating 12- to 14-year-olds on Wednesday, as schools reopened after two years of closures.Amid an outbreak, China revised its guidelines to include the use of Paxlovid, the antiviral pill made by Pfizer.​​South Korean officials reported a record 400,741 cases on Wednesday. The country continues to ease restrictions.Japan said Wednesday it was planning to end restrictions in Tokyo and 17 other prefectures next week, citing a drop in cases.New Zealand, where cases remain near peak levels, plans to welcome foreign tourists months ahead of schedule.U.S. News  The Fed lifted its key interest rate by a quarter point and projected six more increases this year as it tries to tame rapid inflation.The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bill that would end the practice of changing the clocks twice a year and put the country on permanent Daylight Saving Time.Jim Li, a lawyer in New York City who had been a key participant in the pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square in 1989, died after an irate client stabbed him, the police said.What Else Is HappeningIn a surprise reversal, Guatemala shelved a bill that would have imposed up to 10 years of jail time for women who obtained abortions.An Evergreen ship is stuck in the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, a year after a container ship by the same company blocked the Suez Canal.A Morning Read  More than a century after sinking in Antarctic waters, Ernest Shackleton’s legendary ship, Endurance, was found with just four days to spare.

There’s just one catch: It’s Chinese.China’s nearly picture-perfect reproduction has sent shock waves through Japan, the world’s aging video game superpower. In its first year on the market, it raked in $2 billion, a record for mobile games, according to a tracking firm.But Genshin Impact’s success should come as no surprise: Chinese developers, flush with cash, are looking abroad for growth. They see Japan as a ripe target for growth and have begun hiring Japanese talent in earnest.The game’s success points to a shifting balance of power in the $200 billion-a-year global video game industry, long dominated by Japan and the U.S. But despite Genshin Impact’s technical mastery, the game is a reminder of China’s significant creative shortcomings: It’s still imitating Japan.PLAY, WATCH, EATWhat to Cook  This peanut-butter wafer cake comes together quickly and easily, despite its impressive combination of flavors and textures.What to Read“Vagabonds!” is a supernatural exploration of queerness and corruption in Lagos.What to WatchThese five international movies to stream include an otherworldly Mexican comedy and a mysterious Brazilian thriller.Now Time to PlayPlay today’s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Popular first guess word in Wordle, due to its four vowels (five letters).

"Justin Smith, Former Bloomberg C.E.O., Offers New Details on Media Start-up",2022-03-17 03:31:07+00:00,"It will be named for a word that is the same in dozens of languages. It will recruit English-speaking journalists from countries like India and Singapore to cover the news. And according to its co-founder, “The era of the foreign correspondent is over.”These are among the ideas in store for the new media venture led by Justin Smith, the former chief executive of Bloomberg Media, and Ben Smith, the former editor of BuzzFeed and media columnist for The New York Times, according to remarks by Justin Smith during an online seminar on Tuesday.The Smiths, who are not related, have been tight-lipped about plans for their new company, which has captured the fascination of the media industry because of its high-profile founders and their ambitious pledge to compete with international outlets like Reuters, The Associated Press and The Times.The Smiths are seeking tens of millions of dollars in funding from prominent investors. This week, they announced the hiring of Gina Chua, a top editor at Reuters who will serve as executive editor.  On Tuesday, Justin Smith offered some new details during an hourlong Zoom interview sponsored by the Harvard Business School Club of New York.“We’ve chosen a brand that we’re going to be unveiling in a couple of months that is the same word in 25 or 35 different languages,” Mr. Smith told the moderator. “It is very intentionally going to be able to live in Asia or Europe or the Middle East or America.”Mr. Smith did not reveal the name that he had selected. English words that are the same or similar in many other languages include taxi, tea, coffee, chai, sugar, pajama, radio and soup.  Mr. Smith also shared his thoughts about what he called the end of an era when news outlets based in London, New York or Washington dispatched journalists to foreign countries to report on the goings-on there. He asked why foreign readers would not prefer a homegrown English-speaking native to report the news in their region.  “The idea that you send some well-educated young graduate from the Ivy League to Mumbai to tell us about what’s going on in Mumbai in 2022 is sort of insane,” Mr. Smith said.Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated March 29, 2022, 6:25 p.m. ETState attorneys general ask Snap and TikTok to give parents more control over apps.Nielsen agrees to $16 billion private equity takeover.Oscars audience grew by 555,000 after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock.Instead, he said, he will pursue “very educated, English-language-educated journalists all around the world,” describing an opportunity “for scaling local and regional newsrooms at a lower cost.”He also argued that many foreign news readers were ill served.“You maybe went to school in the U.S., you’re pretty well educated, you’re connected to your network and your family all around the world — and the quality of your local media is not amazing,” Mr. Smith said. “It’s either state-censored or, it’s just, the journalism’s not great.”“So what do you do?” he continued. “You say, OK, well, let me let me pick up The New York Times, or let me pick up The Wall Street Journal, or let me pick up The Washington Post. And what do you get? You get exactly what you’d expect if you read something that had the word New York in it, or something that has the word Washington in it. Or you go to CNN and you get a feed from Atlanta, some regional story from the Midwest, and you’re sitting in Singapore.”(The Post and The Times, among other American outlets, have expanded their reporting presence in Europe in recent years. CNN broadcasts an international feed outside the United States.)Mr. Smith told his audience that he was reluctant to share too many plans. (“There’s not a huge advantage when you’re starting a new company to be giving away all the specifics.”) But he allowed that he hoped to launch in the United States and “at least one other major international market,” and that a live events business would be integrated. The co-founders are aiming to launch in the second half of this year.Mr. Smith also said he was intrigued by automated translation of non-English-language news articles. “The quality of translation software for journalism is really quite amazing; it captures subtlety and nuance in a way it did not in previous years,” he said.  At one point, the moderator cited a quote from Ben Smith that the company’s potential market included 200 million educated English speakers “who no one is really treating like an audience.”“That vague platitude,” Justin Smith joked. He added, “The end-stage vision is that we will serve many, many portions of this audience all across the world.” "
"Putin Assails Russians Who Back the West, Signaling More Repression",2022-03-16 22:56:47+00:00,"President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday referred to pro-Western Russians as “scum and traitors” who needed to be removed from society, describing the war in Ukraine as part of an existential clash with the United States and setting the stage for an ever fiercer crackdown at home and even more aggression abroad.Comparing the West to Nazi Germany, the Russian leader laced his speech with derision for the “political beau monde” in Europe and the United States, and for the “slave-like” Russians who supported it. It was a far more hard-line message than one delivered earlier in the day by Mr. Putin’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, who said that Russia saw “a certain hope that a compromise can be reached” with Ukraine to end the war.The clash in tone indicated that even as Mr. Putin was directing his officials to explore a negotiated end to a war in which Russia faced far heavier resistance than the Kremlin had anticipated, he was prepared to keep raising the stakes in his conflict with the West. And in reserving his toughest language for fellow Russians who disagreed with him, Mr. Putin opened the door to a new wave of repression that, analysts fear, could hit a much broader swath of society than the activists and journalists the Kremlin has targeted in recent months.  “The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into their mouths,” Mr. Putin said. “I am convinced that such a natural and necessary self-purification of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to respond to any challenges.”The beginnings of a new crackdown quickly emerged. The authorities announced a criminal case against a popular lifestyle blogger, Veronika Belotserkovskaya, for antiwar Instagram posts that “discredited the state authorities and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.” The government blocked access to the website of BBC News and promised that this was “only the beginning of the response to the information war unleashed by the West against Russia.”“The struggle we are waging is a struggle for our sovereignty, for the future of our country and our children,” Mr. Putin said.Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of a political analysis firm, R. Politik, said Mr. Putin was signaling to law enforcement authorities across the country that they should target “all spheres of society that show any sympathy to the Western way of life.” “This speech was, in part, an informal and indirect sanctioning of mass repression,” Ms. Stanovaya said. “His speech was scary — very scary.”  Mr. Putin insisted in his speech, which he delivered at the beginning of a televised videoconference with senior officials, that Russia’s military tactics in Ukraine had “fully justified themselves.” But even pro-Kremlin analysts said that Russia was becoming bogged down in a bloodier conflict than anticipated — because Mr. Putin had apparently believed that many Ukrainian soldiers would lay down their arms rather than fight. “The military operation is, no question, tougher going than had been expected,” said Sergey Markov, a pro-Kremlin commentator who appears frequently on state television. “It was expected that 30 to 50 percent of the Ukrainian Armed Forces would switch over to Russia’s side. No one is switching over.” As a result, Mr. Putin appears to be probing for an exit that would fall short of his original aim to topple the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine — even as his military continues to pound Ukrainian cities. Russian and Ukrainian officials spoke by video link for a third straight day on Wednesday, and Mr. Putin’s lead negotiator said there had been “a certain progress on a number of positions, but not all of them.”But Mr. Putin has made it clear that he sees Ukraine as only one battlefield in his wider conflict with the West — a fight, he reiterated on Wednesday, that he sees as existential. Ms. Stanovaya said that Mr. Putin appeared to be leaving the unpleasant work of negotiating a compromise end to the war to his officials, while himself setting the stage for a bigger showdown ahead with the West and with pro-Western Russians. It was also possible, she said, that the negotiations were a bluff to buy the Kremlin time to prepare for an assault on Kyiv. “It’s dirty work to negotiate with Nazis,” she said, sarcastically channeling Mr. Putin’s rhetoric about Ukraine’s leaders. “He’s got little to be happy about in this situation.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.The West, Mr. Putin said in his speech Wednesday, was waging “total, undisguised” war against Russia with an “economic blitzkrieg” as well as “political and informational means.” In a blunt acknowledgment of the pain caused by Western sanctions, he said Russia had to prepare for a “temporary rise in inflation and unemployment” as it embarked on “deep, structural changes of our economy.”   Mr. Putin claimed that the West was echoing the Nazis’ antisemitic pogroms in trying to “cancel” Russia by banning “Russian music, culture and literature.”“There is only one goal,” Mr. Putin said. “The destruction of Russia.” Mr. Putin said he would fight back — including by cracking down on the West’s supporters inside Russia. He has spoken in years past about a “fifth column” of treacherous Russians whose allegiances are with the West. But on Wednesday, he reprised that theme with a new intensity, suggesting that any Russian with ties to the West could be considered a traitor. “They will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on national traitors, on those who earn money here, with us, but live there,” Mr. Putin said. “And ‘live’ not even in the geographical sense of the word, but in their thoughts, in their slave-like consciousness.”Shortly after the speech, Russia’s Investigative Committee announced it had launched criminal cases against several Russians under the law Mr. Putin signed this month potentially criminalizing any deviation from the official narrative of what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation,” not a war. By naming Ms. Belotserkovskaya, the lifestyle blogger, as a suspect, the authorities made it clear that anyone could be a target in this wave of repression. The government also blocked access to BBC News, making the British broadcaster the most prominent Western media outlet to be hit by the Kremlin’s campaign to prevent ordinary Russians from seeing independent news reporting about the war. “An unprecedented information campaign has been unleashed, which involves global social networks and all Western media, the objectivity and independence of which turned out to be just a myth,” Mr. Putin said.

"Saharan Sands Float North to Europe, Coating Cities With Dust",2022-03-17 15:32:35.965000+00:00,"Dust from the Sahara drifted north into Europe for a second day on Wednesday, coating parked cars in a rusty, reddish layer in Spain and creating an ominous orange glow in skies across the continent.The sandstorm, known as a calima in Spain, began covering much of the Iberian Peninsula on Tuesday morning, blanketing cars and buildings in a thick red dust and making it harder to breathe in the stiflingly dry air.A calima occurs when a burst of dusty, warm wind forms during sandstorms in the Sahara, the desert in northern Africa, and then crosses over. With rain forecast in Madrid on Thursday morning, residents were bracing themselves for a muddy rain.“There’s not much that can be done at this stage,” said Miguel Serrano, a porter in Madrid, who said he had been busy sweeping dust outside his building on Wednesday. “Let’s now see whether the rain helps clean it up, or at least makes the air more pleasant.”  While Spain’s skies tended toward the apocalyptic, with blood orange colors reminiscent of areas besieged by wildfires, the effects were more subtle elsewhere.  From the Swiss Alps to Britain, residents of countries far from the Sahara looked out their windows on Wednesday and noticed something slightly off. It was not the end times, sky-on-fire hues of Spain, but rather a vague sense that this is not how it usually is.In London, it was as if the skies had been run through a sepia-toned filter, a slightly unsettling aura that could easily be taken as a harbinger of nothing good. It was the gray-orange color the sky would be in a movie about a town recovering from nuclear fallout.  Though the phenomenon isn’t new, the European Union’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service described this week’s events as “an exceptional Saharan dust episode,” with “very high concentrations of coarse particulate matter.”  Mark Parrington, a senior scientist at the service, said it was not unusual in February and March for wind to kick up sand in the Sahara, sending it on an international voyage as far away as South America. There were traces of Saharan dust in Britain last year as well, he said.But it is typically not as noticeable as it has been this week, he said. The storm was stronger because of “weather patterns being in the right configuration to bring it directly into Europe,” he said.In the coming days, the dust is expected to move north through Europe, reaching as far as Denmark, before fading by the weekend, the monitoring service said.“The current concentrations of particulate matter in the transports are exceptionally high, and some studies predict that climate change will result in even more intense Saharan dust storms in the future,” the service said in a statement. It added that the storms would threaten to worsen air quality, affect the frequency of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and speed the decline of glaciers.  On Wednesday, Spain’s health ministry called the sandstorm an emergency situation and issued a warning to residents to stay indoors and keep doors and windows shut to avoid inhaling particles, particularly people with existing breathing problems. The ministry also warned drivers to show caution because of the diminished visibility. Overall, the ministry said people should “reduce all outdoor activity.”  Spain is often on the front line of winds and storms coming from the Sahara and Sahel deserts because it is separated from Morocco only by the narrow Strait of Gibraltar. Still, weather experts said that it was extremely rare for the calima to hit Madrid and other parts of central or northern Spain with such intensity.Episodes of calima are, however, relatively common in the Canary Islands, the Spanish archipelago off the northwestern coast of Africa. In February 2020, the Canary Islands were hit by their worst sandstorm in 40 years, forcing airports to close at a time of year when the islands receive many tourists from northern Europe seeking a mild winter climate.

"Olga Smirnova, Opposed to the Ukraine War, Quits the Bol",2022-03-16 22:44:51.889000+00:00,"Olga Smirnova, who has for over a decade been a star of the Bolshoi, the Russian company whose name is synonymous with ballet, has left.In a move likely to shake up the ballet world, Ms. Smirnova, 30, on Wednesday announced that she had joined the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam, becoming one of the most significant Russian cultural figures to leave the country because of its invasion of Ukraine.Ms. Smirnova, who since 2016 has been a principal soloist at the Bolshoi, said in a news release that she had been thinking about leaving for some time. “It’s just that the current circumstances accelerated this process.”The ballerina has been vocal in her opposition to the war, a position that made it untenable for her to keep working in the country, the release said. The Kremlin has clamped down fiercely on free speech, and earlier this month, Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, passed a law making it illegal to spread “false information” about the war, punishable with up to 15 years in prison.  Ms. Smirnova published a lengthy post this month to Telegram, the messaging app popular in Russia, in which she said she opposed the war “with all the fibers of my soul.” One of her grandfathers was Ukrainian, she said, but insisted that was not the sole reason for her opposition. “I never thought I would be ashamed of Russia,” she said, adding, “We may not be at the epicenter of the military conflict, but we cannot remain indifferent to this global catastrophe.”A spokeswoman for the Bolshoi, which still lists Ms. Smirnova among its dancers on its website, said it had no comment on her departure, except to confirm that it was a personal decision.Ms. Smirnova is one of a number of dancers who have left, at least temporarily, the Bolshoi and the Mariinsky Ballet, Russia’s other major company, since the invasion of Ukraine began. But most of those other dancers, including the Italian Jacopo Tissi, the Brazilian David Motta Soares and the British dancer Xander Parish, have not been Russian.In an interview from Tallinn, Estonia, last week, Mr. Parish, who dances for the Mariinsky, told The Sunday Times, a British newspaper, that he intended to focus on international guest appearances for the next few months. “It’s hard to imagine not being able to go back, but I just need to keep positive and look for opportunities,” he said.On Wednesday, the Dutch National Ballet said that Victor Caixeta, a Brazilian soloist at the Mariinsky Ballet, had also joined the company. “The current circumstances have meant I’ve had to make the hard decision of leaving Russia — the place I’ve called home for almost five years,” Mr. Caixeta said in a statement.  Leila Guchmazova, a Russian dance critic, said in a Telegram message that Ms. Smirnova’s decision to leave was like “a bomb” in the Russian ballet world. Since the Soviet Union ended, she said, “dancers left the Bolshoi to find new abilities and better positions” but Ms. Smirnova, who had it all, departed because she “prefers to express her opinion.”How the Ukraine War Is Affecting the Cultural WorldCard 1 of 8Olga Smirnova. A principal soloist at the Bolshoi Ballet since 2016, Ms. Smirnova announced that she had joined the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam, becoming one of the most significant Russian cultural figures to leave the country because of its invasion of Ukraine.Tugan Sokhiev. The Russian conductor, who recently resigned from two high-profile posts after facing pressure to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, will no longer lead a series of concerts with the New York Philharmonic because of the war.Paavo Järvi. The Estonian American conductor was in Moscow, leading rehearsals for an engagement with a Russian youth orchestra, when Russia began its attack on Ukraine.

The Guggenheim Museum said that the Russian businessman and close associate of Mr. Putin would step down as one of its trustees, a position he took on in 2002. While no reason was given for the decision, the museum’s statement referenced the war in Ukraine.Valery Gergiev. The star Russian maestro and vocal supporter of Mr. Putin was removed from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Russia’s actions in Ukraine. His abrupt dismissal came three years before his contract was set to expire.Alexei Ratmansky. The choreographer, who grew up in Kyiv, was preparing a new ballet at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow when the invasion began, and immediately decided to leave Moscow. The ballet, whose premiere was set for March 30, was postponed indefinitely.Gérard Depardieu. The French actor, who became a Russian citizen in 2013 and is one of the closest Western celebrities to Mr. Putin, took a surprising stance when he denounced the war during an interview.Ms. Smirnova’s fans in Russia, including in the sponsors’ circles, will be impressed by the decision, Ms. Guchmazova said, but added that it was “very important” to realize that the mood at the Bolshoi toward the “special operation in Ukraine,” as it is known in Russia, is far from the government’s position. Vladimir Urin, the Bolshoi’s general director, signed a petition against the operation soon after it began, she said.There have been other upheavals at the Bolshoi because of the war. Alexei Ratmansky, the Bolshoi’s former artistic director and now artist in residence at American Ballet Theater, was preparing a new ballet for the company in Moscow when the invasion began and he immediately left. The project is officially on hold, but Mr. Ratmansky told The New York Times that he doubted he would return to Russia to work “if Putin is still president.”Ms. Smirnova has been a star at the Bolshoi almost since she joined the company in 2011, making her departure all the more notable. In an article in 2013 in The New York Times, Ms. Smirnova was described as “a rarity, a ballerina whose every movement feels luminously right and true.”Global ballet audiences will be able to see her again soon. The Dutch National Ballet said Ms. Smirnova would make her debut in April, performing the title role in Marius Petipa’s romantic “Raymonda,” a classic of Russian ballet. "
Exports to Russia Blocked by U.S. and Its All,2022-03-16 19:02:56+00:00,"WASHINGTON — The United States, in partnership with its allies, has hit Russia with some of the most sweeping export restrictions ever imposed, barring companies across the world from sending advanced technology in order to penalize President Vladimir V. Putin for his invasion of Ukraine.The restrictions are aimed at cutting off the flow of semiconductors, aircraft components and other technologies that are crucial to Russia’s defense, maritime and aerospace industries, in a bid to cripple Mr. Putin’s ability to wage war. But the extent to which the measures hinder Russia’s abilities will depend on whether companies around the globe follow the rules.Enforcing the new restrictions poses a significant challenge as governments try to police thousands of companies. But the task could be made easier because the United States is acting in concert with so many other countries.The European Union, Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain and South Korea have joined the United States in imposing their own restrictions. And governments including Singapore and Taiwan, a major global producer of semiconductors, have indicated they will support the rules.  “Because we have the full cooperation and alignment with so many countries, it makes enforcement a lot easier,” Gina Raimondo, the U.S. secretary of commerce, said in an interview. “Every country is going to be doing enforcement.”“That’s part of the power, if you will, of having so much collaboration,” she added.Officials from the Commerce Department, which is in charge of enforcing the U.S. rules, have already begun digging through shipping containers and detaining electronics, aircraft parts and other goods that are destined for Russia. On March 2, federal agents detained two speedboats at the Port of Charleston valued at $150,000 that were being exported to Russia, according to senior U.S. officials.To look for any potential violators, federal agents will be combing through tips from industry sources and working with Customs and Border Protection to find anomalies in export data that might point to shipments to Russia. They are also reaching out to known exporters to Russia to get them on board with the new restrictions, speaking to about 20 or 30 companies a day, U.S. officials said.Their efforts extend beyond U.S. borders. On March 3, Commerce Department officials spoke to a gathering of 300 businesspeople in Beijing about how to comply with the new restrictions. U.S. officials have also been coordinating with other governments to ensure that they are taking a tough stance on enforcement, senior U.S. officials said.Emily Kilcrease, director of the Energy, Economics and Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said that the level of allied cooperation in forging the export controls was “completely unprecedented,” and that international coordination would have an important upside.  “The allied countries will be active partners in enforcement efforts, rather than the United States attempting to enforce its own unilateral rules extraterritorially,” she said.It remains to be seen how effective the rules are in degrading Russia’s military capability or dissuading its aggression against Ukraine. But in their initial form, the broad scope of the measures looks like a victory for the multilateralism that President Biden promised to restore.Mr. Biden entered office pledging to mend ties with Europe and other allies that had been alienated by former President Donald J. Trump’s “America first” approach. A key part of the argument was that the United States could exert more pressure on countries like China when it was not acting alone.That approach has been particularly important for export controls, which experts argue can do more harm than good when imposed by only one country — a criticism that was sometimes leveled at the export controls the Trump administration issued on China.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine has unified Western governments like few issues before. But even with countries eager to penalize Russia, coordinating restrictions on a vast array of complex technologies among more than 30 governments was not simple. The Commerce Department held more than 50 discussions with officials from other countries between the end of January and Feb. 24, when the controls were announced, as they hashed out the details, senior U.S. officials said.Much of that effort fell to Matthew S. Borman, a three-decade employee of the Commerce Department, who in late January began near-daily conversations with the European Commission and other countries.  In mid-February, Mr. Borman and a senior aerospace engineer flew to Brussels for meetings with Peter Sandler, the European director general of trade, and other staff. As a “freedom convoy” protesting coronavirus restrictions attempted to roll into Brussels, they worked from early in the morning until late in the night amid reams of paper and spreadsheets of complex technological descriptions.Each country had its own byzantine regulations, and its own interests, to consider. The European Commission had to consult the European Union’s 27 member countries, especially tech powers like Germany, France, the Netherlands and Finland, on which products could be cut off. Officials debated whether to crack down on the Russian oil industry, at a time of soaring gas prices and inflation.As Russia’s neighbors, the Europeans wanted to ensure that Russia still had access to certain goods for public safety, like nuclear reactor components to avoid a Chernobyl-style meltdown. At least one country insisted that auto exports to Russia should continue, a senior administration official said.The breakthrough came when American officials offered a compromise. The Biden administration planned to issue a rule that would bar companies anywhere around the world from exporting certain products to Russia if they were made using American technology. But those measures would not apply in countries that joined the United States and Europe in issuing their own technological restrictions on Russia.In an interview, Mr. Borman said that American allies had historically been concerned with the extraterritorial reach of U.S. export controls, and that the exclusions for countries that imposed their own rules “was really the key piece.”The Russia-Ukraine War and the Global EconomyCard 1 of 6Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion.  Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.“We all realized that at a strategic level what was most important was to have a unified allied position,” he said.The rules now prevent companies around the world from sending Russia high-tech goods like chips, telecommunications items and navigation equipment. They are even tougher for certain entities with ties to the Russian military, which cannot import so much as a pencil or toothbrush.  Ms. Raimondo said the impact of the measures were likely to be felt for months, rather than weeks, as Russian tanks and aircraft were destroyed and the controls prevented the Russian military from obtaining materials to fix them. Over time, she said, the restrictions should prove “very disabling to their military.”While some companies may want to continue supplying parts to Russia in violation of those rules, there are powerful incentives against doing so, U.S. officials said, including the detention of goods, fines and even jail time. The Commerce Department has 130 federal agents working in 30 cities in the United States to check for violators, as well as nine employees overseas. It expects to add personnel in Europe and Asia to carry out more expansive checks, officials said.Kevin Wolf, an international trade partner at Akin Gump and a former Commerce Department official, said carrying out the policy was likely to be “extraordinarily complex” but would immediately alter company behavior.“Even if they’re not perfect, I still think you will see a significant reaction by multinationals to do everything they can to comply,” Mr. Wolf said.“Just because people speed doesn’t mean you don’t have a speeding limit,” he added.One potential focus is China, which has expressed a worrying allegiance with Russia. But Chinese leaders have also hinted that they will comply with the sanctions to protect their own economic interests.Ms. Raimondo has warned that the United States could take “devastating” action against Chinese companies that violate the policy, cutting them off from the U.S. technology and equipment necessary to make their products.  “They have their own self-interest to not supply this stuff to Russia,” she said.On Monday, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, met with a Chinese foreign affairs official, Yang Jiechi, in Rome to discuss reports that Russia had asked China for economic and military assistance for its war in Ukraine.China has denied those reports. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Monday that she was not able to confirm any intelligence, but that Mr. Sullivan had conveyed that if China provided military or other assistance that violated sanctions or supported the war effort “there will be significant consequences.”“But in terms of what the specifics look like, we would coordinate with our partners and allies to make that determination,” she added.

Boris Johnson Travels to Saudi Arabia for Oil Diplomacy,2022-03-16 18:10:38+00:00,"LONDON — Stepping up the search for alternatives to Russian energy, Britain’s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on Wednesday visited Saudi Arabia in hopes of persuading the oil producer to boost output and relieve pressure on global markets.But at home, critics had another take on Mr. Johnson’s efforts to reduce western reliance on Russia’s President, Vladimir V. Putin: Going from one dictator to another.With Europeans seeking to wean their economies off supplies of Russian fossil fuels, Mr. Johnson has described Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which he also visited on Wednesday, as “key international parties.” The world needs to “deal with the new reality” following the invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Johnson said before leaving London.But his visit to Saudi Arabia comes just days after the country executed 81 people. And Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, also approved the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, according to a U.S. intelligence report.  Speaking in Parliament in London on Wednesday, Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, accused Mr. Johnson’s government of having a failed energy policy and said the prime minister had “gone cap in hand from one dictator to another on a begging mission to the Saudi prince to bail him out.” Mr. Johnson was, she said, relying on a “murderous dictator to keep the lights on and pumps open.”Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, responded by saying the government had consistently raised human rights concerns in Saudi Arabia, applied sanctions against Mr. Khashoggi’s killers and would “never allow our moral red lines to be blurred.”But on Tuesday, one of Mr. Johnson’s own lawmakers, Crispin Blunt, condemned the recent executions in Saudi Arabia, appealing to the prime minister to make it clear in Riyadh “how appalled” friends of the country were.Mr. Johnson’s hectic diplomacy exemplifies the dilemmas and obstacles faced by Western leaders if they hope to limit the economic impact on their citizens from reducing reliance on Russian hydrocarbons.Though Britain is not itself a particularly big importer of Russian energy, other European nations are — and the price of oil and gas has spiked. Big producers in the Gulf could significantly help western European economies by boosting their output but do not have any obvious economic incentive to do so.  Nor are they necessarily aligned diplomatically. Before heading to Riyadh, Mr. Johnson landed in the United Arab Emirates which, along with China and India, abstained from a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.While Britain’s government has criticized human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia — including the executions conducted over the weekend — it has done so less stridently than many other countries.Ahead of Mr. Johnson’s visit, Downing Street said that the prime minister would raise Britain’s objections to capital punishment with Crown Prince Mohammed, but it would not commit to do the same over Mr. Khashoggi’s murder. British government officials played down expectations that the meetings would produce instant results, presenting them, instead, as part of a longer-term process. "
"Benjamin Hall, Fox News Journalist Who Was Injured in Ukraine, Is Now Saf",2022-03-16 14:45:17+00:00,"Benjamin Hall, the Fox News correspondent who was seriously injured when his vehicle came under fire outside Kyiv on Monday, is now safe and being treated outside of Ukraine, the network said.“Ben is alert and in good spirits,” Suzanne Scott, the chief executive of Fox News Media, wrote in a staff memo on Wednesday. “He is being treated with the best possible care in the world and we are in close contact with his wife and family. Please continue to keep him in your prayers.”Mr. Hall, 39, was injured in the same attack that killed a Fox News cameraman, Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and a young Ukrainian journalist, Oleksandra Kuvshynova, 24, who had been working alongside the Fox News reporting team.The episode has thrown into sharp relief the lethal dangers faced by foreign journalists covering the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  On Sunday, the American filmmaker and journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was shot and killed while reporting in a suburb of Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital.Mr. Hall, who has covered conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and other countries, joined Fox News in 2015. He had been hospitalized in Ukraine after the attack and his condition had remained unclear for the past 48 hours.Many people at Fox News have been deeply shaken by the incident, which marks the first time that Fox News employees have been killed in a war zone.

Putin’s War on Ukraine Is About Ethnicity and Emp,2022-03-16 22:46:31+00:00,"BRUSSELS — President Biden took office with the idea that this century’s struggle would be between the world’s democracies and autocracies.But in waging war on Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has been driven by a different concept, ethno-nationalism. It is an idea of nationhood and identity based on language, culture and blood — a collectivist ideology with deep roots in Russian history and thought.Mr. Putin has repeatedly asserted that Ukraine is not a real state and that the Ukrainians are not a real people, but actually Russian, part of a Slavic heartland that also includes Belarus.“Putin wants to consolidate the civilizational border of Russia, as he calls it, and he is doing that by invading a sovereign European country,” said Ivan Vejvoda, a senior fellow at the Institute of Human Sciences in Vienna.  In this sense, argues Ivan Krastev, the war is one of recolonization, capturing lands ruled by the Russian empire and the Soviet Union. “Even if Ukraine were autocratic, it would not be tolerated by Putin,” he said. “He’s reconsolidating imperial nationalism.’’If Mr. Putin began as a “Soviet man, a red colonel,” said Mr. Krastev, a Bulgarian who is chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, “he now attacks the Soviet Union as a repressor of the Russian people. For him, this is an identity war.”For Mr. Putin’s opponents in Ukraine and the West, nations are built on civic responsibility, the rule of law and the rights of individuals and minorities, including free expression and a free vote.  “What Russia is doing is not just making war against an innocent nation here,” said Timothy Snyder, a professor at Yale who has written extensively about Russia and Ukraine, but attacking assumptions about a peaceful Europe that respects borders, national sovereignty and multilateral institutions.  “The Russian leadership is deliberately undoing the linguistic and the moral structure that we drew from the Second World War,” he said.Underlying the war is a clash of political systems, “a war against liberal democracy” and Ukraine’s right to self-determination, said Nathalie Tocci, the director of Italy’s International Affairs Institute. But that is just part of a larger conflict, she said, as Mr. Putin tries to change the meaning of what it is to be sovereign.“He’s going back to a dangerous, irredentist and ethnic nationalist view of sovereignty and self-determination,” Ms. Tocci said.Mr. Vejvoda, who is a Serb, notes that the concept of ethno-nationalism is one that the former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic manipulated as well, asserting that the old Yugoslavia repressed Serbian identity and ambitions. While Mr. Milosevic used such arguments in a cynical fashion, Mr. Putin seems to have imbibed them wholeheartedly.The idea of Russia as a separate civilization from the West with which it competes goes back centuries, to the roots of Orthodox Christianity and the notion of Moscow as a “third Rome,” following Rome itself and Constantinople. Mr. Snyder has examined the sources of what he has called a form of Russian Christian fascism, including Ivan Ilyin, a writer born in 1883, who saw salvation in a totalitarian state led by a righteous individual.  Ilyin’s ideas have been revived and celebrated by Mr. Putin and his close circle of security men and allies like Yuri Kovalchuk, who was described recently by Mikhail Zygar, the former editor of the independent news channel TV Rain, as “an ideologue, subscribing to a worldview that combines Orthodox Christian mysticism, anti-American conspiracy theories and hedonism.”  Mr. Putin has been similarly taken by the ideas of Lev Gumilyov, a Soviet-era historian and ethnologist who promoted “Eurasianism” as an antidote to European influence, and Aleksandr Dugin, who has advanced that notion to promote an ultranationalist view of Russia’s destiny as a conservative empire in perpetual conflict with the liberal Western world. Their histories have been described notably by Charles Clover in his book, “Black Wind, White Snow: The Rise of Russia’s New Nationalism.”Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 30, 2022, 1:04 a.m. ETHere are the latest developments from Ukraine.Four E.U. countries expel dozens of Russian diplomats suspected of espionage.The chief of the U.N. food agency warns of a crisis not seen since World War II.Mr. Dugin, who has long pressed for the reabsorption of Ukraine, is sometimes called “Putin’s philosopher.” In 2014, Mr. Dugin said: “Only after restoring the Greater Russia that is the Eurasian Union, we can become a credible global player.” The Ukrainian revolt against Russian influence that year he called “a coup d’état by the United States,” a Western attempt to stop “the advance of Russian integration.”But if Mr. Putin once seemed to use such views cynically to fill the ideological hole left by the collapse of communism, he now seems to have absorbed them — and acted upon them.There is prepared soil for such ideas in Russia, which has been torn for centuries between “Westernizers” and those who see the West as a cancer — alien, decadent, insidious and threatening.Western Europeans coped differently with their own failed empires, combining their weakened nation-states into the European Union, in part to constrain aggressive nationalism. “The European Union was the transformation of empires that failed, desperate to find something new,” said Pierre Vimont, a former French ambassador to the United States now at Carnegie Europe — something safer and less prone to war.  Mr. Putin’s concept of a nation is an ethnic and autocratic one, in contrast to the Western idea of a multicultural state built on civic responsibility, the rule of law and individual rights. To be an American, many have suggested, it is necessary simply to swear allegiance to the flag, obey the law and pay your taxes.  Efforts to more narrowly define what it is to be a “true American” have fed into a far-right populism, and in former President Trump’s praise of Mr. Putin there are elements of identification with a strong leader defending “traditional” — and restrictive — definitions of national belonging.But as with the far right in European countries like Germany, France and Italy, association with Mr. Putin now, during his war of aggression in Ukraine, is an embarrassing reminder of where such views can lead.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.China, the other great autocracy in the Biden formulation, is built on similar ideas of ethnic nationalism — that all Chinese are part of the same nation, that minorities like the Uyghurs are inferior or dangerous, and that Taiwan’s separation is illusory, a crime of history that must be repaired.Even India, a great democracy, has been pushed into ethnic nationalism by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with his Hindu ascendancy. In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has recreated historical tales of the Ottoman Empire while acting in solidarity with Turkic-speaking peoples in Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh and in Central Asia.In Europe, too, Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, has promoted Hungarian identity and nationalism despite censure from Brussels. He has handed out Hungarian passports to ethnic Hungarians in Romania and other countries, who are allowed to vote in Hungary, giving him, so far, an electoral edge. But Mr. Orban faces parliamentary elections next month, and his long, close relations with Mr. Putin have hurt him politically, even as he has moved quickly to support European Union sanctions on Russia and welcome Ukrainian refugees.  Mr. Putin’s ethno-nationalist war has not gone particularly well, apparently to his surprise, unfolding as a bloody slog rather than a swift triumph. Casting it as a civilizational war creates all kinds of difficulties for Russian invaders — after all, if Russians and Ukrainians are one people, as Mr. Putin insists, they are firing on their brothers and sisters.  “It’s not easy for those kids to kill Ukrainians, who share the language and look like them,” Mr. Krastev said. “It was easier with the Chechens,’’ the non-Slavic people of the Caucasus whom Russia has been fighting since Catherine the Great.Mr. Putin’s great disappointment, said Mr. Krastev, was to discover that Russian speakers in Ukraine fought his forces. Even his favorite Ukrainian oligarchs, like Rinat Akhmetov and Dmytro Firtash, “have suddenly discovered Ukrainian-ness.”Mr. Putin has also worked to build a more militaristic society, based on Russia’s pride in its defeat of Nazi Germany in what is called “The Great Patriotic War.” But now Ukraine, which also fought and suffered under the Nazis, is using the same tropes against the invading Russians. For Ukraine, Mr. Krastev said, “this is their Great Patriotic War.”Mr. Putin has done more to build Ukrainian nationhood than anyone in the West could have done, Mr. Krastev said. “Putin wanted to be the father of a new Russian nation, but he is the father of a new Ukrainian nation instead.” "
Imagining Peace in Ukrain,2022-03-16 17:12:00+00:00,"Vladimir Putin’s history makes it hard to imagine a peace agreement in which an independent Ukraine continues to exist.Consider the obstacles: Putin views Ukraine as a natural part of greater Russia. To control it, he has at his disposal a military vastly stronger than Ukraine’s. He has also demonstrated — in Chechnya and Syria — that he will kill large numbers of civilians to achieve his aims. In Ukraine, Putin seems willing to spend months if not years fighting a brutal war over a place that matters more to him than to the rest of the world.But if it is hard to imagine his accepting some version of defeat, it is not impossible. It would probably involve his deciding that the war was becoming too costly — that it threatened the rest of his priorities and perhaps even his position as Russia’s authoritarian leader.This kind of cost is exactly what the U.S., E.U., Britain and Ukraine’s other allies are trying to impose on Putin. How might they plausibly succeed? Today’s newsletter considers that question, through four main points.  Putin “probably wants all of Ukraine,” Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution has written. “Then again, he may now be appreciating the huge costs he will pay for any such conquest, and be open to settling for lesser objectives.”1. The goalPutin has been a destructive force in the world for much of his two decades in power. He annexed the Crimean peninsula and abused Chechnya and Syria. He has used his power to enrich himself. His regime has murdered journalists, human rights activists and political opponents. In the U.S. and Europe, Putin has used misinformation to influence elections.For all these reasons, many U.S. and European officials would like to see Putin forced from power. But ending the war in Ukraine — and allowing Ukraine to survive as a nation — does not require regime change in Russia. And if Putin’s ouster is the goal, the chances of success become even smaller.“There’s loose talk by people now about, well, this will only end if Putin disappears,” Fiona Hill, the Russia expert and former White House official, told our colleague Ezra Klein. “This just feeds into this mentality that Russia is always under siege, its leaders are always under siege, people always want regime change in Russia.”Putin might at some point be willing to give up Ukraine. He probably will not be willing to give up Russia.  2. SanctionsHistorically, economic sanctions have often failed to change the behavior of the country that they targeted. But they have not always failed. In the 20th century, sanctions achieved at least part of their aim about one-third of the time, according to Nicholas Mulder, a Cornell University historian. One key is connecting them to clearly defined goals.The sanctions on Russia are some of the most aggressive ever levied, with the potential to stoke public unhappiness. Russian banks will have a harder time lending money. Russian companies will struggle to import some goods and technologies. Russian consumers will no longer be able to use Mastercard or Visa, buy Coke or Pepsi and shop at McDonald’s, Starbucks or Uniqlo. The ruble has fallen in value, raising the cost of many items.Crucially, the U.S. and its allies are going after Russian oligarchs with a new seriousness. The measures imposed after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 proved to be ineffectual, as our colleagues Matt Apuzzo and Jane Bradley explain in a new investigative story. “But just as 9/11 forced world leaders to get serious about terrorist money,” Matt and Jane write, “the recent invasion of Ukraine could be a turning point on tackling illicit Russian wealth.”The oligarchs are among the few Russians who might have some sway over Putin. “We know that Putin relies on people close to him to hide his money,” Tom Keatinge, a financial crime expert, told The Times.  3. WeaponsWestern Europe and the U.S. have been unwilling to send troops to Ukraine. In part, Western leaders are worried about setting off a larger war, even a nuclear one. In part, the leaders have decided that Ukraine is not worth the deaths of their own citizens (even if they won’t quite say so). Polls suggest that the American public, at least, agrees.But military help for Ukraine is not simply a yes-or-no question. The U.S. and other countries have already sent weapons and equipment. When Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, speaks to the U.S. Congress by video today, he may ask for fighter jets. (Here’s The Morning’s recent profile of Zelensky.)  The White House announced yesterday that President Biden would attend an impromptu NATO meeting next week in Brussels, where leaders are likely to discuss both economic sanctions on Russia and weapons assistance for Ukraine. Biden is also planning to announce an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine.4. A deal’s frameworkSome peace deals would probably be unacceptable to Ukraine — say, a rump state in the western part of the country that does not include Kyiv. Other potential deals are more plausible.Thomas Friedman, the Times columnist, has laid out the outlines of a possible deal in which Russia acquires a portion of eastern Ukraine where fighting has been going on for years; Ukraine promises not to join NATO (as Zelensky has already hinted); and Russia pays compensation for the damage it has done.None of this looks likely right now. Russia continues to bombard civilian areas and claims it now controls the entire Kherson region, bordering Crimea in southern Ukraine. But unlikely is not the same thing as impossible. Ukraine’s demise would be so damaging — both for Ukrainians and for the state of democracy — that its allies have good reason to search for alternatives.A less pessimistic view: “Russia is heading for an outright defeat in Ukraine,” Francis Fukuyama writes in American Purpose. “The army in the field will reach a point where it can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will vaporize.”State of the War  As Russia struggles to capture major cities, it has intensified its assaults on civilian areas, including in Kyiv.Three European leaders visited Ukraine yesterday, as Russian bombardments intensified. Zelensky urged other leaders to do the same.“It is here that freedom fights against the world of tyranny,” Poland’s prime minister wrote on Facebook after arriving in Kyiv by train.There was some relief in the besieged city of Mariupol: An estimated 20,000 people fled after Russia and Ukraine opened a humanitarian corridor.Putin cast doubt on prospects for a breakthrough in peace talks after yesterday’s negotiations.More on UkraineTwo journalists working for Fox News were killed when their vehicle came under fire outside Kyiv.Overflowing morgues and daily shelling: This is life inside Mykolaiv, a port city where residents refuse to give in.Technicians trapped inside Chernobyl are working around the clock at gunpoint to safeguard the nuclear waste, The Wall Street Journal reports.The Ukrainian anthem is reverberating around the world.

Ukraine Seeks Tougher Sanctions at Russian Port,2022-03-17 18:05:14+00:00,"Oil tankers from around the world, including several chartered by U.S.-based companies, are continuing to transport millions of barrels of oil out of Russian ports, a top adviser to Ukraine’s president said, as he made a plea to the White House to restrict all trade in Russian oil by American companies.In an interview from Kyiv overnight on Tuesday, Oleg Ustenko, an economic adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, also urged the chief executives of Western oil and gas companies to pledge to not handle oil from Russia, and to hire independent accounting firms to verify that no Russian oil is being loaded onto their ships.“We’re talking about supplying Russia with bloody money that they’re using to feed a military machine that is killing my people,” Mr. Ustenko said. “We need a full embargo, a full boycott. All Russian ports must be closed.”Complicating the picture is the fact that one of Russia’s major oil terminals, the port of Novorossiysk, on the Black Sea, is a hub for a pipeline that carries oil from neighboring Kazakhstan that is blended with Russian oil, according to the pipeline’s operators. Experts say that can make it difficult to pinpoint the oil’s origin.  The continued oil trade out of places like Novorossiysk — much of it with Europe, which is heavily reliant on oil and gas imports from Russia — highlights the loopholes that allow Russian producers to continue to export their oil, Mr. Ustenko said, and even profit from high global oil prices, which rose sharply after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Mr. Ustenko said American companies were abetting that trade. He cited as an example a tanker chartered by Chevron, the U.S. oil giant, which left Novorossiysk on Friday carrying nearly 100,000 tons of crude and is currently en route to the Netherlands. According to independent shipment data, the tanker, the Mediterranean Voyager, is carrying a crude oil blend.Separate data gathered by Ukraine on ships contracted to load oil at Russian ports in the next two weeks included at least five other Chevron-chartered tankers.In a statement, Chevron said the oil aboard the ship originated in Kazakhstan and that the company’s “efforts are carried out in compliance with U.S. law.” The company added that “access to Kazakh energy supplies remains very important for consumers around the world.” Chevron also said it did not have exploration or production operations in Russia.  President Biden banned new U.S. imports of Russian oil, gas and coal in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But those rules don’t prohibit the shipping of oil, Russian or otherwise, from Russian ports to destinations in other nations. Still, Mr. Ustenko said the trade violated the spirit of the embargo and he urged the White House to ban American companies from handling Russian oil and gas exports, regardless of destination.Biden administration officials have stressed that Washington’s restrictions go much further than those of other nations, including major U.S. allies in Europe, which have yet to cease energy imports. Europe is particularly reliant on Russian gas, and could face debilitating energy shortages if it cut off all supply. Much of the world has also placed severe financial restrictions on Moscow.A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said the United States was able to put in place its fossil-fuel embargo, in addition to an array of other restrictions on Russian business activity, “because of our strong domestic energy infrastructure” and that it would deprive Russian President Vladimir V. Putin of the resources he needed to wage war in Ukraine. But Washington also recognizes “that not all of our allies and partners are currently in a position to join us,” she said.  In recent days, numerous Western oil and gas companies have also said that they will cease operations in Russia, including abandoning joint ventures with state-owned producers. And some large carriers have said they will no longer transport Russian oil or gas, and traders have reported dwindling takers.Still, Ukraine estimates that Russian ports will continue to ship out at least 1.5 million barrels of crude oil and other oil-based products a day in the coming weeks — a significant decline from the four to five million barrels of crude they typically handled before the invasion, when Russian producers were earning about $700 million a day from both oil and gas. Oil, gas and coal make up the vast majority of Russia’s exports.Mr. Ustenko criticized Greek shipping companies, in particular, which he said own many of the tankers that continued to transport oil from Russian ports. He called on the Greek government to ban those shipments, and he also called on the German government to lead the European Union toward a physical oil boycott and to stop paying Russia for gas, instead putting funds into an escrow account to be paid once Russia sued for peace.  Simon Johnson, an economics professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said those shipments exposed a major weakness in the U.S. embargo by allowing Russians to take advantage of higher oil prices and “get a windfall gain on their trade.”Understand the Latest News on Climate ChangeCard 1 of 4Ice shelf collapses.

The 450-square-mile ice shelf was located in an area known as Wilkes Land; the loss occurred in mid-March.A massive leak. Startlingly large amounts of methane are leaking from wells and pipelines in New Mexico’s Permian Basin, according to a new analysis of aerial data, suggesting that the oil and gas industry may be contributing more to climate change than was previously known.Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. A wide stretch of the Great Barrier Reef has been hit by a sixth mass bleaching event, an alarming indicator that the area is under intense stress from the waters around them, which have been growing steadily warmer as a result of climate change..Enduring drought. Drought conditions are likely to continue across more than half of the continental United States through at least June, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Nearly 60 percent of the continental United States is experiencing drought.To stem that trade, Washington needed to impose full sanctions — similar to those currently imposed on Iran — that would ban U.S.-based companies from all trade with Russia. “The only way to deal with that is to make sure they export nothing,” Mr. Johnson said. “It’s not complicated.”Energy experts have warned the blended oil from the pipeline at Novorossiysk could potentially provide a route allowing Russian producers to continue to get oil out to global markets with the product’s origins obscured. According to the pipeline’s operators, over the past two decades it typically carried a blend of about 13 percent Russian oil. The consortium that owns the pipeline is 24 percent owned by the Russian state.Agnia Grigas, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and an expert on energy and geopolitics in Eastern Europe, said the spirit of the U.S. import ban should already impede American companies from doing trade in that oil. “It’s near impossible to distinguish the origin of the oil particles,” she said.“If that oil was bought from Russian traders, the implications are the same,” she added, because the net effect would be that Russian traders would be making a profit from the transactions.Biden administration officials have said that while the United States has tried to lead by example, it has refrained from disrupting other countries’ energy needs, for example by banning U.S. companies from delivering Russian oil to those nations.The turmoil in oil and gas markets has spurred calls for a more rapid transition to renewables like wind and solar power. Mr. Ustenko said that the crisis could ultimately spur more investment in green energy. “In the long run, everybody is going to benefit,” he said.  Public censure of companies that continue to trade with Russia has been swift. Earlier this month, Royal Dutch Shell bought a shipment of Russian oil at a heavy discount of just under $30 per barrel and was forced to quickly pledge not to make future purchases.In a televised address in Ukraine on Tuesday, President Zelensky made an appeal to people worldwide to boycott Russian products. “Everything is in your power,” he said. “All business with Russia must be stopped.” On Wednesday he made a direct appeal to the United States Congress by video.

ur Wednesday Briefing,2022-03-16 16:50:43.840000+00:00,"European leaders visit a Kyiv in flamesThe leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia traveled to Kyiv, Ukraine’s besieged capital, in a defiant show of support yesterday, even as a relentless Russian artillery bombardment left apartment towers in the city ablaze, forcing terrified residents to flee into the street with only the clothes on their backs. Follow the latest updates.The dramatic visit, which unfolded in secrecy, caught other European leaders off guard, angering some and baring uncomfortable divisions in how best to demonstrate Western solidarity with Ukraine. President Biden has announced his own plans to travel to Europe next week to showcase the unity of the NATO alliance in the face of Russian aggression.But for all the symbolism of Europe’s leaders standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine under the threat of Russia’s rockets, the country is facing the devastating barrage largely on its own. Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, repeated his plea for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. “It is an attempt to destroy our future, our nation, our character.”Capitol Hill: The crisis in Ukraine is upending policy and political thinking on both the left and the right, empowering the political center. Zelensky will address Congress today at 9 a.m. Eastern time in a virtual speech that could increase pressure on the Biden administration to send fighter jets to Kyiv.

A refugee crisis threatens Europe’s strained economyMore than three million refugees have fled Ukraine in less than three weeks, according to the U.N. International Organization for Migration, and millions more are likely to follow. Though many hope to return home, it is unclear whether such quick turnabouts will be possible — one of many uncertainties hanging over Europe’s fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II.What happens over the next few months will determine if Europe will face the additional costs of a huge resettlement that has the potential to reshape the economic landscape. Some early estimates put that bill at $30 billion in the first year alone. And over the long term, the expense of integrating millions of people may put immense strain on social systems, even as these workers are likely to increase a nation’s output over time.While rights advocates say the moral urgency of helping save lives and keep families together outweighs the costs, European economies are still recovering from the pandemic and coping with stubborn supply chain shortages and high inflation. Roughly 13 million people were unemployed in the E.U. in January. Those costs will affect how Europeans live and could raise pressure on leaders to find an end to the crisis.  Plans to return: Officials, migration experts and economists say it is too early to determine whether most displaced Ukrainians will end up staying in Europe. Of the 431,000 Ukrainians who have crossed into Romania, for example, only 3,800 have asked for asylum.  Pfizer seeks authorization of a second booster shotPfizer and BioNTech said that they had sought emergency authorization in the U.S. for a second booster shot of their coronavirus vaccine for adults 65 and older, based on data from Israel, where such shots are authorized for a somewhat broader group.The request comes amid a tortuous debate among scientists over when and how often the vaccines’ protection should be bolstered, and for whom. Some public health experts opposed booster shots for the general population altogether and only changed their minds because of the Omicron variant.Some officials say that a fourth shot for all older Americans may make sense now but that the general population should probably wait until the fall. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to convene a meeting of its expert advisory committee next month to discuss the issue of fourth shots.Justification: Recent studies from Israel, which have not yet been peer reviewed, found that those who got a fourth dose of Pfizer’s vaccine were less likely to become infected with the virus or to develop severe illness than those who had received just three doses. But it was too early to say how long that protection would last.  Quotable: “The protection that you are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chief executive. “It’s not that good against infections.”Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.In other developments:In Africa, Covid vaccines are now plentiful, but in the poorest countries, they arrive in a hodgepodge that makes planning difficult.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine appears more effective than previously believed.Britain will lift its remaining international travel restrictions this week, one of the first major economies to do so.Oil prices dropped below $100 per barrel as Covid outbreaks in China threatened demand from the world’s largest oil importer.THE LATEST NEWSAround the World  The once-perilous highway between Afghanistan’s two largest cities, still dotted with destroyed vehicles and bullet-riddled homes, has come back to life under the Taliban.Impunity for war crimes in Syria bodes poorly for future measures against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.A top court in India upheld a government order barring Muslim girls from wearing head scarves inside schools, a ruling that is likely to heighten tensions between Muslims and Hindus.The son of Turkmenistan’s leader won the country’s presidential election after an unusual vote-counting delay.Other Big Stories  Intel will spend at least $19 billion to begin to manufacture chips in the German city of Magdeburg, continuing an expansion aimed at reducing its dependence on Asian factories.Sept. 11 prosecutors are considering a plea deal for Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the terrorist attacks.Ticket sales for domestic U.S. flights in February exceeded those for the same month in 2019, the first such increase since the pandemic began.What Else Is HappeningDaylight saving time might become permanent in the U.S., as senators passed legislation that would eliminate the biannual ritual of springing forward and falling back.Anna Sorokin, who posed as an heiress to swindle elites under the pseudonym Anna Delvey, will be deported from the U.S. to Germany.For the first time since 1940, Rockefeller Plaza in New York City will have a roller rink.A Morning Read  Swiss cartographers are especially busy these days.

Zelensky Urges More Leaders to Visit Kyiv After Visit by 3 NATO Lead,2022-03-16 13:21:03.379000+00:00,"President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the leaders of three NATO member countries who traveled into Ukraine’s war-torn capital for an extraordinary meeting on Tuesday and urged others to do the same.The leaders from Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia who traveled to Kyiv “fear nothing,” Mr. Zelensky said after the meeting, adding, “I am sure that with such friends, with such countries, with such neighbors and partners, we will really be able to win.”The leaders discussed not only increasing sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, but also “plans to rebuild our country after the end of hostilities,” Mr. Zelensky’s office said, projecting an air of confidence despite a brutal campaign that has already driven more than two million Ukrainians to seek refuge in neighboring countries.Mr. Zelensky has sought to rally international support through nightly videos that he posts on social media, as well as virtual meetings with world leaders — including a speech to U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday.  But Tuesday’s meeting in Kyiv, was a rare in-person gathering for Mr. Zelensky and outside leaders. So far, the fighting has been focused in the suburbs of the capital as the military prepares to defend Kyiv from a possible assault. At least one attendee wore a green protective vest while sitting at the table with Mr. Zelensky, according to a photograph posted on the president’s official website.Mr. Zelensky also invited other world leaders to join him in Kyiv, and once again pressed allies to enforce a no-fly zone over the country, which they have resisted out of concerns of being drawn into a direct conflict with Russia.“I invite all friends of Ukraine to visit Kyiv,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement posted on his official Telegram channel. “It can be dangerous here. Because our sky is not yet closed to Russian missiles and planes.”He added: “You know for sure that the eyes of all the people of the world are now focused on our capital, on Ukrainians.” "
"th Korea’s Projectile Launch Fails, South Korea Say",2022-03-16 07:20:04+00:00,"SEOUL — North Korea launched an unidentified projectile on Wednesday, but it apparently failed “immediately after liftoff,” the South Korean military said.The projectile was launched at 9:30 a.m. from Sunan, outside Pyongyang, the capital, the South Korean military said in a brief statement. But the rocket exploded midair after reaching an altitude of less than 12 miles, South Korean defense officials said.The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the launch was a “ballistic missile” test and called on North Korea to “refrain from further destabilizing acts.”The North launched ballistic missiles from the same site at Sunan on Feb. 27 and March 5, American and South Korean officials said. North Korea said those tests had been part of its preparation to launch a military reconnaissance satellite — a task that its leader, Kim Jong-un, assigned to his government during a Workers’ Party congress in January last year.  But Washington and Seoul later said that North Korea had actually been conducting scaled-down tests of its new Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile under the disguise of launching a satellite. The Hwasong-17, the North’s largest known I.C.B.M., was first unveiled during a military parade in October 2020 but had never been tested before.North Korea has conducted 10 missile or projectile tests so far this year, more than in all of last year. But the isolated country has often failed in its missile tests, especially when it has been developing a new weapon.The last failure of a missile launch was reported in August 2017, when one of three short-range ballistic missiles launched by the North blew up immediately after liftoff.The launch on Wednesday came as the United States and its allies watched Sunan closely amid signs that North Korea was preparing to fire another missile from the site. The Pentagon had said that the North’s earlier tests there were to evaluate the Hwasong-17 system “before conducting a test at full range in the future, potentially disguised as a space launch.”The U.N. Security Council has banned North Korea from launching a rocket to place a satellite into orbit because the country has used such rockets to develop its long-range ballistic missiles.  It was unclear whether the launch on Wednesday was another preparatory test or a full-range launch. In the earlier tests, the missiles flew 168 to 186 miles. Missile experts said that in those tests, North Korea most likely had tested its first-stage booster rocket for the three-stage Hwasong-17 I.C.B.M.In anticipation of the launch, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command ordered intensified surveillance in the Yellow Sea between China and the Korean Peninsula, as well as enhanced readiness among its ballistic missile defense forces in the region.This week, the Seventh Fleet of the U.S. Navy said that aircraft taking off from the USS Abraham Lincoln had conducted a drill in the Yellow Sea. The United States military command in South Korea also said it had conducted a missile defense exercise. "
"In Reversal, Guatemala Shelves Anti-Abortion La",2022-03-16 00:29:31+00:00,"GUATEMALA CITY — Guatemala’s congress on Tuesday shelved a bill that would have imposed up to 10 years of jail time for women who obtained abortions, an abrupt reversal that follows days of protests, legal challenges and widespread disapproval of the measure, including from a prominent anti-abortion group.The U.S. government also expressed serious concerns about enacting the legislation, which also banned same-sex marriage, in back-channel conversations with the Guatemalan government, according to two American officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive policy matters.The country’s president, Alejandro Giammattei, said he would veto the bill days after his allies pushed it through the legislature, a move that surprised analysts, human rights activists and Guatemalan officials.On March 9, the day after the bill passed, Mr. Giammattei attended a ceremony declaring Guatemala the “pro-life capital” of Latin America, where he said in a speech that he believed “in respect for life from the moment of conception.”  But by Thursday, the president was distancing himself from the bill. In a short video address, Mr. Giammattei said the anti-abortion ceremony should not be linked to the legislature’s approval of the anti-abortion measure, which he said “suffers from technical deficiencies” and “violates the constitution of the republic.”Officials and human rights activists say the reversal was probably prompted by the immediate backlash to the approval of the bill at home and abroad, which made signing it politically risky for Guatemala’s profoundly unpopular president.The bill, approved by the legislature last week, on International Women’s Day, would have imposed among the harshest penalties for abortion of any country in Latin America and likely would have blocked any movement on L.G.B.T.Q. rights. It would have prohibited teaching students about sexual diversity or that gay or lesbian sex is “normal,” and barred schools from discussing L.G.B.T.Q. issues with children.“We expected the president to align himself with the law,” said Regina Tamés, the deputy director of the women’s rights division at Human Rights Watch. “He’s a president that has done little to nothing to protect human rights in general, and much less those of women and L.G.B.T. people.”In a country where abortion is already illegal in every case except when a woman’s life is at risk, the move to further restrict access to the procedure was immediately met with outrage by human rights groups.  In demonstrations that gathered momentum over several days, women, L.G.B.T.Q. activists and university students gathered in front of Congress to protest the bill. On Saturday, hundreds marched through the capital, with a small group of protesters setting fire to a Guatemalan flag outside the National Palace and chanting that the bill “does not represent me.”Even the Family Matters Association, one of the largest anti-abortion organizations in Guatemala, came out against the measure, urging Mr. Giammattei to consider the danger of ratifying a law that “could put fundamental rights and guarantees at risk.”The Issue of Abortion Around the WorldCard 1 of 8An evolving landscape. Women’s access to abortion continues to be debated around the globe. Here’s a look at the state of affairs in some countries:Colombia. The country’s top court decriminalized abortion in 2022, making it the third major Latin American nation to allow access to the procedure. The decision paves the way for abortions to become widely available across this historically conservative, Catholic country.Guatemala. After lawmakers passed a sweeping new bill mandating up to 10 years of jail time for women who obtain abortions, protests erupted. A few days later, in an abrupt reversal that surprised analysts, President Alejandro Giammattei said he would veto the bill.Mexico. In 2021, Mexico’s Supreme Court issued a historic decision that decriminalized abortion. The move set a legal precedent for the nation, but applying it to all of Mexico’s states will be a long path, and several challenges remain.Poland. The country is one of the few that has moved to restrict abortion in recent years. A near-total ban went into effect in January 2021, fueling discontent among those who believe human freedoms are being eroded under the increasingly autocratic Law and Justice Party.China. The country’s central government said last Septemberthat it intended to reduce the prevalence of “medically unnecessary” abortions. In recent years, China has been focusing its efforts toward promoting childbirth and slowing the population’s aging.Thailand. The Thai Parliament voted in 2021 to make abortion legal in the first trimester, while keeping penalties in place for women who undergo it later in their pregnancies. Advocates say the measure doesn’t go far enough.Argentina. In 2020, the country became the largest nation in Latin America to legalize abortion — a landmark vote in a conservative region and a victory for a grass-roots movement that turned years of rallies into political power.Mr. Giammattei has seen his approval ratings sink since taking office in 2020, surveys show. Nearly two-thirds of respondents in a recent CID-Gallup survey said his performance was “bad or very bad” — the worst rating of the last 10 presidents in Guatemala, according to the analysis.The Guatemalan leader has been implicated in two corruption cases, and his attorney general has ratcheted up tension with the Biden administration by targeting judges and former prosecutors.“The president needed to do something to reduce the demonstrations, lest they get out of control,” said Congresswoman Lucrecia Hernández Mack, who voted against the law. “He was probably scared that this was going to get louder because it generated a lot of outrage on social media and in the streets.”A group of lawyers filed a legal challenge to the bill with the country’s constitutional court, and opposition lawmakers sent formal objections to the president of Congress. The lawmakers pointed out particular problems with part of the measure that requires a physician to get the approval of another doctor before performing an abortion to save the life of a mother.Guatemala has about one doctor for every 1,000 people, the members of Congress said, which would make it extremely difficult for women at risk of maternal death to receive an abortion under the law.

Russian Bombardment of Kyiv Continues While European Leaders Visit ,2022-03-16 03:45:02+00:00,"LONDON — Three European leaders staged a defiant show of support for Ukraine on Tuesday, traveling to its besieged capital, Kyiv, even as a relentless Russian artillery bombardment left apartment towers in the city ablaze, forcing terrified residents to flee into the street with only the clothes on their backs.The dramatic visit by the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, which unfolded in tight secrecy as they crossed the Ukrainian border by train after dawn, was a strikingly personal gesture. But it caught other European leaders off guard, angering some and baring uncomfortable divisions in how best to demonstrate Western solidarity with Ukraine.It also came as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia disparaged the second consecutive day of negotiations with Ukraine, undercutting the faint glimmers of hope raised from talks the day before that both sides were looking for a way to halt the war.  The Kremlin slapped retaliatory sanctions on President Biden and other senior American officials. Mr. Biden announced his own plans to travel to Europe next week to showcase the unity of the NATO alliance in the face of Russian aggression.  A spokesman for Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the three visitors were “de facto” representing the European Union in Ukraine. In Brussels, however, officials said the trio did not have the E.U.’s blessing, and some European diplomats complained that the trip was too risky, given the Russian forces encircling Kyiv.Others said they admired the audacity of the group, which also included Prime Minister Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic and Prime Minister Janez Jansa of Slovenia, casting it as a powerful symbol of the backing for Ukraine among countries on Europe’s eastern flank, where the specter of Russian aggression looms larger than in Paris or London.Still, for all the symbolism of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine’s leaders under the threat of Russia’s rockets, Ukraine was facing the devastating barrage largely on its own. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, imposed a 35-hour curfew, starting on Tuesday evening, which suggested the capital was entering an even more difficult phase of its grinding struggle to hold off Russian troops and tanks.  “This is their attempt to annihilate the Ukrainian people,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an emotional video address to the Canadian Parliament, repeating his plea for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. “It is an attempt to destroy our future, our nation, our character.”Mr. Zelensky asked the lawmakers to imagine if the CN Tower in Toronto were shelled like the towers in Kyiv. His language has become more pointed, even scolding, with each speech to a Western audience, revealing his frustration with leaders who have resisted more direct military involvement out of fear that it would entangle them in a wider conflict with Russia.The Ukrainian leader, who has become a hero to many in the West, is scheduled to speak via video to Congress on Wednesday, where he is expected to amplify his pleas for more help and increase the pressure on the United States and its allies.Mr. Biden is planning to announce $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday, according to White House officials. The administration last week announced $200 million in security assistance for Ukraine and has made available a total of $2 billion in such funding.On Tuesday evening, the Polish state broadcaster carried video of the Czech, Slovene and Polish leaders meeting Mr. Zelensky and other officials across a long table, with Ukraine’s blue-and-yellow flag behind them.  “They are here to support us,” Mr. Zelensky said at a news briefing after the meeting, which also was shown on Ukrainian television. “It is a great, courageous, right, friendly step. I am confident that with such friends, such countries and neighbors and partners, we can really win.”  A photograph posted earlier on Mr. Morawiecki’s Twitter account showed the three men poring over a map, seated in what appeared to be a train carriage en route to the Ukrainian capital.“It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made,” Mr. Morawiecki said in the Twitter post. “It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance.”The White House announced that Mr. Biden would fly to Brussels for an extraordinary summit meeting of NATO on March 24. That may result in further economic and military aid for Ukraine but will likely fall short of Mr. Zelensky’s request for a no-fly zone. Administration officials declined to say whether Mr. Biden planned to meet with the Ukrainian president, whom he has called a hero. But they said Mr. Biden may go on to somewhere in Eastern Europe to meet with refugees streaming out of Ukraine.The river of people fleeing the war continued unabated on Tuesday, as Russia claimed to have seized control of the strategic Kherson region in the south. Russian forces kept up their pounding of civilian targets in Kyiv, where Ukrainian troops were fortifying intersections with sandbags, tires, and iron spikes.  A pre-dawn rain of rockets on Kyiv shattered windows, left craters in buildings, and turned a 16-floor apartment house into a towering inferno. The fire spread quickly after a missile struck the building, blowing a jagged hole at its entrance. Firefighters rescued residents from windows by ladder through billowing smoke. By midafternoon, they had carried out two bodies encased in black bags.“I came out with nothing,” said Mykola Fedkiv, 85, a retired geologist. “I left everything, my telephone, my medicines, everything.”  When the missile struck, Mr. Fedkiv fled his 12th-floor apartment and made his way down the stairs. He climbed through the blasted entrance hall and found himself in the bomb crater. People pulled him out by his arms. He stood outside for hours, hoping to re-enter his apartment to collect personal documents. Asked where he planned to stay the night, he responded, “God knows.”  Conditions were even more desperate in the coastal city of Mariupol, which has been pummeled by Russian forces in a two-week siege that has left some residents crushed in the rubble and many others dying in a winter freeze with no heat, food, or clean water. Officials can no longer account for the number of dead and missing.Officially, 2,400 civilians killed in Mariupol have been identified, but Pyotr Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city government, said he believed the toll was far higher, possibly as many as 20,000. Ukrainian estimates of the number of people trapped have ranged from 200,000 to 400,000.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.Mr. Andryushchenko said 2,000 vehicles had managed to escape Mariupol on Tuesday and that another 2,000 were packed and ready to leave. Officials told civilians to “delete all messages and photos from phones” in case Russian soldiers searched them for signs of support for Ukrainian forces.  The perils of reporting accurate information from Ukraine’s combat zones were further underscored Tuesday with news that a Fox News cameraman and a Ukrainian colleague had been killed in an attack on Monday outside Kyiv — raising to at least three the number of journalist fatalities in Ukraine in the past few days.  In Kherson, a southern city under Russian occupation, the mayor said that members of Russia’s national guard were rounding up activists who opposed Russia’s presence, possibly trying to recruit them through coercion.“They’re all in the city, in the jail,” the mayor, Igor Kolykhaev, wrote in several text messages, referring to the activists. Russian troops, he said, “collect them, hold them, work them over and release them.”Kherson was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the Feb. 24 start of the invasion. Although Kremlin officials had predicted that the Ukrainian people would welcome their “liberation” by Russian troops, residents of Kherson have been defiant, regularly gathering in the central square to protest the Russian presence, even when Russian troops fire into the air to disperse them.Russia claimed to have captured the entire Kherson region, potentially strengthening its ability to push west toward the strategic port cities of Mykolaiv and Odessa. A senior Ukrainian military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Russian forces were in control of much of the Kherson region, but said Ukrainian forces were attacking their positions and inflicting losses.Negotiations via video link between Russia and Ukraine continued for a second day on Tuesday, though Mr. Putin doused prospects of any imminent breakthrough. In a phone call with the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, Mr. Putin complained that “Kyiv is not demonstrating a serious attitude toward finding mutually acceptable solutions,” according to the Kremlin.  Mr. Putin also continued to struggle in the information battle with Ukraine. On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron of France said his country could offer diplomatic “protection” to a Russian state television employee who was detained and fined over an on-air antiwar protest on Monday.  The employee, Marina Ovsyannikova, burst onto the live broadcast of Russia’s most-watched news program on Monday evening, yelling, “Stop the war!” and holding a sign that read, “They’re lying to you here.”Russia also faced further isolation from Britain, which imposed sanctions on more than 370 people it labeled oligarchs, political allies of, or propagandists for Mr. Putin. Among those blacklisted: Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president of Russia; Mikhail Mishustin, the current prime minister; and Mikhail Fridman, the billionaire founder of Alfa Bank, one of the country’s largest private banks.  Russia, for its part, said it had sanctioned 13 Americans including Mr. Biden, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III in response to American sanctions against Mr. Putin and other officials. Also on its list was Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.Mr. Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, shrugged off the news, suggesting in jest that the Kremlin’s announcement might have missed its intended mark. The president, Ms. Psaki said, is a “junior, so they might have sanctioned his dad by mistake.”Mark Landler reported from London, and Matina Stevis-Gridneff from Brussels.

ur Wednesday Briefing: E.U. Leaders Visit Kyiv,2022-03-15 22:37:23.156000+00:00,"Good morning. We’re covering a visit by three European leaders to Ukraine, the ripple effects of China’s surge of Covid cases and a once-perilous road in Afghanistan.  Three European leaders head to UkraineThe prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia traveled by train to Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, on Tuesday to express the European Union’s support for Ukraine. Next week, President Biden will travel to Brussels to attend a special NATO meeting about the war.The Tuesday visit comes as fighting raged around the city. Blasts shook Kyiv at dawn, killing at least four people, the mayor said. Follow live updates here.Russia’s advance remains stalled on several fronts as Ukrainian forces repel attacks in parts of the east and the south. But the Russian Defense Ministry claimed to have captured the entire Kherson region, after seizing the main city two weeks ago.Ukrainian resistance: The move possibly strengthens Russia’s ability to push west toward Mykolaiv, a strategic port city where the morgue is already overflowing. Our correspondent and photographer reported from Mykolaiv on a “refusal to succumb” by Ukrainian fighters and residents.  The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, predicted that any Russian effort to take Mykolaiv would lead to a bloody firefight. Residents have piled tires and incendiary bombs on every street corner. It would be apocalyptic, Kim said.More updates:Talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators resumed on Tuesday, presenting a narrow path to a diplomatic resolution. China’s top diplomat urged international support for the talks.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine will address the U.S. Congress in a virtual speech today.India said it is in talks with Russia about increasing oil imports.As evacuations from Mariupol continue, officials there are struggling to count the dead, which officially number close to 2,400.The Russian government might pay foreign debt obligations in rubles because of sanctions. Credit rating agencies say a default is imminent.  China’s Covid surge hits oil pricesOil prices dropped below $100 a barrel on Tuesday, the lowest prices in weeks, as a coronavirus outbreak in China threatened to slow the country’s economy and decrease global demand. Over the past week, crude oil prices have plunged by more than 20 percent, reversing much of the surge that came after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The global economic harm caused by China’s rise in Covid cases — and the government’s tough response — could soon get worse. Numerous lockdowns and mitigation tactics have disrupted the production of goods like cars, iPhone circuit boards and computer cables.  Context: China’s strict measures come as some other nations in the Asia-Pacific region are easing pandemic rules, despite seeing some of the world’s steepest spikes in Covid cases.Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.In other developments:In Africa, Covid vaccines are now plentiful, but in the poorest countries, they arrive in a hodgepodge that makes planning difficult.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine appears more effective than previously believed.Britain will lift its remaining international travel restrictions this week, one of the first major economies to do so.Australia said it would lift its ban on cruise ships next month.  A once-deadly road now bustlesBefore the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, a trip along the road from Kabul to Kandahar was dangerous. Gunfire, roadside bombs, extortion and death were once rampant.Not anymore. The highway between the country’s two largest cities, still dotted with destroyed vehicles and bullet-ridden homes, has come back to life.

It also led to a gender-equity review in college basketball and to changes in the women’s event, including branding the tournament with the moniker March Madness. The N.C.A.A. had previously resisted such a move.“Every budget line is compared and contrasted,” said Dan Gavitt, the N.C.A.A.’s senior vice president for basketball. “Where there are differences, they are resolved in the name of equity.”Prince accomplished last March what generations before her could not: She showed the disparity between the tournaments in a way that couldn’t be explained away.

Mounting Data Shows J&J Vaccine as Effective as Pfizer and Moderna,2022-03-15 21:47:12+00:00,"Roughly 17 million Americans received the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine, only to be told later that it was the least protective of the options available in the United States. But new data suggest that the vaccine is now preventing infections, hospitalizations and deaths at least as well as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.The reasons aren’t clear, and not all experts are convinced that the vaccine has vindicated itself. But the accumulating data nonetheless offer considerable reassurance to recipients of the vaccine and, if confirmed, have broad implications for its deployment in parts of the world.In Africa, for example, distribution of a single-dose vaccine that can be refrigerated for months is by far the most practical option.Johnson & Johnson has at least temporarily shut down the only plant making usable batches of the vaccine. But the South Africa-based Aspen Pharmacare is gearing up to supply large quantities to the rest of the continent. Only about 13 percent of Africans are fully vaccinated, and only about 1 percent have received a booster dose.  “In the setting of Africa, where we have the need to quickly get vaccines out, the single dose is very exciting,” said Linda Gail-Bekker, director of the Desmond Tutu H.I.V. Center at the University of Cape Town, who has studied the vaccine’s effectiveness in South Africa.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was billed as an attractive option for communities with limited access to health care, including some within the United States, because of its ease of delivery and mild side effects. But it has had a bumpy journey.The shot seemed to produce a weaker initial immune response, and more people who got the single-dose vaccine had breakthrough infections, compared with those who got two doses of Pfizer or Moderna, the mRNA vaccines.In April, federal health officials in the United States and in South Africa paused the J.&J. vaccine’s distribution as they examined reports of a rare blood-clotting disorder in women. Though both countries resumed the rollouts soon after, the vaccine’s reputation never fully recovered.But the notion that the vaccine is inferior has grown outdated, some experts said: More recent data suggest that it has more than held its own against its competitors.  “We’ve been aware that J.&J. has been kind of downgraded in people’s minds,” Dr. Gail-Bekker said. But “it punches above its weight for a single-dose vaccine.”Until last June, the cumulative data from the C.D.C. showed that immunization with the Moderna vaccine resulted in the lowest rates of breakthrough infections; those who got Johnson & Johnson saw the highest rates, with Pfizer-BioNTech somewhere in the middle.During the summer months, the gaps — particularly between J.&J. and Pfizer — began to narrow. By now, all the vaccines seem to be performing about equally well against coronavirus infections; in fact, Johnson & Johnson appears to be holding up slightly better.  As of Jan. 22, the latest data available, unvaccinated people were 3.2 times as likely to become infected as those who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine; they were 2.8 times as likely to become infected as those who received two doses of the Moderna vaccine and 2.4 times as likely as those with two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech. Overall, then, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine appeared to be somewhat more protective against infection than the two alternatives.Among Americans who got booster doses, all the vaccines appeared to have roughly the same effectiveness against infection. A booster shot did not add much to Johnson & Johnson’s previous level of protection (although the data do not indicate who received which type of booster shot).The data were collected by the C.D.C. from 29 jurisdictions, representing 67 percent of the population.  “The C.D.C. data adds to the growing body of evidence indicating the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine provides durable protection against breakthrough infection and hospitalization,” the company said in a statement.The findings indicate that the J.&J. vaccine deserves a closer look, said Dr. Larry Corey, an expert in vaccine development at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated March 29, 2022, 7:42 p.m. ETTwenty-one states file a lawsuit to block the mask mandate on public transportation.Pfizer and Moderna boosters help protect Americans who received J.&J. shots, the C.D.C. reports.The BA.2 subvariant of Omicron accounts for over half of new U.S. coronavirus cases, the C.D.C. estimates.“This vaccine platform may have some surprising characteristics that we hadn’t anticipated,” he said. The data “is interesting, provocative, and we should spend more time understanding it.”Dr. Corey said the results jibe with his experience in H.I.V. research with the adenovirus that forms the backbone of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. “It has much longer durability than almost any other platform that we’ve ever worked with,” he said.Scientists are only beginning to guess why the vaccine’s profile is improving with the passing months.Levels of antibodies skyrocket in the first few weeks after immunization, but then rapidly wane. The J.&J. vaccine may produce antibodies that decline more slowly than those produced by the other vaccines, some research suggests. Or those antibodies may become more sophisticated over time, through a biological phenomenon called affinity maturation.Perhaps, some researchers suggest, the vaccine offered a more robust defense against the Omicron variant, responsible for the huge increase in infections over the past few months. And studies have shown that the vaccine trains other parts of the immune system at least as well as the other two vaccines.  Not everyone is convinced that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is catching up. It may only appear to be effective now because many recipients got breakthrough infections early on, gaining additional immunity, said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University. “They may have a different immunity profile,” she said.The infection rate is now lower among people who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine but did not get a booster. Still, the death rate is slightly higher, compared with that among those who got the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, Dr. Dean noted.But the differences are not huge, and disappeared among those who got booster shots. The C.D.C.’s statistics on deaths only run through Jan. 1, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine’s edge may only become apparent in data from February or March, said Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who collaborated with Johnson & Johnson in the development of the vaccine.Deaths tend to lag infections, often by weeks or months, “because many deaths are after prolonged hospital courses,” he said.Dr. Dean said for a clearer comparison of the vaccines, she would like to see data with information on individual factors, like prior infections and other high-risk conditions, rather than the age-adjusted overall numbers provided by the C.D.C.“It is a shame that we don’t have more direct study of outcomes among people who received J.&J.,” she said. That is in part because fewer people got the vaccine than the mRNA vaccines, she said, but also “because we’re relying on other countries generating data.”  Some of that information has come from South Africa. In one trial, called Sisonke, Dr. Gail-Bekker and her colleagues evaluated one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in nearly 500,000 health care workers, and two doses in about 240,000 of those individuals.  In the first part of the trial, the researchers matched the recipients with a control group by age, sex, risk factors for Covid, socioeconomic status and prior Covid infection. When the Delta variant was dominant in the country, they found that the vaccine had an effectiveness of about 67 percent against hospitalization and about 82 percent against death. Protection against the Beta variant was similar.“Certainly during the Beta and the Delta waves, the single dose worked very well for severe disease and death,” Dr. Gail-Bekker said.When the Omicron variant began circulating in South Africa, the researchers offered a booster of the same vaccine to the participants. Fewer than half of them agreed.“It was extraordinary, the pushback,” Dr. Gail-Bekker said. By that point, the perception was that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were superior. “There was a feeling again that we were offering a very second-rate option,” she recalled.Still, the data so far suggest that two doses of the J.&J. vaccine had an effectiveness of about 75 percent against hospitalization with the Omicron variant, comparable to the protection from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The researchers presented the findings last month at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Denver.Although the trial looked only at people who got two doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, it suggests that the vaccine may make an excellent booster for people who initially got two doses of an mRNA vaccine, experts said.  But in December, the C.D.C. recommended the mRNA vaccines over Johnson & Johnson’s for all adults, citing a risk of rare side effects like blood clots and Guillain-Barré syndrome. The agency found four cases of blood clots per million people who got the vaccine; women ages 30 to 39 had the highest incidence, at about 11 per million.The mRNA vaccines, too, have been associated with uncommon side effects. They are thought to cause about 11 cases of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, for every 100,000 vaccinated males aged 16 to 29 years.More data on different combinations of vaccines may clarify which is the safest and most effective in the long term, Dr. Dean said. The arrival of new variants may also give some vaccines an edge over others, she said.“I do keep a very open mind about what could end up being the best vaccine regimen for the future,” she said. "
3 European Leaders Say They Are in Kyiv to Support Ukrain,2022-03-16 01:23:04+00:00,"KYIV, Ukraine — The leaders of three eastern members of the European Union traveled to Kyiv on Tuesday on a high-risk mission that was kept under wraps until after they had boarded a train to the embattled Ukrainian capital.Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, posted photos on Facebook of the men sitting round a table and poring over maps, and the Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, did the same on Twitter.   “It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made,” Mr. Morawiecki wrote. “It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance.”  Later in the day, Ukrainian media aired video footage of President Volodymyr Zelensky, in what has become his signature khaki green T-shirt and fleece, striding into a meeting room and sitting down with Mr. Morawiecki, Mr. Fiala and the prime minister of Slovenia.“Your visit to Kyiv at this difficult time for Ukraine is a strong sign of support — we appreciate it,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement released with the footage.The photos released by European leaders earlier sought to convey a daring show of support for Ukraine three weeks after Russian troops invaded the country, and as the mayor of Kyiv warned of growing danger for the capital and its inhabitants.The symbolism was powerful.The Czech and Polish people were subjugated by the former Soviet Union and lived through decades of communist rule. Now, alarm has been growing that President Vladimir V. Putin is seeking to turn back the clock more than 30 years and trying to reclaim the lost Soviet sphere of influence.The European leaders were reported to have traveled by train from the Polish border, a journey of at least seven hours. Ukrainian officials released few details about the trip.  Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, writing on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon, embraced the visitors. “The courage of true friends of Ukraine,” he said. “Discussing support of Ukraine and strengthening sanctions against Russian aggression.”There was no indication that Moscow had guaranteed safe passage for the prime ministers. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said that the governments of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia had not been in touch with the Kremlin about Tuesday’s trip.The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, visiting a burning apartment building hit in one of Tuesday’s strikes, applauded the visitors.“Keep supporting Ukraine,” he said, “because we are fighting now not for Ukraine. This war touched everyone in the world, especially the European Union, the European family.”Mr. Klitschko warned that his city — and the whole country — face great danger in coming days. Earlier, his office announced a two-day curfew for the capital.On Tuesday, firefighters in Kyiv battled a fierce blaze in a 16-story apartment block for most of the day after a missile gouged a big crater at its entrance. They rescued residents through apartment windows by ladder through the thick smoke and later went back for some of the pets had been left behind. By midafternoon they had carried out two bodies in black body bags.Some of the survivors sat on benches, reluctant to leave even as the authorities offered to take them to a refuge.  “There was a huge roar and all the windows shattered,” Yelena Derevyanko said. She and her husband, Vadym, lived on the 16th floor and were rescued by firefighters.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.One of their neighbors, Mykola Fedkiv, a retired geologist, stood waiting all day hoping to get back into his apartment to collect his personal documents. “I came out with nothing,” he said. “I left everything: My telephone, my medicines, everything.”The explosions had jolted him awake, and he fled his apartment on the 12th floor down the main stairs. A fire was already burning on the first floor and he climbed through the blasted entrance hall and into the bomb crater where people grabbed his arms and pulled him out.Clutching a plastic bag of groceries someone had given him, he waved off a question as to where he would stay the night.“God knows,” he said.that the three traveling prime ministers had arrived “on behalf of” the European Union Council. However, E.U. officials said the men had not received the European Union’s blessing for their trip. The visit by the three leaders created some unusual friction within the European Union, whose 27 member states have projected a united front against Moscow, taking extraordinary measures to punish it for the attack on Ukraine with record speed.Prime Minister Morawiecki of Poland brought up his intention to visit Kyiv at an E.U. meeting last week at Versailles, outside Paris. But the visit to Kyiv never got a formal blessing from the bloc.  Still, the visit to Kyiv, which some E.U. officials worried might lead to promises that could not be kept, was welcomed as brave in parts of the bloc.“This is Europe at its best,” declared a headline in the popular German tabloid Bild, on an article that said: “Putin’s war is not over as long as Europe is ready to defend its values. With all the means it takes to do so. Even if it’s just a train ride in the shadow of bombs and missiles.”Carlotta Gallreported from Kyiv, and Matina Stevis-Gridnefffrom Brussels. Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Istanbul. "
Russian War Protester Who Burst Onto State TV Is Fined,2022-03-15 23:44:53+00:00,"A Russian state television employee who stormed a live broadcast on Monday was interrogated by the police for 14 hours and fined by a Moscow court on Tuesday.“I spent two days without sleep,” the woman, Marina Ovsyannikova, said in a video recorded outside of the courtroom on Tuesday by Mediazona, an online news site.“I wasn’t allowed to contact my relatives or people close to me,” Ms. Ovsyannikova said, adding that she was not allowed “access to any legal representation, so I was in a fairly difficult position.”Ms. Ovsyannikova, who worked for Channel 1 in Moscow, was detained on Monday after she burst onscreen during a popular news show, yelling, “Stop the war!” and holding up a sign that read, “They’re lying to you here.”  Immediately after, a Russian human rights group named OVD-Info circulated a prerecorded video in which Ms. Ovsyannikova said she was “deeply ashamed” to have helped make “Kremlin propaganda.”The fine issued Tuesday was for that video, not the on-air protest. Ms. Ovsyannikova was charged with organizing an unauthorized public event and fined the equivalent of about $273, according to Sergey Badamshin, the chairman of a Moscow bar association.The protest may cost her more dearly.Tass, a state publication, reported that Ms. Ovsyannikova was being investigated for violating Russia’s new “false information” law, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison for anyone convicted of disseminating news about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that goes against the Kremlin’s official narrative. Mr. Badamshin confirmed that the investigation was underway.Dmitri Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, said at a news conference Tuesday that what “this woman did is hooliganism.”Ms. Ovsyannikova got a much warmer response from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. In a televised address Tuesday, he expressed gratitude for “that woman who walked in the studio of Channel One with a poster against the war.” "
"Ukraine War Shifts the Agenda in Congress, Empowering the Cent",2022-03-15 21:48:13+00:00,"WASHINGTON — The escalating crisis in Ukraine is upending policy and political thinking on both the left and the right on Capitol Hill, as an immediate threat to the global order and soaring energy prices empower the political center at the expense of the two parties’ flanks.When lawmakers convene on Wednesday for a virtual speech by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Republicans and Democrats will be confronting a changed environment, for better and for worse.“It’s bringing Congress together in a way, frankly, I haven’t seen in my 12 years,” Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a confidant of President Biden, said on Tuesday of the consensus to support Ukraine. “You’d have to go back to 9/11 to see such a unified commitment.”That has meant a retreat by both parties from the policy proposals and political messages that most thrill their core supporters. On the left, Democrats are acquiescing to higher military spending and dropping a bid to pull back rapidly from fossil fuels. On the right, Trump-era isolationism and attacks on the trans-Atlantic alliance are being relegated to the fringe in Congress. Plans to make the president’s son Hunter Biden and Ukrainian corruption front and center in a Republican-controlled House now seem far-fetched.  “It’s grounding,” said Representative Peter Meijer, Republican of Michigan, who was once an intelligence analyst in Afghanistan and now faces a challenger on his right endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump. “You can propose something that outstrips the bounds of reality, that’s fine. Then you look at what’s happening in Ukraine, and it’s like a car accident, a near-death experience that snaps you back to reality.”Mr. Zelensky is expected on Wednesday to reiterate his request for a complicated swap that would send MIG fighter jets to Ukraine from Poland, and U.S.-made F-16 fighters to Poland. That could prompt accusations from some Republicans that the Biden administration, which has opposed the swap as a dangerous escalation of the conflict with no real military purpose, is soft on Russia.He is also likely to ask the United States to help close the airspace over his country to Russian aircraft, as he did on Tuesday when he addressed Canada’s Parliament.Republicans and Democrats alike have questioned the MIG deal now that the Defense Department has raised specific concerns about whether Ukraine could even fly the planes.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Mr. Zelensky would not get congressional support for a so-called no-fly zone over Ukraine, and he signaled ambivalence on the fighter jet transfer.  “Exactly how to make that happen is still under discussion,” he said.It is unclear whether the moment amounts to a hiatus in the partisan wars over national security. Republican leaders continue to strafe the president, accusing him of being weak toward Russia, coddling “petro-dictators” and betraying America’s energy security.“President Biden continues to have this attitude of, ‘Well, I don’t want to help Ukraine too much’ because he might offend Putin,” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, said this week on Fox Business, referring to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.Democrats are incredulous that Republicans — a vast majority of whom did not criticize Mr. Trump for repeatedly standing by Mr. Putin, undermining NATO and then withholding military aid from Mr. Zelensky to pressure him to dig up political dirt on Mr. Biden — have the gall to question the current president’s willingness to confront Russia.“If you are a reporter, and there is a battle for the free world led by Zelensky and Biden, you don’t have to pretend not to remember that Republicans exonerated Trump for extorting Zelensky,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii.But beyond partisan potshots, there are signs of the war’s very real impact. In December, when the House passed defense policy legislation authorizing $768 billion in military spending, 51 Democrats voted no, mainly because they saw that as far too much money. Last week, when the House funded the military and provided even more money — $782 billion and billions more for Ukraine — the number of Democrats voting in opposition dropped to 15.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated March 30, 2022, 5:42 a.m. ETStrikes continue in the Chernihiv region, despite Russia’s promises.Putin’s war complicates India’s middle path among the global powers.Here are the latest developments in Ukraine.“Defense budgets should be driven by our needs, not some artificial target, but it’s pretty clear we are living in a dangerous time,” said Representative Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, a Democrat in a difficult re-election fight.Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, conceded that the current crisis had sapped momentum, at least for now, from efforts to slash military spending.  “I do think Ukraine has just made it harder,” she said. “We had thought with the ending of the war in Afghanistan, we could push for a real reduction in the defense budget, and there will be another opportunity. But look, this is an epic battle.”Republicans are getting their own reality check. Under Mr. Trump, a growing faction of the party was pushing isolationism, questioning alliances and trade pacts, and pressing an “America First” agenda that would have fit well in the national mood leading up to World War II, Mr. Meijer said.In recent days, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a traditionalist Republican, sat down with the German ambassador to the United States to thank her for her country’s commitment to NATO’s defense and its aid to Ukraine.In an interview, Mr. Cole even suggested reviving the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a landmark trade pact negotiated by President Barack Obama that would have tied together economies in Asia, Australia, New Zealand, North America and South America to isolate China. In one of his first acts as president, Mr. Trump scuttled the agreement.“Ukraine has got a lot of Republicans rethinking the importance of international alliances,” Mr. Cole said. “Other countries are not always a burden. They’re quite often an asset.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral.

Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.Fealty to Mr. Trump’s foreign policy suddenly seems like a potential liability. Former Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, who is running for the Senate seat held by Richard M. Burr, a Republican who is retiring, hit his Trump-endorsed primary opponent, Representative Ted Budd, as pro-Putin in a new advertisement this week.“Budd’s votes have been friendly toward Russia,” Mr. McCrory says in the ad. “He voted against sanctions on Russia. These are serious times, and we need serious senators.”  For Democrats, the shift in priorities has had a price. Taking his cues from his party’s environmental wing, Mr. Biden had hoped to move the United States away from fossil fuels, blocking new leases for oil and gas exploration on federal land, opening up large swaths of ocean and land to wind and solar development, and pushing an ambitious timetable to move the country to electric cars and trucks.Now, the fossil fuel industry is ascendant. More mainstream Democrats are using the language of Republicans, talking about an “all of the above” energy strategy that includes renewable fuels and oil and gas. Natural gas is again spoken of as a “bridge” fuel to clean energy, not an enemy of the planet.“Some of my colleagues are presenting a false choice,” said Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, a leading voice of centrist Democrats. “You can be for alternative energy and energy independence with aggressive long-term goals, and be for fully tapping our domestic energy resources.”In private gatherings of House Democrats, Mr. Malinowski said, a few lawmakers still speak up against the extraction of any fossil fuels, “but they’re not really a powerful voice in our meetings.”Republicans have other course corrections to contend with. Conservatives like Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, have signaled that they want to revive investigations of Hunter Biden and the lucrative seat he once held on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company. With such investigations would come accusations of rampant corruption in Ukraine and unsubstantiated accusations that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered with U.S. elections in 2016.But Ukraine is not the political target it once was. In a September 2019 poll by YouGov, 36 percent of registered voters in the United States were not sure whether Ukraine was friendly or unfriendly. Only 41 percent called the nation friendly or an ally. In a new YouGov survey, 81 percent of American voters said Ukraine was either friendly or an ally, a number that rivals or surpasses those for longtime U.S. partners like France and Japan.Ms. Jayapal warned that dredging up Burisma would allow Democrats to remind the nation that every Republican except Senator Mitt Romney of Utah voted to allow Mr. Trump to go unpunished for humiliating and strong-arming Mr. Zelensky for his personal political benefit. And Mr. Cole counseled against such an approach.  “People might be a little less likely to bring that up,” he said of Burisma, especially when Ukrainians are “the point of the spear against Russian aggression.”“These are people who have bought into defending their country with their lives, at great risk and sacrifice,” Mr. Cole said. “I don’t think there will be a lot of investigations that put Ukraine into a negative light.” "
How Shackleton’s Endurance Was Found,2022-03-16 02:39:04+00:00,"When perhaps the most celebrated shipwreck in Mensun Bound’s long career as a marine archaeologist was discovered, he was off viewing some penguins a mile away.It was the afternoon of March 5. Mr. Bound was traveling aboard an icebreaker in the Weddell Sea in Antarctica with the Endurance22 expedition, which was hunting for the century-old remains of Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance.Technicians had been running an undersea drone day and night for two weeks, scanning the seafloor with sonar looking for the 144-foot wooden ship, which was crushed in the Weddell’s treacherous pack ice and sank in 1915 during Shackleton’s ill-fated attempt to be the first to cross Antarctica.So far there had been no sign of Endurance below the ice-covered waters, and there were only four days left before the icebreaker would have to return to port in Cape Town. Mr. Bound, the exploration director who had previously described Endurance as “the most unreachable wreck ever” because of its location in one of the most remote and iciest seas in the world, and John Shears, the expedition leader, needed a break.  “We’d been talking how we need to get off the ship to stretch our legs,” Mr. Bound said in an interview later with Reach the World, a nonprofit educational group that produced streaming videos from the ship for classrooms. “And we decided today was the day.”At 4 p.m. they trekked to an iceberg embedded in the pack ice about a mile away. The views were stunning and there were even a few Adélie penguins nearby to keep them company.When they arrived back at the ship they were summoned to the bridge, where they encountered Nicolas Vincent, who managed the underwater elements of the expedition. He was holding up his phone so they could see a photograph on it, Mr. Bound recalled in the interview. “And he said ‘Gents, I want to introduce you to the Endurance.’”“It was the first beautiful picture of it,” Mr. Bound said. “I mean, it was incredible.”  While he and Mr. Shears had been off the ship, the drone had sent back some intriguing sonar images. Unlike some previous false alarms, on closer inspection it was obvious that these were of a ship, lying more or less upright on the seafloor. It could only be Endurance.  The image Mr. Vincent had on his phone was the first of the ship since the famous photographs taken by Shackleton’s photographer, Frank Hurley, while Endurance was being ravaged by the ice.The Hunt for the Wreck of the EnduranceBattling sea ice and freezing temperatures, a team of explorers and researchers found Ernest Shackleton’s ship that sank in the Antarctic in 1915.Historic Moment: The discovery was announced on March 9. The wreck was located at the bottom of the Weddell Sea using undersea drones.The Expedition: Endurance22 began its search in February. Researchers studying Antarctic ice and global warming were part of the team.Lush Garden: Following the discovery, marine biologists have been scanning footage of the wreck. It could help determine which species live on it, and if any are new.From the Archives: Read the cablegram reporting the loss of the ship that Shackleton sent out after making it to safety in the Falkland Islands.Four days later the discovery was announced to the world, accompanied by the release of a few photographs and a short video. Endurance, whose sinking led to one of the greatest tales of leadership and survival in exploration history, with Shackleton and his 27 men all reaching safety, was in relatively pristine condition, its name still emblazoned on the stern, glass still intact in the portholes, caulking still visible between the planks of the hull.Mr. Bound, whose archaeological credits include excavating a 2,600-year-old Etruscan ship in Italy, described the remains of Endurance as “the finest wooden shipwreck I have ever seen — by far.”The expedition, financed by more than $10 million from an anonymous donor, had left South Africa aboard the icebreaker Agulhas II in early February. It arrived on Feb. 16 at the search site, a 150-square mile zone that had been chosen based on Endurance’s last known position, which had been determined by Shackleton’s captain and navigator, Frank Worsley.A previous expedition three years before had ended in failure when technicians lost contact with the undersea drone and it was not recovered.This time the expedition had two newer drones, a primary and a backup, that were flat torpedo-like pieces of equipment about 13 feet long and 5 feet wide with thrusters that enabled them to move in all directions.  Like those on the previous expedition, these drones could operate independently, programmed in advance with coordinates and a search pattern. But unlike the earlier equipment, these were tethered to the ship by a thin, miles-long fiber optic cable that could be unspooled as the drone traveled to the seafloor. The cable transmitted images to the ship in real time, but could also be used to send new instructions to the drone to alter its course if necessary.  Chad Bonin, who supervised the operation of the drones, said in the same interview that by March 5, the primary drone — named Ellie, for Elephant Island, where Shackleton and his crew first sailed to safety after Endurance sank — had done about 30 dives.There had been a few early glitches, Mr. Bonin said. The fiber optic cable broke during one dive and had to be respliced. The cold water and high pressure 10,000 feet down caused problems with one of the thrusters. There were also issues with the winch used to lift the drone, which weighed more than 3,000 pounds, into the water.“Once we ironed out the kinks and everything else it was great after that,” Mr. Bonin told Reach the World. “From that point it was just dive after dive,” he added. Each dive lasted between four and eight hours, with several hours between to recharge the drone’s batteries.The drone carried radar equipment on either side, which scanned a mile-wide swath of the seafloor while traveling about 225 feet above it. Mr. Bonin and others monitored the images, staring at computer screens in a cramped operations center in the ship’s hold.“The seabed on the Weddell Sea is pretty much flat,” he said. “So anything out of the ordinary would pop up like a red flag.”  Over two weeks, the team saw some interesting things, but after closer inspection all of the images turned out to be natural features or were otherwise ruled out as not being Endurance.Even as the deadline for leaving the search site approached, though, Mr. Bonin remained optimistic.“Every day I would walk on deck and say, ‘Today’s the day,’” he recalled.  When he first saw the image on March 5, he was excited but cautious. “My first reaction was — Hah! We found it. But we have to verify.” It didn’t take long to be persuaded.The drone returned to the ship and technicians swapped out the sonar equipment for a high-resolution camera and a laser-surveying device to make highly detailed scans of the site.Mr. Bound had expected the wreck to be well preserved, given the cold water and the lack of parasitic worms that consume wood and have wreaked havoc on shipwrecks elsewhere.  Combined with the clarity of the water, the drone’s camera revealed remarkable details. A crewman’s boot was seen in one spot. Elsewhere the images clearly showed where some of the ship’s timbers had been sawed off for use on the ice. The camera was even able to peer through portholes into some of the cabins.The images and scans will be used for educational materials and exhibits.“We came, we saw, we measured in detail,” Mr. Bound said. Then they left without touching anything because the wreck is protected under the 60-year-old Antarctic Treaty.Before leaving the Weddell Sea, the expedition team and the ship’s crew celebrated with a party on the ice, setting up a large tent with food, drink and music.The icebreaker is now sailing toward Cape Town and is expected there in about a week.  On Friday the ship stopped at Grytviken, a former whaling station on the island of South Georgia. Shackleton and five of his crew had reached the island in May 1916 after a 16-day, 800-mile journey across the Southern Ocean in an open lifeboat.After arranging the rescue of the remaining crew from Elephant Island, Shackleton had returned to Britain to a hero’s welcome. He then organized another Antarctic expedition and returned to South Georgia in 1921 where he died of a heart attack at age 47.He is buried there, and members of the expedition team visited his grave, leaving new images of his ship against the granite headstone.  Stefanie Arndt, a scientist from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany who was on board the ship studying how the Weddell Sea ice may be changing as the world warms, described the visit on Twitter.“We ended this historic expedition yesterday with a visit to South Georgia,” Dr. Arndt wrote. “Here we visited Sir Ernest Shackleton’s grave — and brought his ship back to him by pictures.“An emotional end to a long story.” "
Biden Will Travel to Europe Next Week for NATO Meeting,2022-03-15 19:32:57.974000+00:00,"President Biden will travel to an extraordinary NATO summit meeting in Brussels on March 24 and will also attend the European Union’s summit meeting the same day, White House and European officials said on Tuesday.The high-stakes gathering is to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir V. Putin has intensified the bombardment of civilian targets as his unprovoked invasion of the country entered its third week.“His goal is to meet face to face with his European counterparts and talk about where we are at this point in the conflict, in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,’’ the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said at a briefing on Tuesday afternoon. “We’ve been incredibly aligned to date. That doesn’t happen by accident.”The trip comes as Mr. Biden, who helped to coordinate a rapid Western response to the invasion centered on powerful sanctions and increased military aid, faces intense pressure to take more direct action to stop the killing of Ukrainian civilians. Cease-fire talks between the combatants have so far yielded no results.  Ms. Psaki provided few details of Mr. Biden’s trip and declined to say if he planned to meet with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he has praised as a hero. She also would not say whether Mr. Biden or other U.S. officials would meet with refugees who have fled the fighting.“We’re still finalizing the trip at this time,” said Ms. Psaki, adding, “Nothing on the table at this point in time, but the real focus right now is to meet with NATO partners in Brussels.”Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris visited Poland and Romania, NATO allies along Ukraine’s western borders, to express support for Ukraine and suggest that Moscow might need to be held accountable for possible war crimes in the conflict. Mr. Zelensky is expected to request greater economic and military aid when he delivers a virtual address to Congress on Wednesday.Mr. Biden will join 30 NATO leaders at the special, hastily organized meeting, then will go to a previously scheduled European Council summit. Twenty-one of the European Union’s 27 members belong to NATO, and it is possible that close NATO allies like Sweden and Finland will also attend the meeting.Administration officials said that the White House was exploring whether Mr. Biden might continue his trip to Eastern Europe, to meet some of the refugees flowing out of the country.  Mr. Biden also plans to announce more support for Ukraine’s defense, Ms. Psaki said.“We are on Day 19,” Ms. Psaki noted of the Russian invasion. “In addition to their incredible courage and bravery,’’ she said of the Ukrainians, “one of the reasons that they are able to hold back and push back against the Russian military is because of the significant amount of military assistance we have provided.”Mr. Biden, officials say, wants to use the trip to make the case that he is succeeding at unifying NATO and other European allies. But European diplomats are concerned that there are no major decisions on the table and they are working to come up with an announcement that could arise from the extraordinary meeting of the Western alliance.“Mr. Biden’s goal is to meet face to face with his European counterparts and talk about where we are at this point in the conflict, in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,” Ms. Psaki said.Ms. Psaki shrugged off Russia’s announcement on Tuesday that it would impose reciprocal sanctions on top U.S. officials, including herself and President Biden. She suggested, jokingly, that the Kremlin’s announcement might have missed its intended mark. The president, Ms. Psaki said, is a “junior, so they might have sanctioned his dad by mistake.” "
Russian Artists Lose the Tools of Their Trades as Companies Pull Out,2022-03-16 15:40:05+00:00,"In a call from his car on Sunday, a photographer from Moscow explained why he was driving to Tbilisi, Georgia, having left his apartment and essentially his whole life behind.For one, he has no work. No one he knows is shooting fashion look books or organizing the parties he usually photographs. The Western publications he worked for have all withdrawn from Russia, wary of a new law that makes the spread of “false information” about the war in Ukraine punishable by up to 15 years in jail.It was this law and the harsh crackdowns on antiwar protesters in recent weeks that made him realize he had to leave, he said.  “There was always a line that we all could feel — what you definitely cannot do and what you can do,” said Alexander, 39, who did not want to give his last name because of safety concerns. “That line is gone. Anything can happen.”  Since Russia invaded Ukraine, shocking much of the world, Russians working in creative spheres have found themselves squeezed from within and without. The Kremlin’s intensifying crackdown on free speech has prompted some to flee the country to avoid being silenced or arrested. And the decision of Western companies to stop doing business in Russia — including website hosting services, software makers and financial services firms — has deprived many of the modern tools of their trades.With Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Wise and other financial services companies withdrawing from the Russian market, Russians have been unable to pay for any subscriptions outside of Russia — for example, for website hosting, Spotify, Netflix, newspapers and magazines — or to receive money through sites like Patreon or from employers in Europe or the United States.Adobe, which makes software that creative workers around the world rely on, has stopped sales in Russia, as have Canon, Nikon and Microsoft, among others. And Sony, Warner Music and Universal, the three biggest music conglomerates, announced last week that they were suspending operations in Russia.Workers in the creative sphere felt the impact of the withdrawals within days. On Monday morning, Moish Soloway, 44, who owns a record label for Russian artists that works with a Sony-owned distributor, attempted to upload one of his artists’ new albums to a platform that would allow the songs to be played on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music and beyond.  The system’s response: “NOT cleared for sale.”  AloeVera, a band that recently joined Mr. Soloway’s label, has been quietly banned from playing in many venues, festivals and concerts in Russia for more than a year. Vera Musaelian, 34, the lead singer, said that after she and another bandmate protested and she married an opposition politician, AloeVera joined a list of forbidden music acts that Russian security services have circulated to concert and event organizers.To maintain a small income and a connection with fans, the band has relied on Patreon, a platform where members can subscribe to receive content from musicians, podcasters and others. Last week, Patreon sent an email to its creators in Russia saying that they needed to withdraw any funds stored with the platform immediately, because the suspension of PayPal, Visa and Mastercard services in Russia would prevent them from accessing their money in the future.Patreon “was a way for our listeners to say they’re still with us,” Musaelian said. “Now they can’t pay for their subscriptions.” Visa and Mastercard cards issued in Russia no longer work for payments outside of the country.Ellen Satterwhite, Patreon’s head of U.S. policy, said in a statement that the company was “doing everything we can to support creators in Ukraine and Russia within the law and international financial limitations..”  Mr. Soloway compared the developments in recent days to the artistic isolation of the Soviet Union. “The Soviet government was terrified of rock ’n’ roll,” Mr. Soloway said.Rock and jazz and other music genres from the West were banned during the Soviet era, though an underground scene flourished. Today, it is American companies that are preventing new music from being played in Russia, including songs that could take a stand against the war in Ukraine, Mr. Soloway said.  Of course, with laws that forbid even calling the war a war, and blocks on social media platforms like Facebook and on independent media outlets, the government is stifling creative expression at its root.How the Ukraine War Is Affecting the Cultural WorldCard 1 of 8Olga Smirnova.

The French actor, who became a Russian citizen in 2013 and is one of the closest Western celebrities to Mr. Putin, took a surprising stance when he denounced the war during an interview.For visual artists, Russia’s shutdown of Instagram on Sunday meant the loss of a global platform where they shared their portfolios, sold prints and met people who would commission their work.“My Instagram is my business card, it’s where I build my brand, where I communicate with my audience,” said Anastasia Venkova, 30, a conceptual and performance artist who fled Moscow recently out of safety concerns. “I have a website but no one goes there. Gallerists don’t want your website anyway, they want your Instagram.”  Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, said on Twitter that the government’s “decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world,” and that 80 percent of Instagram users in Russia follow an account from another country. “This is wrong,” he said.Ms. Venkova said many of her followers will hopefully stick around by using a VPN, but she is worried that if the Russian government labels Meta, which owns Instagram, as an “extremist organization” — a process that has already been put in motion — even so much as having an Instagram account could put her in danger.  Anya, 39, a Moscow photographer who said she did not want to give her last name out of concern for safety, said she used to work with international brands like Estée Lauder, but she does not have any clients now, since they all pulled their business out of the country.Canon, where she purchases her supplies, has stopped product deliveries into Russia. Photoshop, which she relies on for editing, is owned by Adobe, which also suspended sales and services in Russia. The company that hosts Anya’s website sent her an email saying it would no longer provide services to users registered in Russia because of the actions of “your authoritarian government.”Anya said that sanctions like these would not affect the elite, who have bank accounts and lots of money abroad or hidden away. “This is hitting exactly the people who go out to protest,” she said. “The people who live in big cities, who travel, who have friends around the world, who have international jobs and don’t support the government. They’re now forced to leave the country, or to stop working.”  She added that her problems were very small compared to the violence in Ukraine. “I would give up anything for this war to stop,” she said. But, she said, “the problem with some of these sanctions is that the country will close even more. It’ll play into Putin’s propaganda. ‘Look at how the West treats us, they hit us with these sanctions.’ This strengthens him.” "
Officials in Mariupol Struggle to Account for the Dead,2022-03-15 20:54:01+00:00,"LVIV, Ukraine — With some residents crushed in the rubble from a relentless two-week onslaught by Russian forces, and others dying in freezing conditions with no heat, food or clean water, officials in the besieged coastal city of Mariupol are struggling to account for the number of dead and missing. Officially, 2,400 civilians killed in the city have been identified, but Pyotr Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city government, said he believed the toll was far higher. “We have inaccurate data on civilians killed,” he said in an interview with Current Time, a Ukrainian radio station. He said the official figure represented a “small handful” of those killed and estimated that the actual total could be as high as 20,000. In a telephone interview with The New York Times later, Mr. Andryushchenko said that 2,000 vehicles had managed to escape the city on Tuesday and that another 2,000 were packed and ready to leave. Officials told civilians hoping to leave to “delete all messengers and photos from phones” in case Russian soldiers tried to search them for signs of support for Ukrainian forces.   A battleground since the first hours of the war, Mariupol is under an increasingly relentless assault that is taking an unspeakable toll. Ukrainian estimates for the number of civilians trapped in the city have ranged from 200,000 to 400,000, with the latest estimate being 300,000. The region’s top official, Pavlo Kyrylenko, who until martial law was declared was its governor, announced that the Russians were also holding doctors and patients of the main intensive care hospital hostage. An estimated 400 people are inside. “It is impossible to get out of the hospital,” Mr. Kyrylenko wrote on Telegram, quoting a message from one of the facility’s employees. “They shoot hard, we sit in the basement. Cars have not been able to drive to the hospital for two days. High-rise buildings are burning around.”Battered by Russian shelling, the city has been overwhelmed by the wounded and dead. Videos shared on Telegram showed residents of the Cheryomushki neighborhood burying a body in a courtyard. Another video showed how local people had turned a post office building into a makeshift morgue, with “MORGUE” spray-painted in large Cyrillic letters on the outside of the ground floor of the building. “Here, in this building of the New Post Office on Cheryomushki, they stack corpses, which in the future they themselves will bury,” a man can be heard saying in the video, which he posted to the Telegram channel Mariupol Now.  Russian forces have dropped more than 100 bombs within the city limits, according to a Telegram post by the Mariupol city council, destroying nearly all basic services, even as they battle Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of the metropolis. The Kremlin has said that it is Ukrainian forces that are keeping people trapped in the city. The Ukrainian government says that repeated attempts at mass evacuation have failed as they came under attack by Russian forces. Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3Ongoing peace talks. During peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Russia promised it would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, and Ukraine said it was ready to declare itself permanently neutral. Even so, weeks of further negotiation may be needed to reach an agreement, and Russia appears determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine.On the ground. Russia’s apparent concessions in the north of Ukraine reflected a successful Ukrainian resistance that has bogged down Russia’s forces around Kyiv’s suburbs and retaken territory near the capital and cities closer to the Russian border.New sanctions. The United States is preparing new sanctions targeting the supply chains of Russia’s military industrial sector as it seeks to erode Moscow’s ability to attack Ukraine. The new measures will be rolled out in coordination with Western allies.There is no completely safe route in or out of the city. The roads are studded with land mines, according to international observers, and the fighting rarely subsides. The Ukrainian Army’s high command said on Tuesday that its forces had managed to repel the latest Russian attempt to move into the city, claiming to have destroyed two tanks, seven infantry fighting vehicles and one armored personnel carrier. “After the losses, the occupiers stopped the offensive and retreated,” the Ukrainian military said. The Ukrainians noted that their forces had also suffered losses. It is impossible to independently verify almost any information out of Mariupol, as nearly all lines of communication have been severed. Mr. Andryushchenko, the adviser to the city government, declined to comment in his phone interview with The Times on whether he and the mayor would be evacuating from the city. The mayor’s security would likely be of concern: Russian forces kidnapped the mayor of nearby Melitopol and installed a replacement. “We sincerely hope for the safety of our mayor and that our defenders will help ensure it,” Mr. Andryushchenko said. “We know for sure that he will not accept the Russian occupation under any circumstances, will not cooperate with the occupiers and will not recognize any occupation authority.”But he was also at a loss for words thinking about the city’s future. He has estimated that 80 percent of the residential housing stock has been destroyed. “What kind of city can it be?” "
Ukraine’s National Anthem Reverberates Around the World,2022-03-15 16:51:45+00:00,"Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the soaring melody of Ukraine’s national anthem has been heard worldwide, from antiwar protests in Moscow to the stages of major concert halls, from N.B.A. basketball arenas to TikTok posts.Known by its opening line, “Ukraine’s glory has not perished,” the anthem is being heard daily in Ukraine too, played by military bands in the middle of bomb-damaged cities, sung tearfully by women sweeping up debris in their homes and, on Saturday, in a vital open-air performance by an opera company in the port city of Odessa, despite fears of an imminent Russian bombing campaign.  And on Monday night, the anthem shook the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, whose white travertine exterior was draped in an enormous Ukrainian flag and bathed in blue and yellow lights for its “Concert for Ukraine.”  Alyona Alyona, one of Ukraine’s biggest rappers, said in a Skype interview from her home in Baryshivka, a town east of Kyiv, that she was hearing the anthem about “20 times a day” on Ukrainian TV, where it was being used to rally the country. She had contributed to a compilation of the country’s music stars singing it, she added. “This song has a very big meaning,” she said.Even in Russia, Ukraine’s anthem has been heard, with some antiwar protesters in Moscow having been filmed defiantly singing it while being arrested.Paul Kubicek, a political scientist at Oakland University who has written extensively about Ukraine, said the anthem was penned in the 1860s when much of what is today Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire. It was “a time of cultural awakening,” Kubicek said, with elites looking to “revive and celebrate a Ukrainian heritage that was at risk of being lost to a process of Russification.”Those elites included Pavlo Chubynsky, an ethnologist and poet, who in 1862 wrote the lyrics after being inspired by patriotic songs from Serbia and Poland. The following year, a composer and priest, Mykhailo Verbytsky, set Chubynsky’s words to music.Rory Finnin, a professor of Ukrainian studies at Cambridge University, said Chubynsky’s song was one of a host of texts that worried the Russian authorities around that time. In 1863, they began censoring almost all Ukrainian publications, Finnin said. Soon, Chubynsky was expelled from the country “for disturbing the minds” of the public, Finnin added.  The Russian Empire’s efforts to quash Ukrainian identity didn’t meet with much success. After World War I, Chubynsky’s song was briefly made Ukraine’s anthem (in 1918, The New York Times published its lyrics) until the country was absorbed into the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities later gave Ukraine a new anthem, claiming the country had “found happiness in the Soviet Union.”It was only after the Soviet Union collapsed that Chubynsky and Verbytsky’s work returned as the national anthem., and it has been a vital part of Ukrainian life ever since. In 2013 and 2014, it was sung hourly in Kyiv’s Maidan Square at protests against President Viktor F. Yanukovych’s push to make the country closer to Russia. Finnin said he was present at some of those protests and the anthem “was almost used for counting time.”Now, the anthem’s being used to inspire once more, both within the country and abroad. Below are some of the more notable international performances from the past two weeks:Emanuel Ax, Leonidas Kavakos and Yo-Yo Ma  To open a recent performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington, the Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos said he wanted to play Ukraine’s anthem as a sign of “respect and solidarity” with the country. What starts as a gentle, almost brittle, rendition, soon brings out the melody’s power.How the Ukraine War Is Affecting the Cultural WorldCard 1 of 8Olga Smirnova.

The entire audience quickly got to its feet. On Monday, Buialskyi sang the anthem again at the Met’s gala in support of Ukraine.  The Orchestre de Paris, conducted by Marin Alsop  Marin Alsop appeared intense as she conducted the Orchestra de Paris in the anthem earlier this month, and with players standing to perform, she gave the anthem verve and power.In Concert Halls Across Europe  As well as the above standout performances, the anthem has filled concert halls in the Netherlands, Britain, Poland, France, Germany and other nations across Europe, as this video compilation shows.
