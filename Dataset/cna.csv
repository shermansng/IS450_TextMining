Saudi women drive for extra cash as costs climb,2022-03-13 12:31:06+08:00,"RIYADH: Like other Saudi women, Fahda Fahd couldn't legally drive until 2018, but her lime-green Kia is now a route to extra cash as living costs rise in the conservative kingdom.  When she's not working full time at a healthcare call centre, the 54-year-old picks up fares in the capital Riyadh from a ride-hailing app exclusively for women.  Fahd said her family was supportive of her second job, on two conditions: No long trips or men as passengers.  ""I decided to work as a taxi driver to earn extra income,"" said Fahd, wearing a black head covering and an anti-coronavirus face mask.  ""My salary is not enough for my three children, and especially for my daughter who has special needs,"" she told AFP.  Sweeping social reforms, including lifting the infamous ban on women driving, have transformed life for many Saudis, but rising costs are increasingly problematic.  Fahd says her salary of 4,000 Saudi riyals (US$1,066) a month from her regular job is not enough - but driving brings in another 2,500 riyals.  She usually hits the road before her shift starts at 2pm, sometimes accepting passengers on her way home at 10pm, and says she appreciates the flexible hours.  ""It has allowed me to help my retired husband pay monthly bills and for my children's school needs,"" she said, checking her phone for the latest fare.  Costs are creeping up in Saudi Arabia, which is on a drive to reduce its economic reliance on oil and in July 2020 hiked value added tax to 15 per cent.  Last December, transport costs were up 7.2 per cent year-on-year, part of a 1.2 per cent rise in consumer prices.  At the same time, millions of Saudi women are finding jobs as female employment gains acceptance in the deeply patriarchal society.  Women made up more than a third of the workforce last year for the first time, government figures showed.  They are among the Saudis now commonly seen serving customers in restaurants, cafes and shoe stores, filling jobs formerly done by foreigners as the government pursues its ""Saudisation"" plan for the economy.  Traditionally, Saudi women were forbidden from mixing with men outside their extended family.  Insaf, a 30-year-old mother of three, said she turned to driving after her husband died suddenly.  ""He didn't leave us a fortune, so I had to work to support my children,"" she told AFP, preferring to use a pseudonym for privacy reasons.  ""I am using my late husband's car to drive women and children in the neighbourhood to schools or shopping centres.  ""My work as a driver has given me a new chance at life.""  Since 2018, more than 200,000 women have obtained driving licences, with car sales rising five percent last year, according to media reports.  Egyptian passenger Aya Diab, 29, said she was ""more comfortable dealing with women"", and a Saudi customer who spoke on condition of anonymity expressed a similar sentiment.  ""I feel like I'm with my sister,"" she said, sitting in the front seat next to Fahd as they drove off. "
"China records nearly 3,400 daily COVID-19 cases in worst outbreak in two years",2022-03-13 20:16:19+08:00,"BEIJING: Chinese health authorities reported nearly 3,400 COVID-19 cases on Sunday (Mar 13), double the previous day, forcing lockdowns on virus hotspots as the country contends with its gravest outbreak in two years.  A nationwide surge in cases has seen authorities close schools in Shanghai and lock down several northeastern cities, as almost 19 provinces battle clusters of the Omicron and Delta variants.  The southern Chinese tech hub Shenzhen was put under a citywide lockdown Sunday, the local government announced, after it reported 66 new coronavirus cases and sealed off the central business district.  Home to tech giants including Huawei and Tencent, the city of around 17 million across the border from COVID-hit Hong Kong has told residents to stay home to tamp down an Omicron flare-up, having already closed non-essential venues and banned restaurant dining in recent days.  The city of Jilin has been partially locked down, with hundreds of neighbourhoods sealed up, an official announced Sunday, while Yanji, an urban area of nearly 700,000 bordering North Korea, was fully closed off.  China, where the virus was first detected in late 2019, has maintained a strict ""zero-Covid'' policy enforced by swift lockdowns, travel restrictions and mass testing when clusters have emerged.  But the latest flare-up, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant and a spike in asymptomatic cases, is challenging that approach.  Zhang Yan, an official with the Jilin provincial health commission, admitted Sunday that local authorities' virus response so far had been lacking.  ""The emergency response mechanism in some areas is not robust enough, there is insufficient understanding of the characteristics of the Omicron variant ... and judgment has been inaccurate,"" he said at a government press briefing.  Residents of Jilin have completed six rounds of mass testing, local officials said. On Sunday the city reported over 500 cases of the Omicron variant.  The neighbouring city of Changchun - an industrial base of 9 million people - was locked down Friday.  The smaller cities of Siping and Dunhua, both in Jilin province, were locked down Thursday and Friday, according to official announcements.  The mayor of Jilin and the head of the Changchun health commission were dismissed from their jobs Saturday, state media reported, in a sign of the political imperative placed on local authorities to squash virus clusters.  But fatigue with the strict approach has been showing in China, with officials increasingly urging softer and more targeted measures to contain the virus, while economists warn that tough clampdowns are hurting the economy.  As cases have climbed since late February, the response in different parts of the country has been generally softer and more targeted compared to December, when the city of Xi'an and its 13 million people were locked down for two weeks.  In China's biggest city Shanghai, authorities have increasingly moved to temporarily lock down individual schools, businesses, restaurants and malls over close-contact fears rather than mass quarantines.  Long lines have been seen outside hospitals in the city as people rush to obtain a negative COVID-19 test.  As cases rise, the country's National Health Commission announced Friday that they would introduce the use of rapid antigen tests.  The kits will now be available online or at pharmacies for clinics and ordinary citizens to buy for ""self-testing"", the health commission said.  Although nucleic acid tests will continue to be the main method of testing, the move suggests China may be anticipating that official efforts will not be able to contain the virus.  Last week, a top Chinese scientist said the country should aim to co-exist with the virus, like other nations, where Omicron has spread like wildfire.  But the government has also made clear that mass lockdowns remain an option.  Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who frequently telegraphs top-level thinking on the pandemic response, on Saturday urged regions to quickly pounce on and clear outbreaks. "
The lonely envoy: Moscow's man at the UN finds himself on the defensive,2022-03-13 11:41:35+08:00,"UNITED NATIONS: It was the middle of an emergency session of the UN Security Council, late on the evening of Feb 23, and Vassily Nebenzia looked shaken - his face pale, his shoulders sagging.  Russia, the country he represents at the United Nations, had just invaded Ukraine, sending shock waves around the world that continue to reverberate today.  At nearly 60, Nebenzia - a bald man, massively built, who wears thin-framed glasses and often fiddles with his watch - was chairing the Council.  It was a shocking first for the UN: The man presiding over the August body dedicated to defending global peace was also the representative of a nuclear power now waging war against a democracy.  Did he know, when he opened the session and sat listening as his colleagues delivered impassioned pleas for Moscow to pull back the armed forces surrounding much of Ukraine - that they had already invaded?  More generally, does he believe the words in the speeches he reads?  ""I don't know, but I believe not,"" one UN official told AFP, speaking on grounds of anonymity.  Several ambassadors said they shared that impression.  The Ukrainian ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, regularly asks Nebenzia if he is actually in touch with Moscow.  British envoy Barbara Woodward, a specialist in Russian and Chinese affairs, reminded Nebenzia that the great Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote: ""Man is given not only one life, but also one conscience.""  ""I know that you've spoken under instructions today, but I ask you to report faithfully back to Moscow what you have heard today - the urgency of this Council's calls for peace.""  Nebenzia did not respond to an AFP request for an interview. "
"Winter Paralympics to close after Ukraine, China athletes star",2022-03-13 11:22:55+08:00,"BEIJING: The flame will be extinguished on Beijing's Winter Paralympics on Sunday (Mar 13) after a week of stellar performances from the host nation and Ukrainian athletes reeling from Moscow's invasion.  The Bird's Nest stadium will host the closing ceremony where China will hand the baton to Italy's Milano-Cortina, who will stage the 2026 Winter Games.  At the opening ceremony, China's state broadcaster CCTV censored International Paralympic Committee (IPC) President Andrew Parsons' forceful anti-war speech.  More than a week later, CCTV has not responded to the IPC's questions or provided any guarantees that it will not act in similar fashion during the closing ceremony.  The lead-up to the Games was overshadowed by controversy over whether athletes from Russia and ally Belarus should be allowed to compete.  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had urged sporting federations across the world to exclude athletes from those nations.  The IPC initially said it would allow the athletes to compete as neutrals, but after threats of boycotts from other competitors and tensions rising in the athletes' village, organisers banned them from the Games.  After an arduous journey to get to the Chinese capital from their war-torn homeland, Ukraine's athletes lie a remarkable second in the medals table after their best performance in a Winter Paralympics.  One athlete learned her soldier father had been taken prisoner by Russian troops while another won a gold medal days after discovering her home in Kharkiv had been bombed  The team had 28 podium finishes by Sunday morning, including 10 gold medals in biathlon and cross country skiing.  ""To compete here at such a high level knowing their family and nation is under attack is just incredible,"" Parsons told reporters on Saturday.  ""It's one of the most incredible displays of resilience I've ever seen in my life, in or outside of sport.""  Host nation China emerged as the new Winter Paralympics powerhouse - topping the medals table ahead of Ukraine with 18 golds and 59 medals in all.  China made their debut in 2002 but recorded their first gold, in wheelchair curling, at Pyeongchang in South Korea only four years ago. The scale of their success in Beijing has surprised some of their own athletes.  ""We weren't really aware of our level before these Paralympic Games, because we haven't been competing abroad much lately,"" said Liu Sitong, 27, who won two bronze and one silver medal in women's sitting alpine skiing races.  On the last day of competition Sunday, the United States face Canada for para-ice hockey gold after China beat South Korea 4-0 on Saturday to claim the bronze.  ""We want to encourage every person with a disability to live every day positively and believe that everyone has value and can contribute in every field,"" Chinese player Cui Yutao said.  ""We formed the team in 2016 and we've basically been training behind closed doors since. We didn't go home for about three years - all because we were chasing this dream,"" teammate Wang Zhidong said.  There are last-day medals also to be won in skiing's cross country relays and alpine events. "
Kisnorbo hails second half show after City fight back for point,2022-03-13 11:17:19+08:00,"    Melbourne City head coach Patrick Kisnorbo praised his players' second half performance as their best of the season after the reigning A-League champions fought back from two goals down to draw with Western United.  Connor Metcalfe and Jamie Maclaren scored to cancel out efforts from Leo Lacroix and Rene Krhin in Saturday's top-of-the-table clash and the 2-2 draw means City remain at the summit ahead of Western United on goal-difference.  ""I think in the second half we dominated completely,"" said the former Leeds United and Leicester City defender.   ""Sometimes the ball goes in, sometimes it doesn't. It was great character to get back in the game.  ""Sometimes you need a bit of luck for the ball to go in but I'm very happy with how we played, especially in the second half.  ""After the 2-0 we dominated completely. There were shots, chances that on another day could've been something else but at the end of the day we go home 2-2.""  Kisnorbo's side also saw Andrew Nabboutt's early effort cleared off the goal-line while Metcalfe hit the crossbar in their quest for a winner in the final 30 minutes of the game.  The draw halted a run of four straight wins for Western United and means City have now gone six consecutive games without defeat.  ""The way we played, you don't look at chances you look at performance and for me I reckon we played the best football - second half especially - this year,"" said Kisnorbo.   ""The way we were playing, moving the ball quick and on a difficult pitch, I thought we were outstanding.""     (Reporting by Michael Church in Hong Kong, Editing by Richard Pullin) "
"Georgia to face Australia, Fiji and Wales at 2023 World Cup",2022-03-13 11:14:09+08:00,"    Georgia defeated Romania 26-23 in Bucharest on Saturday to seal their spot in Pool C of the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France, where they will take on Australia, Fiji, Wales and another qualifier.  Georgia had already secured qualification for the World Cup because Russia is banned from the 2022 European Championship over its invasion of Ukraine, but their win over Romania ensures they finish atop the continental tournament's standings with eight wins and one draw.  They take on Spain in their final match of the campaign on March 20.  Spain and Portugal, tied on 25 points, face off on Sunday in a bid to finish second and secure direct qualification for the World Cup Pool B alongside defending champions South Africa, Ireland, Scotland and a qualifier.

Australia's COVID-19 vaccine diplomacy in Pacific islands wards off Beijing: PM Morrison,2022-03-13 11:01:07+08:00,"SYDNEY: Australia has been able to stop an ""incursion"" by Beijing into the Pacific islands by talking with leaders there weekly and offering vaccine aid, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday (Mar 13).  Concern over China's military ambitions for the region, after it provided police and riot equipment to the Solomon Islands, prompted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to last month announce Washington would open a Solomon Islands embassy.  Morrison said China had been ""very clear"" about aspirations to build a military base in the Pacific islands, but this had not occurred.  This was because Australia worked closely with the region, including providing COVID-19 vaccines before others could offer support, he said in a TV interview with Nine's Weekend Today.  ""I talk to Pacific leaders every single week and that is what ensures that we can block the incursion into our region, because we share values with the Pacific,"" he said.  Australia is historically the largest aid donor to the Pacific islands, although China has increased infrastructure lending and aid, and provided military equipment to regional hub Fiji.  Beijing has previously said Australia and the United States are ""resurrecting a Cold War mentality"", while China's assistance would ""build a community with a shared future for China and Pacific island countries"".  Tensions between Australia and China, who are significant trading partners, have risen as Beijing sanctioned Australian products in reprisal for Canberra calling for an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Morrison, who faces an election in May, has put his government's tough rhetoric on China at the forefront of his campaign for re-election. "
Two injured in stabbing attack at New York's Museum of Modern Art,2022-03-13 10:13:15+08:00,"NEW YORK: A man stabbed two employees inside the Museum of Modern Art in New York on Saturday (Mar 12) afternoon, leaping over a reception desk to attack them after he was denied entrance for previous incidents of disorderly conduct, authorities said.  Police said the two employees were stabbed multiple times and both were in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital later Saturday. People posting accounts to social media said museumgoers ran for the exits in confusion and chaos after the stabbing.  NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence & Counterterrorism John Miller said the man's membership was revoked for two separate incidents of disorderly behavior at the museum in recent days. He was being sought.  “He became upset about not being allowed entrance, and then jumped over the reception desk and proceeded to attack and stab two employees of the museum multiple times,” Miller said.  Miller said the employees were stabbed in the back, in the collar bone, in the back of neck and were rushed within minutes to Bellevue.  Miller said police trying to locate the man had access to video of him leaving the museum and were aware of the direction in which he left.  He did not identify the man by name but described him as a white male wearing a black jacket, blue surgical mask, a colorfully patterned shirt and hood. Miller said the man was a “regular” at the museum, and that the museum had adequate security.  Social media posts on Twitter showed that the midtown Manhattan museum had evacuated its patrons Saturday afternoon. One of the videos posted online showed police vehicles, their emergency lights flashing, thronging the outside of the museum as dozens of patrons hurried away amid a light snowfall.  Law enforcement officials are investigating the attack, and the names of the employees were not immediately released.  Mayor Eric Adams tweeted Saturday evening that he had been briefed on the attack and said the injuries to the two victims were not life-threatening. “We're grateful for the quick work of our first responders,"" he added.  MoMA, founded in 1929, is one of New York City's top tourist attractions, and drew more than 700,000 visitors in 2020. Its collection of modern art includes The Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh and works by Henri Matisse and Paul Gaugin. "
'Mission impossible': UN in Cambodia showed early limit of nation building,2022-03-13 09:56:12+08:00,"PHNOM PENH: Just over 30 years ago, a crackling radio in a refugee camp on the Thai border brought Sam Sophal word that the United Nations was coming to his war-ravaged homeland of Cambodia.   For Sam Sophal, who survived the Khmer Rouge genocide only because his mother bribed Khmer Rouge executioners with her silver watch, the promise of peace was irresistible.  The UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) arrived on Mar 15, 1992, with great expectations, the first UN nation-building operation after the collapse of the Soviet Union sparked hope that democracy would flourish around the world.  But long before last year's shambolic fall of Afghanistan and the costly international missions in Iraq, Kosovo and elsewhere, Cambodia would serve as an early warning of the flaws and limitations of nation building.   At the time, UNTAC was the most ambitious and expensive UN mission but despite its US$1.6 billion cost and US$20 billion in subsequent international aid, hopes of creating a vibrant democracy faded long ago.  ""I felt very proud during the UNTAC time because I was the first generation to bring peace to Cambodia,"" says Sam Sophal, 60, who got a job as a translator with the mission soon after its launch.  ""Now I see we have gone backwards. To one-party rule,"" he said under the shade of a Jujube tree in his Phnom Penh backyard.  Prime Minister Hun Sen, the same man in power before the UNTAC mission, remains leader, presiding over what critics call an authoritarian government with most opposition leaders in exile or in jail.   Government spokesman Phay Siphan rejects accusations that Hun Sen is an autocrat, saying he has worked for peace and democracy since 1979.  The United Nations said in a statement UNTAC's original mandate of ""restoring to the Cambodian people and their democratically elected leaders their primary responsibility for peace, stability, national reconciliation and reconstruction had been fulfilled"".   A prophecy that foretold of a ""god with blue eyes"" that would one day bless and restore the land had spread through villages during Cambodia's darkest years.  So when UNTAC arrived with their sky-blue flag and helmets they were seen as an incarnation of that deity, some even painting their homes a UN shade of blue, recalled Youk Chhang, executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia.   ""Conflict, genocide, invasions, refugees ... and then suddenly there was blue sky,"" he said.  A former French colony, by the early 1990s Cambodia had endured decades of devastation after getting sucked into the Vietnam War. During the four-year Khmer Rouge ""killing fields"" regime an estimated 1.7 million people, about a fifth of the population, perished.  A Vietnamese invasion toppled the Khmer Rouge in 1979, setting off a war in which the ousted Maoists and two other factions battled the invaders and their Cambodian allies.  UNTAC's main triumphs were bringing hundreds of thousands of refugees home from border camps in time for the May 1993 election, when almost 90 per cent of voters turned out.  ""For the first time we felt very free,"" said Youk Chhang, who spent two weeks in an electoral office guarding ballots.  ""It was a beautiful feeling.""  But Hun Sen, prime minister before UNTAC, came second and quickly complained of vote-rigging. The polls, he said, were worse than the pain of losing an eye in battle.  Threatening to break up the country, Hun Sen forced a power-sharing deal that saw the man who had won the vote, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and Hun Sen taking the roles of first and second prime ministers.   ""In the world there is no such thing as two prime ministers,"" said Sam Sophal, still bemused by the arrangement.  ""Think about one car and two drivers, who is going to take over?""   The coalition eventually disintegrated in bloodshed, with armed forces loyal to Hun Sen ousting Ranariddh in a 1997 coup.  In retrospect, UNTAC was criticised for caving in to Hun Sen and then just leaving in September 1993. But even at the time, many say it was evident its mandate was fanciful.  ""The people who planned it were out of their minds. It was definitely a mission impossible,"" says academic and author Craig Etcheson.  ""To expect all these people to parachute into a destroyed country, an alien culture with no language skills and to accomplish anything was pretty crazy.""  UNTAC's goal of democracy was always complicated by Hun Sen ambition.  ""He was so far from being a democrat that you knew it wasn’t likely to end well,"" recalled Tim Carney, who ran UNTAC's information division. He now describes Hun Sen as a ""dictator"".   Hun Sen is one of the world's longest serving leaders and presides over a single-party parliament.  In 2017, a court dissolved the main opposition party while a feisty media that blossomed under UNTAC was tamed.  Since the great Cambodian experiment, democracy has been in retreat around the world.  According to the Bertelsmann Transformation Index, for the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies.    Like many U.N. missions, expectations in Cambodia were improbably high, said ex-military observer J Floyd Carter, who was detained by the Khmer Rouge during his UNTAC posting.   ""Having been in Cambodia and then in Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, Haiti, there were similar disappointments ... It achieves 55 per cent of what it sets out to do,"" Carter said of the United Nations.  Carney said the United Nations was more realistic these days. Following last year's coup in South Sudan, it prioritised dialogue rather than democratic masterplans.   ""They are just trying to get a conversation started,"" he said. ""Which in my mind is about the most that foreigners can do.""  When UNTAC was wound up, it left Cambodia with a fraught political arrangement that was almost bound to go awry.  ""UNTAC was the first test,"" says Sam Sophal, ""But they didn't complete the mission"".  Now retired after 24 years with the United Nations, Sam Sophal says corruption and nepotism have left Cambodians with no political alternatives.   ""People in this country believe in democracy and human rights but who is going to lead them?"" he asked.

Its success was closely tied to the force of its theme song, composed and performed by Shabir, who was also one of the show’s lead actors.  Over the years, the song hasn’t waned in popularity, and neither has the show.  Three seasons of Vettai are now available on Netflix, making it accessible to a new range of audiences.  Vettai’s fifth season has just been released and stars Eswari Gunasagar, Gunalan Morgan, Vignesh Wadarajan and Thavanesan Sivananthan as investigators of new crimes. “Vettai” is Tamil for “the hunt”.  Concurrently, Shabir has released what he calls his “fifth and final” rendition of the theme song. And for the first time, the Vettai song is available to download on all music streaming platforms.

Tens of thousands march for the climate in France,2022-03-13 09:45:52+08:00,"PARIS: Tens of thousands of people protested across France on Saturday (Mar 12) to call for more attention to the climate crisis in the runup to presidential polls next month.  ""Look up"", read one message in giant orange letters demonstrators held up in Paris, urging politicians to make protecting the planet a priority.  The sign was a nod to Netflix hit Don't Look Up, in which astronomers who discover a comet will wipe out the earth try in vain to get politicians to take the threat seriously.  ""When are we going to talk about it?"" read another sign.  The climate crisis took up only 1.5 per cent of talking points in media coverage of the election campaign from Feb 28 to Mar 6, a recent survey by climate justice non-governmental organisations has found.  Organisers said 80,000 protesters took part across the country, including 32,000 people in Paris. The interior ministry however said just around 40,000 demonstrated, of whom 11,000 in the capital.  In the northern city of Lille, Lydie Lampin Bernand described the climate crisis as ""worse than critical"".  ""I'm only 34 years old, and even I've seen the planet slapped in the face with a shovel,"" she said.  ""We have to protect the land we'll leave to our children,"" she added, but politicians had not so far shown they were up to tackling the challenge. "
Brits to get £350 a month to open homes to Ukraine refugees,2022-03-13 08:50:08+08:00,"LONDON: Britain will pay people to open their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion as the government moves to deflect anger over its response to the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.  The new scheme called ""Homes for Ukraine"" will let refugees from the war come to Britain even if they do not have family ties, the government said on Sunday (Mar 13).  Britain will pay people £350 pounds (US$456) a month if they can offer refugees a spare room or property for a minimum period of six months.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sought to portray Britain as helping lead the global response to the Russian invasion - which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" - but his government has faced criticism over delays in accepting refugees.  Lawmakers from all the main political parties have attacked the government's insistence that Ukrainians seek visas and biometric tests before arriving in Britain, saying this prioritised bureaucracy over the welfare of those fleeing war.  Under the new scheme, members of the public, charities, businesses and community groups should be able to offer accommodation via a web page by the end of next week, the government said. "
Houston we have lift off as Windies Bonner named Player of Match,2022-03-13 08:09:13+08:00,"    West Indies' Nkrumah Bonner has come a long way since plying his trade in the cricket backwater of Texas four years ago and was named Player of the Match as the hosts escaped with a draw in the first test against England on Saturday.  After a nine hour-plus marathon knock of 123 in the first innings, 33-year-old Bonner offered more stout resistance to stave off England's quest for victory in the second.  He played the straightest of bats in taking 34 balls to get off the mark, eventually remaining unbeaten on 38 in North Sound on the island of Antigua. [L2N2VF0BI]  ""I like to bat at this venue. I think it's a very good wicket,"" said Bonner, whose previous century also came at the ground named after the great Viv Richards.  ""I just want to play test cricket. Over the years I've developed that discipline to bat long.""  Bonner's current status is a far cry from 2018, when he played in the Houston League for the Knight Riders.  He made his test debut last February, and in 10 tests has a batting average of nearly 50.  ""I'm very versatile. I adapt to the situation. Obviously the goal is to bat a lot of balls,"" he said.   West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said Bonner had told him before the match that he wanted to bat for at least 300 balls, something he accomplished and then some.  ""The determination he had was an example for us first innings and today he came again and really showed his worth,"" Brathwaite said.  ""He has a special mindset and set an example for us to follow.""     (Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Ken Ferris) "
"After test draw, Root pleased England did not panic against Windies",2022-03-13 07:54:54+08:00,"    England captain Joe Root was disappointed his team could not finish off West Indies on the final day of the first test on Saturday but was hardly going to complain after a winter of discontent.  England, under plenty of scrutiny at the best of times, arrived in the Caribbean even more so after a 4-0 Ashes drubbing by Australia.  ""I'm really proud of the team today, the (whole) week actually,"" Root said after the match finished in a draw, England coming up six wickets short of bowling out West Indies in the second innings on the island of Antigua.  ""From that first hour when we found ourselves in a tricky spot (losing four quick wickets), I think the character we showed off the back of the previous tour to not panic and get ourselves back in the game ... we got better and better on a very docile wicket for our seamers.  ""(There are a) lot of good signs going into the rest of the series.""  England's cause was not helped by the absence in the second innings of Mark Wood, out with a right elbow injury that Root said would be evaluated before the second test starting in Barbados on Wednesday.  Wood's presence might not have made much difference in the end, but it certainly did not help the cause.  ""On that sort of wicket the extra bit of pace with the reverse (swing) is exactly what you want,"" said Root.  The captain, one of three century-makers on the England team, heaped praise on the other two, veteran Jonny Bairstow and young Zak Crawley.  Bairstow, coming off a century in his final test in Australia, was ultra-cautious early before cutting loose later in his knock of 140 in the first innings.  ""Jonny, to read the game and play that kind of innings in that situation, showed great maturity and you could see the confidence he took from the way he played in the back end of Australia,"" said Root.  Crawley's 121 in the second innings provided evidence of why England stuck with him after a long lean spell that followed a double century against Pakistan in 2020.  ""(Crawley) showed a huge amount of character to stand up as one of the more senior batters now within this team,"" said Root.  ""It was really important he played an innings like that, more for himself, not necessarily for the rest of us (because) we know how talented he is and what he's capable of.""

But Bergeson’s splurge didn’t reflect a slavish devotion to basketball; he opened his wallet because he felt insecure about his languishing relationship with his friend, who he perceived to be getting closer to a new group of people.  “He started hanging out with the dads on his daughter’s soccer team and talking about them fondly and I thought, ‘Oh, man he’s kind of got some new friends,’” Bergeson, 42, a business consultant in Denver, said. “I needed to insert myself to make sure I still mattered to him.”  Just like you can lose a romantic partner to another person, “friends can also lose their slot in the best friend hierarchy,” said Jaimie Krems, a friendship researcher and assistant professor of psychology at Oklahoma State University. This fear of being replaced is often borne out of jealousy, Krems said. And one way to cope with it, she added, is by doing something social scientists refer to as friend guarding – actions like excessively praising a friend or cutting down a new rival, for example – to maintain a threatened relationship.  “Like all behaviours, there are good and bad aspects of friend guarding,” Krems said. Telling your friend how much they mean to you might bolster your friendship, she said, but badmouthing a newbie might anger your friend and cause them to pull away. "
"Looks hard, but anyone can do it: Here's how to master the pull-up",2022-03-13 07:05:34+08:00,"I’ve always loved pull-ups, partly out of spite. There is a common fitness refrain that women can’t do them, and I don’t like to be told I can’t do something – especially if the reason is my gender. As a teenager, I pushed lawn-mowers and hauled rocks just to show that being a girl didn’t mean I was weak.  I love how pull-ups make me feel – powerful, strong. There’s nothing like the feeling of lifting yourself up. Pull-ups are also beautiful for their simplicity. They require nothing more than a bar, and engage at least a dozen muscles, from the lats all the way to the glutes. Experts say they improve upper body strength, shoulder mobility and core stability, while helping to hone coordination too.  Doing a pull-up is “an amazing feeling,” said Chilasa King, a powerlifter and coach at LiftedMBK in New York. The exercise boosts confidence and turns heads at the gym, she said. “It’s a simple exercise that’s really hard to do.”  Therein lies the pull-up paradox: Pull-ups are simple, but hard, and many people who think they can’t do one really could, if they put in the effort and time.  Everybody has a good chance of achieving a pull-up if they train for it, said Meghan Callaway, a strength coach based in Vancouver, Canada, and creator of The Ultimate Pull-Up Program. Most people who fail to master the pull-up struggle not because they are physically incapable, but because they are not training in the right way, she said. The trick is to focus on proper technique and approach your training with patience and deliberateness.

Milan squeeze past Empoli to move five points clear,2022-03-13 06:53:49+08:00,"ROME: AC Milan will stay top of Serie A this weekend after Saturday's tight 1-0 win over Empoli moved them five points clear of the chasing pack.  Pierre Kalulu struck the classy winner 18 minutes in at the San Siro when a free-kick fell to him just outside the area, the French defender's first goal of the season keeping Milan's local rivals Inter at bay.  Inter, who have a game in hand, are at Torino on Sunday while Napoli are a further point back in third ahead of a tricky trip to Verona.  Milan have had trouble with Serie A's lesser lights in recent weeks and Saturday's win was far from straightforward, with promoted Empoli causing problems for the hosts in the second half.  Aurelio Andreazzoli's team are without a win since mid-December but went close twice in a matter of seconds shortly after the break.  First Sebastiano Luperto forced a superb save from Mike Maignan when he got a head to Filippo Bandinelli's inswinging cross five minutes after the restart.  Then France international goalkeeper Maignan had to be at his best to keep Nedim Bajrami's subsequent corner from going straight in before pouncing on the ball on the rebound.  However Milan held on for a precious win to make sure that they will hold top spot, at least for another week.  Alvaro Morata ensured Juventus extended their unbeaten run to 15 matches with a brace in a 3-1 win at Sampdoria to further strengthen their position in the top four as they moved just one point behind Napoli.  Morata put Juve two goals ahead from the penalty spot before rounding off the scoring two minutes from the end to send Juve into their Champions League decider with Villarreal in confident mood.  Massimiliano Allegri's side host La Liga outfit Villarreal in Turin on Wednesday in the second leg of a last 16 tie level at 1-1.  The visitors could thank Samp's Japanese international Maya Yoshida for their first goal after the defender inadvertently bundled in a Juan Cuadrado cross in the 23rd minute, before Morata converted his spot-kick 11 minutes later.  Abdelhamid Sabiri pulled one back for Samp with six minutes to go with a deflected free-kick but shortly afterwards Morata headed in his fifth league goal of the season from a Manuel Locatelli cross.  Morata's second sealed a win which showed Juve are not out of the title race yet, pulling to within four points of Milan before they beat Empoli.  The Spaniard is on loan from Atletico Madrid and his future in Turin after this campaign is unsure.  ""The future is not up to me. I'll still be the biggest Juve fan even if I'm not here next season,"" he said to DAZN.  ""We will try everything we can to win the league title.""  Earlier bottom side Salernitana held Sassuolo to a 2-2 draw while Spezia struck a big blow in the race for survival by beating Cagliari 2-0.  Thiago Motta's side are seven points above Venezia, who sit 18th but can now move level on 25 points with Cagliari if they shock Lazio in Rome on Sunday. "
"UK to host Baltic, Nordic leaders to find new ways to isolate Russia",2022-03-13 06:53:36+08:00,"LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will host leaders from countries along Russia's northwestern flank next week to discuss ways they can respond to President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, including finding new ways to isolate Russia's economy.

The leaders are expected to agree to more military exercises in the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea and will discuss the war in Ukraine and energy security, Johnson's office said.  ""European security has been shaken by the attack of Russia on Ukraine, and alongside our partners, we will take action to ensure we emerge stronger and more united than before,"" Johnson said in a statement.

IEA urges reduced transport to cut oil use amid supply crunch,2022-03-18 17:56:07+08:00,"LONDON: The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday (Mar 18) unveiled a 10-point plan to reduce oil use focused mostly on reducing transportation as Russia's invasion of Ukraine deepens concerns about supply.  ""Since the majority of oil demand comes from transport, the IEA’s 10-Point Plan focuses on how to use less oil getting people and goods from A to B, drawing on concrete measures that have already been put to use in a diverse range of countries and cities,"" the IEA said in a report.  The recommendations could reduce oil demand by 2.7 million barrels a day within four months, the IEA said, with measures including lower speed limits, working from home, car-free days in cities, cheaper public transport and more carpooling.

China's land sales plunged in Jan-Feb though easing measures,2022-03-18 17:16:08+08:00,"BEIJING :     China's land sales revenue slumped from a year earlier, official data for January-February showed on Friday, pointing to continued weakness in the country's huge property market, a major economic growth driver.  The country's government land sales revenue fell 29.5per cent on year to 792.2 billion yuan  ($124.52 billion) in the first two months of 2022 after a 2.16per cent increase in December, largely smaller than 1.1236 trillion in the same period in 2021.  China's property sector has slumped for months as Beijing's campaign to reduce high debt levels triggered a liquidity crisis at some major property developers, resulting in bond defaults and projects being shelved or left unfinished.  Authorities have put in place a string of easing steps to ease a liquidity crunch in major property developers and revive buying interest, including smaller downpayments and reductions in mortgage rates.  The looser regulations have yet to drive a nationwide rebound. New home prices stalled in February after eking out a small gain a month earlier, official data on Wednesday showed.  The year-on-year decline in property sales and new construction starts measured by floor space were in two digits in January-February, according to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics.  Later on Wednesday, state-run Xinhua news agency reported China was putting a planned property tax trial this year on ice, citing the finance ministry, suggesting authorities are moving cautiously to refrain from further hurting the interest in the sector.  Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Wednesday urged the roll-out of market-friendly policies to support the economy, and vowed to tackle the risks in the property sector.

"Former DBS manager given prohibition orders after deceiving clients into transferring S$490,000 to personal bank account",2022-03-18 17:11:12+08:00,"SINGAPORE: A former wealth planning manager with DBS Bank has been issued 10-year prohibition orders after deceiving clients into transferring a total of S$490,000 into his personal bank account.  Marcus Loh Thim Mun was issued the prohibition orders by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The orders took effect on Wednesday (Mar 16) after Loh was convicted of cheating and forgery offences, and using the benefits of his criminal conduct.  On Jan 6, 2021, Loh was sentenced in court to 33 months imprisonment for his offences.  Between October 2018 and November 2018, Loh deceived seven clients into transferring a total of S$490,000 into his personal bank account while he was a DBS representative.  Loh falsely informed some of these clients that their money would be placed in fixed deposit accounts with DBS, said MAS.   He also told a client that he could participate in a DBS share ownership scheme, and he forged a letter confirming the placement of the client’s money in the scheme.   He then used part of the money to purchase virtual credits on an unlawful gambling site.   ""Loh’s actions have given MAS reason to believe that he will not perform financial advisory and capital markets services honestly,"" said MAS.  “While Loh is no longer an appointed representative in Singapore, the prohibition orders were issued against him to safeguard the integrity of Singapore’s financial sector.”  Under the prohibition orders, Loh cannot provide any financial advisory services, take part in the management of, act as a director of, or become a substantial shareholder of any financial advisory firm under the Financial Advisers Act 2001, said MAS.   He is also not allowed to perform any regulated activity or take part in the management, act as a director, or become a substantial shareholder of any capital markets services firm under the Securities and Futures Act 2001.

ADB to help Indonesia raise funding for new $32 billion capital city,2022-03-18 17:01:26+08:00,"JAKARTA :     The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will assist in Indonesia's planned $32 billion capital city relocation by mobilising financing and assessing the project's environmental and social impacts, the Manila-based lender said on Friday.   The multilateral bank said in a statement it will also help with the design of the new city, Nusantara, that President Joko Widodo wants to build in the eastern part of forested Borneo island.  When asked whether the ADB will extend a loan to Indonesia for the relocation, the lender said its support will be ""technical, including in setting up an international conference"" but did not provide further details.  ""ADB will share international lessons learned to help NNCA design and fund construction of the new capital,"" said senior ADB official Ahmed M. Saeed, referring to Nusantara National Capital Authority, a government agency in charge of the project.      The bank's statement followed an announcement from Japan's Softbank Group that it would not invest in Nusantara, despite previous remarks by an Indonesian minister that the group had offered billions of dollars for the project.   The NNCA is headed by Bambang Susantono, a former vice president for ADB and former deputy transport minister for Indonesia.   Susantono was quoted in Friday's ADB statement as saying he was keen to learn about others' experiences in creating carbon-neutral and inclusive cities.  Jokowi, as the president is commonly known, has said he wants the government to finance only about a fifth of the cost of the new capital city, and that private and foreign investors should bankroll the rest.  Indonesia's sovereign wealth fund will invest in the new capital city if it sees the project as commercially viable, the head of the fund told Reuters this week.   The government aims to start construction soon and civil servants are expected to move from the current capital, Jakarta,  to Nusantara in 2024.

"JPM, Credit Suisse expect China COVID spike to have minimal impact on GDP",2022-03-18 16:47:38+08:00,"    The recent surge in COVID-19 cases across China is likely to have a minimal impact on the country's GDP this year, two brokerages said in their reports, while adding it could hurt demand for some commodities.  China reported 2,388 new local cases with confirmed symptoms on March 17, almost double the count a day earlier, as it battles its worst coronavirus outbreak since the virus first emerged in Wuhan in 2020.  Credit Suisse said in a report late Thursday it expected a loss of 0.03 to 0.05 percentage point to GDP growth per week of the lockdown, on the current size of the lockdown.   Earlier this month, China forecast a slower economic growth of around 5.5per cent this year as domestic headwinds, including a downturn in the country's vast real estate sector and lacklustre consumption, cast a pall on its outlook.  ""We view China's recent COVID cases and restrictions as a potential demand-side shock that could partly offset the Russia/Ukraine supply-side shock to some commodities,"" Credit Suisse economists said.  Separately, J.P.Morgan said it expected 20per cent of China's GDP to undergo a ""more severe economic shock"" associated with the ""zero-COVID"" policy, but expected it to recover in May and June.  The brokerage forecasts China's full-year GDP growth to be 4.9per cent, down from its previous estimate of 5.1per cent.     (Reporting by Siddarth S in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi Aich) "
Porsche AG sets more ambitious electric vehicle target,2022-03-18 17:03:29+08:00,"FRANKFURT: Luxury sportscar maker Porsche AG, which parent Volkswagen could float in a partial stock market listing later this year, on Friday (Mar 18) set out a more ambitious sales target for electric vehicles.  More than 80 per cent of newly sold Porsche vehicles will be fully-electric in 2030, Porsche AG chief executive Oliver Blume said at the group's annual press conference.  That target previously applied to Porsche's electrified models overall, which also includes plug-in hybrids.  Porsche AG also stuck to its long-term target of an operating margin of at least 15 per cent, finance chief Lutz Meschke said.  Volkswagen and its top shareholder Porsche SE struck a framework agreement for a potential partial listing of Porsche AG, which could value the division at up to 90 billion euros.  Such a listing would include listing up to 25 per cent of Porsche AG's preferred stock, selling 25 per cent plus 1 ordinary share in the carmaker to Porsche SE and paying out 49 per cent of IPO proceeds to Volkswagen's shareholders as a special dividend.

"Man jailed more than 13 years for stabbing, slashing NParks safe distancing officer in 'merciless' attack",2022-03-18 16:28:13+08:00,"SINGAPORE: A 62-year-old man who stabbed and slashed a safe distancing enforcement officer during an outing to pick pandan leaves was on Friday (Mar 18) sentenced to 13 years and four months' imprisonment.  Ahirrudin Al-Had Haji Arrifin attacked the National Parks Board (NParks) officer at Sungei Serangoon Park on May 4, 2020 after he was asked to put on a mask and told that he could not harvest pandan leaves there.  The 38-year-old victim's left thumb was almost severed in the attack. He suffered serious injuries to both hands as well as his chest, arm and scalp, undergoing surgery and receiving 89 days of medical leave.  Ahirrudin, who was a rag-and-bone man, last week pleaded guilty to one count each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, unlawfully possessing a scheduled weapon and violating COVID-19 control orders by not wearing a mask.  He attacked the victim with a nearly 1m-long walking stick that contained a 20.8cm-long blade at its lower end, concealed by a wooden sheath. The judge said this length of a blade ""essentially transformed the walking stick into a spear"".  He also used a karambit knife with a 10cm curved blade, which was hidden in his shoe. He had brought along two such knives to cut the pandan leaves.  ""The accused's attack was simply senseless, abhorrent and callous,"" said Justice Tan Siong Thye in delivering his judgment. The assault was ""brutal and unprovoked"", and a ""wholly unjustifiable response"" to the victim's performance of his official duties, he said.  The judge also pointed out the public interest considerations around the case. The attack took place during Singapore's ""circuit breaker"", when the work of safe distancing enforcement officers was especially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19, he said.  ""Such frontline enforcement officers were and still remain exceptionally susceptible to abuse and violence, yet they continue to place their health and personal safety at risk to enforce social distancing measures that protect the society,"" said Justice Tan.  He said the sentence imposed was necessary to assure public servants of adequate protection and vindication by the law when performing their duties.  Details of the attack were heard in court last week. The victim was driving through the park connector in a buggy with another NParks safe distancing enforcement officer when he spotted Ahirrudin unmasked, with pandan leaves in his bicycle basket.  The two officers approached the man, telling him that he was not allowed to cut the pandan leaves at the park connector and asking him to wear a mask. Ahiruddin was uncooperative and grew increasingly agitated.  After the victim called the police and took a video of him, Ahiruddin unsheathed the blade of his walking stick and stabbed the left side of the victim's chest. He later entered the buggy and forcefully pushed the blade further in at least two more times.  Both men fell out of the buggy onto the grass. During the struggle, Ahiruddin retrieved a karambit knife from his shoe and slashed the victim with it, almost severing the man's left thumb.  Throughout this ""merciless"" onslaught, the victim did not retaliate and only tried to fend off his attacker, who took advantage of his vulnerability, said Justice Tan.  They continued struggling until a passer-by intervened. The victim, his fellow officer and the passer-by ran to Tampines Expressway to wait for an ambulance and the police.  After the attack, Ahirrudin cycled home and hid the walking stick in a compartment at the washing area of the void deck. He was arrested later that afternoon outside a convenience store.  Justice Tan questioned why Ahirrudin had so many weapons on him, saying: ""I wonder why the accused was heavily armed that day. If he wanted only to cut pandan leaves, he would just need a knife ... Why is there a need to bring along so many dangerous weapons for his protection, when his sole purpose was to cut pandan leaves?""  The judge cited a medical report stating that the stabs to the victim's chest could have been fatal if the blade had entered his heart. The victim's hand injuries could also have been life-threatening and caused a massive haemorrhage if not for the prompt medical attention he received. It was ""incredibly fortunate"" that this did not happen.  He also noted comments by Dr Kang Yong Chiang of Singapore General Hospital that the depths of the victim's wounds in his left hand were typically caused by ""industrial tools like electric chain saws"", and a ""large degree of violence"" was involved in their creation.  The injuries have caused lifelong effects to the victim, the judge noted. Despite months of rehabilitation, the victim still suffers diminished strength in his left hand and fingers, causing permanent inconvenience in daily life. He continues to experience psychological trauma and feels anxious whenever he sees knives, even in his own home.  In imposing the sentence, Justice Tan noted that the offender was over the age of 50 and could not be caned. The total sentence included three months' jail given in lieu of the 18 strokes he would have received.  The prosecution had sought 12 to 15 years' jail, arguing that public interest was one of the main considerations for sentencing, as Ahirrudin's actions ""undermined"" the safety and confidence of safe distancing officers.  In mitigation, Ahiruddin's defence lawyer had said the man was deeply remorseful and that his attack on the victim was impulsive, without premeditation. The lawyer had asked for eight to 10 years' jail. "
"China seen keeping lending benchmarks steady, cut expectations grow: Reuters poll",2022-03-18 16:51:01+08:00,"SHANGHAI :     China is likely to keep benchmark lending rates unchanged at its monthly fixing on Monday, a Reuters survey found, after the central bank surprised investors by forgoing a cut to medium-term lending rates this week.  The poll nevertheless found expectations for cuts growing after Vice Premier Liu He on Wednesday said Beijing would roll out more support measures for the Chinese economy.  Among 36 financial institutions surveyed in a snap Reuters poll, just over half said they expected China's one-year loan prime rate (LPR) and the five-year rate to remain unchanged at the March fixing.   Five respondents said they anticipated a 5 basis point reduction in the five-year rate and no change in the one-year rate.   ""I think they'll cut the five-year, since the one-year follows the MLF,"" said a trader at a Chinese bank. ""They want to stabilise the property market so it's more important to cut the five-year.""  The central bank surprised markets on Tuesday by not cutting its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) rate, despite growing risks to the economic outlook, including mounting COVID-19 disruptions, increasing global risks from the Ukraine conflict and a weak property market.  Reflecting market uncertainty, other respondents predicted a wide range of different cuts.   Four respondents expected a 5 basis point cut in the one-year rate, but no change in the five-year, and six respondents said they expected at least one of the rates to be cut by 10 basis points.  Regardless of whether Monday's fixing brings a cut, investors see Liu's comments as having boosted the likelihood of other easing measures, particularly as China struggles with a worsening COVID-19 outbreak.  ""Given strict social distancing measures, it is likely that more cities could find themselves being put under 'semi-lockdown',"" analysts at ING said in a note.  ""We expect the central bank to respond with targeted (reserve requirement ratio) cuts aimed at supporting small and medium-sized enterprises.""  Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of home mortgages.   The one-year LPR is 3.7per cent following cuts of 5 and 10 basis points in December and January, respectively, while the five-year LPR is 4.6per cent after a 5-basis-point cut in January.  The MLF rate serves as a guide to the LPR, which is decided on the 20th of each month.     (Reporting by Steven Bian, Jason Xue and Andrew Galbraith; editing by Barbara Lewis) "
Japan steps up rhetoric against sharp yen falls,2022-03-18 18:00:39+08:00,"TOKYO :Japan is watching recent falls in the yen carefully as sharp moves are ""undesirable,"" the government's top spokesman said on Friday, stepping up official warnings to markets against pushing down the currency too much.  A weak yen has become a source of worry for policymakers as it inflates already surging fuel and raw material import costs, threatening to derail Japan's fragile economic recovery.  ""Exchange-rate stability is important and sharp moves are undesirable,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference.  ""The government will be vigilant to the impact currency market developments, including recent yen declines, could have on the economy.""  Matsuno's warning against sharp yen falls was stronger than recent comments by Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki, who said only that exchange-rate stability was important.  It also contrasted with the fairly sanguine view offered by Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who said on Friday that a weak yen was generally positive for Japan's economy.  The dollar stood at 118.775 yen on Friday, not far from the six-year high of 119.13 yen reached on Wednesday, as the BOJ left monetary policy ultra-loose in the wake of the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates.  The yen has lost more than 3per cent to the dollar so far this month alone.  Kuroda said on Friday the BOJ will maintain ultra-easy policy even though rising fuel costs may drive up inflation to its 2per cent target from April, making it an outlier in a global wave of central banks tightening policy.  Kuroda, a former top currency diplomat, said the yen likely won't weaken further due to interest-rate differentials alone.  ""A weak yen is basically positive for Japan's economy, though the direct impact on households and some companies may not necessarily be beneficial,"" he said.  Japanese policymakers have historically battled sharp yen rises that threaten to damage exports by issuing verbal warnings or currency intervention, while keeping a hands-off approach on yen falls.  But the yen's recent weakness has drawn concern from politicians, who worry about the damage it could do to households and retailers via higher fuel and food costs.  Kuroda said there was little the BOJ can do to arrest an unwelcome fall in the yen.  ""Exchange rate policy falls upon the jurisdiction of the finance ministry. The BOJ does not need to, and does not have the power to influence exchange rates,"" he said.

Chinese carrier sails through Taiwan Strait hours before Biden-Xi call,2022-03-18 18:17:30+08:00,"TAIPEI: A Chinese aircraft carrier sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday (Mar 18), Taiwan's Defence Ministry said, just hours before the Chinese and US presidents were due to talk.  China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has over the past two years stepped up its military activity near the island to assert its sovereignty claims, alarming Taipei and Washington.  A source with direct knowledge of the matter, who was not authorised to speak to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the carrier Shandong sailed close to the Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen, which sits directly opposite the Chinese city of Xiamen.  ""Around 10.30am the CV-17 appeared around 30 nautical miles to the southwest of Kinmen, and was photographed by a passenger on a civilian flight,"" the source said, referring to the Shandong's official service number.  The USS Ralph Johnson, an Arleigh Burke guided missile destroyer, shadowed the carrier, which did not have aircraft on its deck and sailed north through the strait, the source added.  Taiwan also sent warships to keep an eye on the situation, the source said.  Taiwan's Defence Ministry, in a brief statement, confirmed the passage of the Shandong but gave no details other than to say its forces have a ""full grasp"" of what China's ships and aircraft do in the Taiwan Strait.  US Navy spokesperson Lt Mark Langford said the Ralph Johnson had ""conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit Mar 17 (local time) through international waters in accordance with international law"". He did not elaborate.  Chinese Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian referred questions to the Defence Ministry - which did not immediately responded to a request for comment - but said the Shandong has a ""routine training schedule"".  ""We should not associate this with the communication between the heads of state of China and the United States. You may think it is too sensitive. What is sensitive is you, not the Taiwan Strait,"" Zhao told reporters in Beijing. "

""The Wanda Diamond League meetings accepted the recommendation of the board that Authorised Neutral Athletes (ANA) and Belarus athletes be excluded from all Diamond League meetings for the foreseeable future,"" organisers said.  ""This recommendation... reflects the practical and logistical issues meetings may face if ANA athletes from Russia and athletes from Belarus were to be invited to compete.  The Russian Athletics Federation has been suspended from World Athletics since 2015 due to doping violations, and its competitors have not been allowed to compete under the country's flag at international events.  The International Olympic Committee has recommended that events in Russia be cancelled or relocated and that Russian and Belarusian athletes not take part or compete under a neutral flag.  Many sports bodies have moved events and suspended Russian and Belarusian teams or athletes from competing while sponsors have ended contracts in protests against the war.  Russian and Belarusian athletes are also excluded from the World Athletics Indoor Championships, which begin on Friday in Belgrade.

Life echoes art for Ukraine's Eurovision refugee,2022-03-18 22:11:47+08:00,"ISTANBUL :     Six years ago Ukrainian singer Jamala conquered Europe with a song about Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's deportation of hundreds of thousands of people from her Black Sea homeland of Crimea in World War Two.  ""When strangers are coming, they come to your house. They kill you all and say 'We're not guilty',"" she sang in a sombre anthem that was the surprise 2016 winner of the Eurovision Song Contest, usually a feast of light-hearted camp.   Now Jamala is a refugee herself after fleeing Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, which drove her and her children to seek shelter outside Ukraine.   ""On February 24 my husband woke me up and told me that the war had started and that Russia had attacked us. At that moment, I was shocked. It felt like a nightmare,"" she told Reuters in an interview in Istanbul.   The 38-year-old, whose real name is Susana Jamaladinova, sheltered in a Kyiv bomb shelter before escaping to Turkey with her two children - leaving her husband to fight the approaching  Russian army.   The journey to safety was not easy, and she sang to her children to distract them from the danger.  ""We were in the car and we heard this bzzzz noise. We saw (a rocket) in front of us,"" she said, describing her confusion about whether to press on or turn back. ""I was lost, but I had to go forward. It was scary.""  Jamala, a Crimean Tatar whose relatives were victims of the 1944 deportations, urged Europeans to unite behind her country.   ""It is not only a Ukrainian war, it is war against European values,"" she said. ""I think we are all in the same boat.""  She took that message earlier this month to Berlin, where she performed her 2016 song again at a preliminary round of this year's Eurovision - this time to promote support for Ukraine's army. Russia, which describes its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special military operation"" is barred this year.  One of the favourites for the Eurovision final, which has a huge global television audience, is Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra. Even though it operates out of the west of the country, which is less affected by the three-week conflict, band members have had to rehearse separately while they take on wartime duties.    Lead singer Oleh Psiuk is running a 20-strong volunteer group, supplying medicines and helping people flee the war. His girlfriend has been making Molotov cocktails, and another band member is serving in the territorial defence unit.  For Jamala, initially hesitant about performing while her country was under fire, doubts vanished when she started to sing: ""It seems to me that now this is what I can do. If I can sing and raise money to help Ukraine, I will continue to do it.""

Sri Lanka secures Indian lifeline as IMF signals help,2022-03-18 15:43:45+08:00,"COLOMBO: Cash-strapped Sri Lanka has secured a billion-dollar credit line from India to buy urgently needed food and medicine, officials said Friday (Mar 18), as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed it would discuss a possible bailout.  The South Asian nation is suffering its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948, with crippling shortages of essentials and fears it will default on its foreign debt or ask bondholders to take a ""haircut"" on repayments.  India and Sri Lanka formally entered into the credit agreement on Thursday during Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa's visit to New Delhi, Treasury Secretary Sajith Attygalle told reporters in Colombo.  ""India stands with Sri Lanka,"" Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said on Twitter. ""US$1 billion credit line signed for supply of essential commodities.""  The latest loan was on top of another US$500-million Indian credit line to help its island neighbour buy oil.  Meanwhile, the IMF on Friday confirmed it was considering President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's surprise Wednesday request to discuss a bailout.  ""We will discuss with the authorities how best we can assist Sri Lanka going forward,"" IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said in a statement to reporters in the capital.  Rajapaksa's announcement that he would go to the IMF - a U-turn from his previous position - increases the likelihood that Sri Lanka will seek to renegotiate some of its estimated US$51 billion in foreign debts.  Rice said the IMF had already highlighted the urgent need for Sri Lanka to implement a ""credible and coherent strategy to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability"".  Around US$6.9 billion of Colombo's debt needs to be serviced this year. Its foreign currency reserves stood at about US$2.3 billion at the end of February.  Sri Lanka earlier this year asked one of its main creditors, China, to help put off debt payments, but there has been no official response yet from Beijing. "
Hong Kong leader defends mainland medics against 'divisive comments',2022-03-18 16:47:15+08:00,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong's leader on Friday (Mar 18) warned against making ""divisive comments"" about mainland medics helping battle the city's deadly Omicron-fuelled wave after questions of accountability were raised by the press.  China this week sent about 400 healthcare workers to bolster the ranks of Hong Kong's anti-pandemic staff, a move that fuelled questions over the waiving of working licences for foreign doctors and medical accountability.  Local station Now TV drew the ire of Beijing supporters on Wednesday after its reporter asked how patients' complaints about mainland medics would be handled.  The channel issued an apology the next day after a pro-Beijing think tank called for the reporter to be fired and accused her of possibly breaching the city's sweeping national security law.  Imposed in 2020 by Beijing after massive and at-times violent democracy protests, the law criminalises dissent and has ensnared nearly 170 people - including journalists.  When pressed on the incident, leader Carrie Lam dismissed the idea the attacks on Now TV's reporter were a sign of waning press freedom.  ""Why do we want to make all this fuss and make divisive comments?"" Lam said at a Friday press conference. "

IRAS introduces new frameworks to help companies manage corporate tax and GST matters,2022-03-18 15:28:59+08:00,"SINGAPORE: The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has introduced two new tax frameworks to help companies manage corporate tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST) matters, it announced on Friday (Mar 18).   The Tax Governance Framework and the Tax Risk Management and Control Framework for Corporate Income Tax will help companies ""strengthen tax compliance"", said IRAS, adding that the two frameworks complement the existing GST Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme.   ""Together, they provide a suite of voluntary compliance tools that companies can adopt holistically or as independent programmes, depending on their readiness and business needs,"" said IRAS.   The Tax Governance Framework focuses on strengthening the tax governance standards and elevating them to the Board level.   It features a set of broad principles and practices around three main building blocks of good tax governance - compliance with tax laws, governance structure for managing tax risks, as well as relationship with tax authorities.   The framework is applicable to both Corporate Income Tax and GST. It can be adopted by any company willing to commit to good tax governance.   Meanwhile, the Tax Risk Management and Control Framework for Corporate Income Tax is targeted at large companies with ""complex structures and business models"", said IRAS.   This framework guides these companies in establishing ""robust"" internal controls and processes to identify, mitigate and monitor key corporate income tax risks.   It comprises a self-review checklist featuring processes and measures that would demonstrate that sound controls are in place to manage tax risks, such as the tax governance structure, entity level-controls and tax reporting controls.   Companies will get to enjoy benefits if they were awarded statuses under the two frameworks, said IRAS.  Under the Tax Governance Framework, companies that attain the TGF status can enjoy a longer grace period for voluntary disclosure of tax errors.   They can enjoy a one-time extended grace period of two years for voluntary disclosure of corporate income tax or withholding tax errors made, or both, within two years from the date of award of the status.  For GST-registered businesses accorded the Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme status, they can enjoy a one-time extended grace period of three years for voluntary disclosure of GST errors made within two years from the date of award of the TGF status.   For GST-registered businesses without ACAP status, they can enjoy a one-time extended grace period of two years for voluntary disclosure of GST errors made within two years from the award of the status.  As for eligible companies that attain the status under the framework for corporate income tax, they can enjoy a one-time waiver of penalties for voluntary disclosure of prior years' corporate income tax or withholding tax errors or both.   They can also enjoy a step-down on corporate income tax compliance audit for three consecutive Years of Assessment from the date the tax authority awards the status.   Commissioner of Inland Revenue Ng Wai Choong said IRAS ""strongly"" encourages companies to adopt all three frameworks to ensure ""proper"" internal controls and systems are in place to manage their tax risks.   ""By doing so, companies will give confidence to their stakeholders that they are effective in managing tax risks and transparent with their tax matters, as well as enjoy lower compliance costs in the long run,"" said Mr Ng.  More details on the eligibility criteria and the application process for the two frameworks can be found on the IRAS website. For enquiries, companies can contact the IRAS helpline at 1800 356 8622 or email ctmail [at] iras.gov.sg. "
Exclusive-Infra funds circle Vodafone for $16 billion Vantage Towers deal -sources,2022-03-18 19:28:01+08:00,"SINGAPORE/LONDON :Global infrastructure funds have approached Vodafone to invest in its $16 billion mast company Vantage Towers but the telecoms giant's preference is for an industry merger, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The bidders, which include investment firms Brookfield and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), have submitted unsolicited proposals in recent weeks valuing Vantage Towers at a premium to its current valuation of 15 billion euros ($16.57 billion), one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  The offers are for a majority stake in Vantage Towers, the source said, adding that Vodafone was studying the proposals and had not taken any decision.  Shares in Vantage Towers jumped 11.4per cent to a record 33.59 euros at 0926 GMT on the Reuters news and were up 10.4per cent at 11 GMT.  Vodafone shares were up 1.4per cent, outperforming their peers in the telecoms sector which was broadly flat.  Vodafone, which listed Vantage Towers in Frankfurt in March 2021 and still owns 81per cent of the business, has been reluctant to engage in talks with financial investors as it seeks to clinch an industry merger for Vantage with either Deutsche Telekom's towers unit DFMG or Orange's Totem, two separate sources said, cautioning no deal was imminent.  Vodafone, Orange and Brookfield declined to comment while GIP was not immediately available for comment.  A spokesperson for Deutsche Telekom said the company was reviewing strategic options for its infrastructure business, without elaborating.  Vodafone faces pressure from Europe's largest activist fund Cevian Capital to simplify its portfolio, enhance its strategy in key markets and boost returns.  If it goes ahead, a deal for its towers business would align Vodafone's strategy with Cevian's demands to look into strategic opportunities for its tower assets.  Such a move would come after the London-listed company turned down an 11 billion euro approach for its Italian operations in February, while its ambitions to consolidate the Spanish market hit a snag in early March after Orange and MasMovil announced exclusive talks to combine their respective businesses in Spain.  Telecoms executives have repeatedly called for market consolidation to reduce competition and boost operators' profitability at a time they need cash to invest in the rollout of 5G mobile telecom infrastructure.  ""LIKE-MINDED PLAYER""  Vodafone is now focusing on extracting value from its controlling stake in Vantage Towers, with boss Nick Read repeatedly mentioning Orange's Totem or Deutsche Telekom's tower assets as suitable candidates.  ""The next stage (for Vantage) should be an industrial merger, bringing our towers with another large player, a like-minded player, a like-minded operator,"" Read told reporters last month, stressing his interest in exploring a combination with the infrastructure assets of either Orange or Deutsche Telekom.  He added that while Vodafone was open to cutting its stake in Vantage, there was ""plenty of room for us to monetize down while staying in co-control of that entity with that like-minded player.""  Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Deutsche Telekom had kicked off an auction for its towers business with indicative bids expected in mid March.  One of the sources said that while Vodafone is closely monitoring Deutsche Telekom's towers sale, it is more likely to pursue a deal with Orange's Totem due to antitrust concerns in Germany.  This source ruled out a deal with financial investors, saying that at this stage only an industry tie-up was on the cards.  Burdened by heavy debt and huge costs, telecom towers have been the target of several big takeovers in the past few years.  Independent tower operators such as Spain's Cellnex and U.S.-based American Tower Corp are also on the lookout for infrastructure deals as they race to expand in Europe for the roll-out of next-generation 5G technology.

"It’s confirmed: Singaporean actors Desmond Tan, Rebecca Lim joining Hong Kong zombie film",2022-03-18 15:19:44+08:00,"It’s confirmed: Local actors Desmond Tan and Rebecca Lim will be joining a star-studded Asian cast in the new Hong Kong zombie film, Chungking Mansions. They were first reported to be in talks for the roles in September last year.   The 35-year-old Tan is especially excited to join the cast as he’s a big zombie fan and has been since he was a kid.   “I was obsessed with the Hong Kong zombie shows as a kid. I remember imitating zombies and hopping around my home with my face powdered with baby powder when I was a preschooler,” he told CNA Lifestyle.   “The craze of zombie shows is back in recent years and it has always been in my bucket list to act in one. I think it will be a dream come true to participate in a zombie show, finally,” he added.   Although his co-star, Lim, is not quite a fan of the genre, she admitted to CNA Lifestyle that she’s looking forward to acting in the film as it’s a genre she hasn’t done before.   “I’ve never been a fan of the horror-thriller genre because I really don’t enjoy being scared,” said the 35-year-old actress. “I always watch them with my eyes half closed and ears covered! But strangely, I’m excited to be a part of a horror film or a zombie film because it’s not as easy creating the moments to instil suspense, fear, nervousness and relief. I’ve never acted in this genre before so I’m really looking forward!”  Tan also shared that he’s a fan of Wong Kar Wai's Chungking Express so he’s looking forward to shooting a movie in the iconic Chungking Mansions.  The actor said he doesn’t have a lot of details at the moment about how long he’ll be in Hong Kong. However, when CNA Lifestyle asked who he would miss the most when he's away – his wife or his dog – he had a firm answer.   “Trick question? I will miss all! Hahaha!” he replied.   Another newly confirmed cast member is Hong Kong pop sensation, Anson Lo, from idol group Mirror, who has officially joined the cast.  Rounding up the previously announced cast are Japanese action star Rina Takeda, Hong Kong-Canadian actresses Selena Lee and Jeannie Chan, Korean star Choi Si-hun, Hong Kong actor Louis Cheung and Thai actress Davika Hoorne.  Directed and produced by Bizhan Tong, this zombie action-thriller follows a diverse group of people from all around the world as they try to break into Chungking Mansions, following a devastating zombie outbreak in Hong Kong.   According to an earlier report in Deadline, Lim will be playing the right-hand woman of the person responsible for the zombie outbreak, while Tan will play a hustler who helps the lead character navigate the mansions to save his family.   The film will mainly be in English, but it will also feature a number of languages such as Japanese, Cantonese and Korean.   “Chungking Mansions contributes to the evolving tapestry of zombie lore while paying tribute to the socially charged narratives of George A Romero, bringing it closer in tone to Jordan Peele’s Get Out and Us,” Tong told Deadline.

Get a health check before embarking on your family planning journey,2022-03-18 15:08:47+08:00,"Singapore’s fertility rate saw a drop to a historic low of 1.1 in 2020 – a trend mirrored in many developed societies, as couples marry and form families later in life.   According to Dr Andrew Kan, a fertility specialist at Virtus Fertility Centre, there are several main causes of infertility in Singapore that are also commonly found in other developed countries like Australia and the United Kingdom. These include ovulation factor infertility, tubal factor infertility, uterine factor infertility and male factor infertility.  “Five to 10 per cent of infertility cases have unexplained causes,” he added. “But being unable to identify a cause for infertility does not necessarily mean that the couple has no problem.”   While some may assume that artificial reproductive technology (ART) such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) can help couples – including older ones – have a baby, many might not realise that IVF and other tools are not always successful.   For couples who intend to have children, it’s best to start thinking early about family planning and to undergo a fertility health check at the very start of their journey, so that any possible fertility issues can be uncovered and addressed. While a successful conception, pregnancy and delivery take around nine months, the journey to having a baby starts far earlier than that.   CONSULTATION CUSTOMISED TO YOUR NEEDS  Virtus Fertility Centre is part of Virtus Health, the largest ART healthcare provider in Australia and has been helping couples in Singapore with fertility treatment for over six years since it opened here.   Dr Liow Swee Lian, the scientific director of Virtus Fertility Centre, said that its large network of international and local fertility experts will ensure that couples enjoy an individualised approach to their treatment.  “There will also be continuity of care if the couple relocates to another country where Virtus Health IVF clinics are available, whether due to job placement or for further treatment not available in their country of origin,” he added.  At Virtus Fertility Centre, couples are handheld through every stage of the journey and process of IVF treatment, from medication to monitoring, egg collection and embryo transfer.   This patient-centric approach is intended to clarify misconceptions and alleviate anxiety, said Dr Liow. “Couples who have decided to seek IVF treatment are often anxious about their fertility issues. A majority would have sought information on fertility issues from social media and the Internet, which may cause confusion and exacerbate their anxiety.”   To better support couples, Virtus Fertility Centre offers a private counselling service delivered by a team of fertility coaches for all IVF patients prior to hormone stimulation and just before embryo transfer. This pre-IVF counselling covers information on finance and consent, a discussion with a clinical embryologist as well as emotional support.   There is also a specialised counselling option for those undergoing donor programmes and genetic testing.  “Entering an IVF cycle in the right mental and emotional state is important, and does ultimately affect the chance of the couple’s success at the end of treatment,” said Dr Kan, who pointed out that many couples decide after one or two unsuccessful IVF cycles to stop trying due to the mental and emotional strain.  Citing studies of large registry IVF statistics across the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, Dr Kan said: “Even up to six cycles, there is still a respectable pregnancy rate. Thus, here in Virtus Fertility Centre, we place an extraordinary emphasis on the mental and emotional health of the couple, with our dedicated fertility counsellors.”   INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO AID CONCEPTION  In addition to taking a holistic approach to fertility, Virtus Fertility Centre also deploys innovative technology to ensure the best chances of a successful outcome.   This includes embryo selection aided by artificial intelligence (AI) to optimise the odds of successful conception, as well as the use of electronic ID tagging to digitally track every egg, sperm and embryo within the Virtus Fertility Centre laboratory. By tagging every container and vessel with a radio frequency ID tag, Virtus Fertility Centre ensures that the risk of human error is minimised and samples are correctly linked to each patient.   Dr Liow explained that embryo selection is commonly done by an embryologist who assesses the morphological integrity of the cells within an embryo at a specific point in time. The process can be subjective, with different embryologists issuing different grades to the same embryo. Using technology like a time-lapse incubator enables more precise embryo grading, as video recordings of the embryos throughout development can be reviewed and scored.   “The process of reviewing and scoring embryos increases the already heavy workload in the IVF laboratory,” he explained. “The incorporation of AI in the time-lapse incubator has hastened and improved the process of embryo selection and pregnancy outcome.”   With all the advances of technology, starting early on the family planning journey is still the most important step that a couple can take.   Said Dr Kan: “It is important for couples who want a child to go for a fertility health check as early as possible – even before you actually start trying, because it enables both early diagnosis and treatment if needed. Early detection means lots of options are available and treatment is much easier. A good example is the Anti-Mullerian Hormone blood tests, which checks a woman’s ovarian reserve or the number of eggs that she has. If this is known early, couples can consider treatment options like starting a family earlier than planned, undergoing fertility treatments such as IVF, or embryo freezing if they are not ready to start a family right there and then.”   Equip yourself for your family planning journey with Virtus Fertility Centre.
