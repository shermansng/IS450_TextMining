Ukraine war: UK households offered Â£350 a month for hosting refugees,2022-03-13T20:11:56.000Z,"Households in the UK will be offered Â£350 a month to open their homes to people fleeing the war in Ukraine. Housing Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC tens of thousands of people could come to the UK under the scheme and he may offer a room to a refugee. But the Refugee Council is concerned about the level of support for those traumatised by war. Labour said there were unanswered questions, accusing the government of ""dragging its feet"" over the crisis. Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, people will be able to nominate a named individual or a family to stay with them rent-free, or in another property, for at least six months. A website to express an interest in being a sponsor will launch on Monday. Mr Gove also told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme the government was looking at using the properties of Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the UK for ""humanitarian purposes"" but there was ""quite a high legal bar"" and this measure would lapse as sanctions ended. Retailers Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer and Morrisons are among the UK companies offering to employ Ukrainian refugees.  Asos said it wanted to attract Ukraine's strong technology engineering skill set, while soap shop Lush said it would open up internal vacancies to refugees. Addressing a rally outside Downing Street on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, called for more support, weapons and humanitarian assistance. LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbySANCTIONS: Impact on everyday lives in RussiaEXIT: Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroadRECRUITS: Ukraine's teenage soldiersIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict Local authorities will also receive Â£10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said. More than 2.5 million people have so far fled Ukraine because of Russia's invasion, in what the UN has called the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War Two. The government has faced criticism - including from its own MPs - over the speed and scale of its response. Defending the government's response, Mr Gove told the BBC the number of Ukrainians fleeing the war who had been granted visas had now risen to 3,000.  At the moment, only those fleeing the conflict who have family connections in the UK are able to make an application via the Ukraine Family Scheme. Other visas are available but application centres in Ukraine are closed. Under the new scheme sponsors in the UK will not be required to know the refugees in advance and there will be no limit on numbers. Ukrainians on the scheme will be given leave to remain for three years, with the right to work and access public services. Mr Gove told the BBC that he anticipated ""tens of thousands"" of Ukrainians might be taken in by UK families with the first arrivals ""within a week"". Applications will be made online, with both sponsors being vetted and refugees having to go through security checks. The sponsor will get a ""thank you"" payment of Â£350 a month. Asked if he would take a Ukrainian refugee into his home, Mr Gove said ""yes"" and that he was ""exploring what I can do"". ""Without going into my personal circumstances, there are a couple of things I need to sort out - but yes,"" he added. In a later phase of the scheme, organisations such as charities andÂ churches will also be able to sponsor refugees, though there is no start date for this yet. Two weeks since it was announced, we now have some details of the scheme allowing people to host refugees in their homes.  The idea is a simple one, but the practicalities of matching those fleeing Russia's invasion with willing households in the UK won't be easy.  Aiming to place people with hosts within a fortnight is ambitious and the system is untested.  Ministers are keen to avoid using hotels or other temporary accommodation used by Afghans last year, and are adamant that security checks should stay in place on those fleeing Ukraine. But for some Conservative MPs, let alone Labour and other opposition parties, the government's response has fallen short.  And it's no accident that Michael Gove - and not the Home Secretary Priti Patel - is fronting the latest efforts to smooth out and speed up the process of settling people in the UK.  What ministers have described as a cross-government approach has looked at times like inter-departmental wrangling over who's best placed to get things done.  The Refugee Council - a charity supporting refugees and asylum seekers in the UK - said it was concerned people from Ukraine were facing further ""bureaucratic hurdles"", and the government scheme fell short of what was needed. Claiming formal refugee status, or permission to stay for humanitarian reasons through the asylum system, does not require a visa and allows an applicant and their dependants to stay in the UK for five years, with the right to work, study and apply for benefits. For the third time in a year, John Rutherford and his wife Sue are considering opening up their south London house to a refugee. ""We have a big house, my kids have left home,"" says John. ""It's not a great hardship for us to make some space for a refugee."" In 2021, they hosted one person from Ethiopia and one from Iran, each for a couple of weeks while they awaited longer-term accommodation during the asylum application process. And now, he is ready to open his five-bedroom house again. ""It was the sheer numbers involved that made me want to help... there could be four or five million people looking for places to stay, so the UK has to do its bit and the British people have to do their bit."" Read more Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News the government's visa schemes have been ""too slow, too narrow, too mean"", adding that the government had not consulted local councils about the support that needs to be put in place. ""Frankly the last few weeks have been an embarrassment to the United Kingdom in terms of refugees,"" he said. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said Home Secretary Priti Patel should be sacked for the government's response to Ukrainian refugees. ""The incompetence, indifference and sheer inhumanity we have seen from the home secretary does not befit our United Kingdom, with its proud history of providing sanctuary to those in need,"" he told the party's spring conference in York. A government spokesperson responded to Sir Ed's comments by saying ""the facts do not support these accusations"", and repeating a claim that the UK had ""resettled more refugees through safe and legal routes than any other European country"" since 2015. As BBC Reality Check reported this week, while this specific claim is true, the overall picture is very different - as some other European countries have taken in far more refugees than the UK since 2015. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have written to the UK government to propose that their nations go further with the new scheme. The European Union is allowing Ukrainians three-year residency without a visa, but the UK says controls on entry are essential for security.  Ireland takes in 5,500 Ukrainian refugeesWales ready to welcome 1,000 Ukrainian refugees The Republic of Ireland's prime minister Micheal Martin told the BBC's Sunday Morning show that his country had taken in 5,500 Ukrainian refugees but had not carried out any security checks on entry. Meanwhile, celebrities including actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Graham have shown their support for Ukraine at the Bafta Awards 2022, under way in central London.

War in Ukraine: Uni to uniform - Ukraine's new teenage army recruits,2022-03-12T23:57:22.000Z,"Just over a week ago I met a group of young men who had volunteered at a centre in Kyiv to fight for Ukraine.  Most of them were in their late teens, not long out of school. They told me that after three days' basic training they would head for the front line - or very close to it.  Maksym Lutsyk, a 19-year-old biology student, told me he wasn't fazed about trying to become a soldier after less than a week of instruction. He'd manage, after five years in the Scouts, not just learning backwoods skills, but also some weapons training. He was 10 when Ukraine's long war with separatists sponsored by Moscow started in 2014. Maksym had gone to join up with his friend Dmytro Kisilenko, 18, who was studying economics at the same university.  The recruits were like any bunch of young lads who had decided they were no longer boys, laughing too loudly when someone told jokes to hide their nerves, or trying a bit of bravado.  Some of them were wearing knee pads that looked too small, as if they had come with skateboards on their 12th birthdays. A few had sleeping bags. One had a yoga mat. When they waited outside for the bus that was going to be taking them to the training base, they looked like friends on the way to a festival - apart from the guns. Each had been given custody of a Kalashnikov assault rifle. I'm in touch with Dmytro and Maksym and the other volunteers. This weekend I went to see them at their posts on the eastern edge of the city, where they have been issued with uniforms, body armour, proper infantry kneepads and helmets.  A bitter wind blew through the checkpoint which the volunteers were trying to turn into a real obstacle with sandbags and steel tank traps. They made the best of their very basic training. Dmytro told me: ""I got used to my gun. I learned how to shoot and how to act in the battle, also many other things that will be very crucial in the fight with the Russians."" He laughed, as if he found it hard to imagine what he was contemplating. Maksym looked more urgent, more serious, less like a laid-back student.    ""I feel much more confident than I was before, because we get enough knowledge in tactics, in martial arts, in tactical medicine and in how to do something on the battlefield."" Only half joking, he wanted to see the Ukrainian flag flying from the Kremlin.  The question on everyone's mind here is whether the battle is coming for Kyiv. ""It's definitely possible"" said Dmytro. ""We just have to stop them here, because if they get to Kyiv this war might be over."" They are from the same town near the Russian border, which is being shelled. Their families are still there. I asked the boys what their parents thought of what they were doing. Maksym joked that his mother had told him to stay in a shelter and volunteer to cook the food. He had spared them the details of his deployment because he didn't want to worry them. Dmytro's parents knew what he was doing. He had started by volunteering to make Molotov cocktails and after a few days rang his dad to tell him he had decided to join the territorial defence force. His father told him not to try too hard to be a hero.  My parents, Dmytro said, are proud of what I'm doing. He looked delighted. I asked him if he felt scared of what is ahead. ""Not much, but it is human nature to feel scared, and of course deeply in my soul I feel a bit scared, as no one wants to die, even if it's for your country. So, death is not an option for us.""  Dmytro and Maksym talked about their dreams for the future, fun with friends, finishing their studies, careers and eventually families. Their parents must be praying that their sons' plans, energy and even their lives are not smashed by the brutal realities of war, like so many in all the other generations of young men who have joined up to fight in Europe's wars.  LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbySANCTIONS: Impact on everyday lives in RussiaEXIT: Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroadIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict Foreign journalists have no access to the young Russian men only a few miles away on the other side of the front line. Many are believed to be conscripts, who were not told properly what was being planned for them. Wars are mostly fought by young men.  I have no doubt that many young Russians in the war have hopes as high as Dmytro and Maksym. One difference might be less motivation to fight, though without the chance to report their side properly, it is hard to say with certainty.   The two young Ukrainian students-turned-soldiers went back to work on the checkpoint. The professional army is a couple of miles ahead, directly facing the Russians.  But if the Russians come, like all the volunteers, Maksym and Dmytro will be firing out of the trenches they helped dig into the surrounding ground, where boxes of Molotov cocktails are waiting - old bottles filled with petrol and pieces of grated polystyrene and stuffed with a rag to ignite what they hope might even disable a tank.  If that doesn't work, the Nato military alliance is pouring in thousands of much more sophisticated anti-tank weapons.     Everyone here in Kyiv is waiting for what is likely to be the key battle of the war, soldiers, civilians in and out of uniform, along with Maksym and Dmytro and the other volunteers who are getting ready to fight with them."
Scotland and Wales bid to be refugee super sponsors,2022-03-13T11:12:16.000Z,"Scotland's first minister and her Welsh counterpart have proposed that both governments become ""super sponsors"" to Ukranian refugees fleeing the war. Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford have written to the UK government to confirm their commitment in contributing to its community sponsorship scheme. But Scotland and Wales have offered to step further to support refugees by acting as super sponsors. It is hoped this would allow Ukrainians to come to the two countries faster. The idea would be to get them into temporary accommodation immediately and then work with local partners to provide longer-term places to stay, including with host individuals, and give them access to safeguarding and services.  Households in the UK will be offered Â£350 a month to open their homes to people fleeing the war in Ukraine. The UK government's Homes for Ukraine scheme calls on people to offer a spare room or an empty property to a refugee for a period of at least six months. In a joint letter to Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford have emphasised that the government must provide more clarity on how the scheme will work.  The letter makes clear that no cap will be set by Scotland and Wales on the numbers of refugees they will welcome.  Scotland has made an immediate commitment to support 3,000 refugees in the initial wave, in line with the numbers that were resettled under the Syrian scheme. Wales would take 1,000. The Scottish government said it would welcome ""at least"" a proportionate share of the total number who come to the UK. The letter also says it is essential that all arrivals have access to public funds, including welfare benefits, and are exempted from the Habitual Residence Test for accessing these. The first ministers also call for urgent clarity on funding arrangements to support local government and they have suggested a ""per head"" funding arrangement similar to the Syrian and Afghanistan schemes to support resettlement and integration costs.  Finally, the letter calls for all visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals to be waived. Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I want Scotland to play our full part in welcoming Ukrainians seeking sanctuary from war. The UK response so far has been beset with bureaucracy and red tape, when what is needed is humanity and urgent refuge for as many as possible.  ""We are still awaiting full details of the proposed community sponsorship scheme. If the UK government is still unwilling to waive visa requirements, it is essential that this scheme works efficiently and effectively and allows people to come to the UK as quickly as possible.  ""However, I am very worried that if people have to be matched with an individual sponsor before even being allowed entry to the UK, it will prove slow and cumbersome."" She said that super sponsorship would allow large numbers to come to the respective nations quickly and that she would be able to welcome Ukrainians to Scotland as soon as possible. However, refugee support groups fear the main problem is not with hosting Ukrainians, but in visa restrictions stopping them from entering the country in the first place. Robina Qureshi, director of refugee homelessness charity Positive Action in Housing, said there were skilled and experienced hosting networks up and down the country with thousands of hosts.  ""Britain is not planning on taking its fair share of refugees, even though there is public support for taking in Ukrainian refugees,"" she said.  ""The families who host refugees don't do it for money, they are helping because they see a government that is heartless and won't lift visa restrictions.  ""The number of houses is not the problem and this is a gimmick - just another distraction from the fact that the UK is still the only country in Europe that hasn't lifted visa restrictions and there are still no safe routes here for Ukrainian war refugees."" A spokesman for the Department for Levelling Up said: ""We are always grateful to the devolved govts for their offers of support.  ""We will continue to work with the devolved governments in the organisation of this scheme and see how best it can continue to be delivered.""

Irbil attack: Iran launches missiles at northern Iraqi city,2022-03-13T14:59:14.000Z,"Iran's Revolutionary Guards force says it targeted an Israeli ""strategic centre"" with missiles that struck the Iraqi Kurdish city of Irbil overnight. Twelve missiles hit areas around the US consulate overnight, causing material damage and wounding one civilian, the Kurdistan Regional Government said. The US said no Americans were hurt and that its facilities were not damaged in what it called the ""outrageous attack"". Israel's military and government declined to comment on Iran's claim. But Kurdish officials accused the Revolutionary Guards of seeking to use ""baseless"" propaganda to justify targeting civilian locations. Taxi driver Ziryan Wazir said he was in his car near the US consulate when the missiles struck at around 01:00 on Sunday (23:00 GMT on Saturday). ""I saw a lot of dust, then I heard a very loud noise. The windows of my car exploded and I was injured in the face,"" he told AFP news agency. A local television channel, Kurdistan24, posted images of damage to its offices caused by the blasts.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Iranian state media cited a Revolutionary Guards statement as saying the force had targeted ""the Zionists' strategic centre of plotting and evil"" in Irbil with precision-guided missiles in response to ""recent crimes"".  The Revolutionary Guards had vowed to make Israel ""pay"" for an air strike near the Syrian capital Damascus on Monday that killed two senior Iranian officers. The Kurdistan Region's Council of Ministers said: ""This cowardly attack on Irbil... allegedly under the pretext of hitting an Israeli base near the US Consulate in Irbil, targeted civilian locations and its justification is only to hide the disgracefulness of such offence."" ""We reiterate that the propaganda of the perpetrators of this attack is far from true."" Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Kadhimi also condemned the attack. ""The aggression which targeted the dear city of Irbil and spread fear amongst its inhabitants is an attack on the security of our people,"" he tweeted.  ""Our security forces will investigate and stand firm against any threats towards our people."" The US ambassador to Iraq, Matthew Tueller, said that Iran ""must be held accountable for this flagrant violation of Iraqi sovereignty and for terrorist attacks on innocent civilian properties""."
Bafta Film Awards: Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog wins top prize,2022-03-13T21:04:30.000Z,"Netflix's moody Western The Power of the Dog won the top prize at the Bafta Film Awards, picking up best film and best director for Jane Campion. Its star Benedict Cumberbatch wore a badge to show his support for Ukrainians as he accepted the best director prize on behalf of Campion. He also said he hopes to offer a place to stay for a Ukrainian refugee. Cumberbatch was beaten to the best actor award by Will Smith. Joanna Scanlan was named best actress. Scanlan, who was previously best known for British TV comedies like The Thick Of It and Getting On, triumphed for her performance in the independent film After Love. She played a 60-year-old Muslim convert who suffers an identity crisis following the sudden death of her husband. ""Come on!"" she said on stage in disbelief. ""Some stories have surprise endings don't they?"" She beat a field including Lady Gaga, fellow musician-turned-actress Alana Haim, and Emilia Jones, the daughter of Welsh TV presenter Aled. Jones starred in Coda, a film about the daughter of deaf parents, and her co-star Troy Kotsur made history as the first ever deaf Bafta film winner. Delivering his best supporting actor acceptance speech via an interpreter, he said: ""I think it's all great you're recognising my work from all the way across the sea, it's truly amazing."" Another US performer, Ariana DeBose, won best supporting actress for playing Anita in Steven Spielberg's new version of the musical West Side Story. ""This means so much to me, I'm somebody who sings, dances, acts,"" she said. ""I speak dance better than I speak English."" 7 Bafta highlights - from the jokes to the dressesSee the list of winners and nomineesBafta red carpet in pictures Sir Kenneth Branagh's Belfast was named outstanding British film, while sci-fi saga Dune won five awards in total - best score for Hans Zimmer plus best cinematography, production design, sound and special visual effects. James Bond's latest outing No Time To Die won two prizes including the EE Rising Star award for Lashana Lynch. ""I would like to thank the women of this country who taught me what it is to be in this industry as a dark-skinned woman,"" she told the ceremony. ""I thank you for laying the foundation for people like me."" The ceremony was held at the Royal Albert Hall and was hosted by Australian comic actress Rebel Wilson, who largely kept the atmosphere light but did refer to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on a couple of occasions. After the In Memoriam section, paying tribute to film industry figures who have died over the past 12 months, she said: ""Our thoughts are also at this time with the people afflicted by the conflict in Ukraine."" And in a segment about sign language, she raised her middle finger, saying it was ""the gesture for Putin"". The war was a topic of conversation on the red carpet earlier, when Cumberbatch said he was aware badges like his ""could be dismissed as tokenism"". ""This [ceremony] is a celebration of an industry that's about imagery, and images speaking as loud as if not louder sometimes than words. So it's a small gesture,"" he told BBC News. ""But away from this, what we all have to do is continue to put pressure on our politicians as far as the refugee crisis goes, continue to put pressure on the Putin regime, continue to help in any which way we can - whether that's through donations or housing refugees, all of which I'm looking to do and have done."" Fellow best actor nominee Stephen Graham, who was wearing a blue and yellow bow, said it was ""vital"" to acknowledge the war at the event. ""I want to show my support and solidarity for what people are going through,"" he said. Bafta chairman Krishnendu Majumdar told the audience before the ceremony: ""We are hugely grateful to the journalists and film-makers covering Ukraine, many of whom are Bafta members, who are bravely reporting and documenting the conflict and humanitarian crisis."" Dame Shirley Bassey then opened the event with a performance of her classic James Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever. Big names returned to the Royal Albert Hall after a subdued affair last year, when many nominees appeared via Zoom amid tight Covid-19 restrictions. No Bafta Fellowship or other lifetime achievement award was presented on Sunday, after last year's recipient Noel Clarke was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment following his win.  Clarke said he was ""deeply sorry"" for some of his actions but ""vehemently"" denied sexual misconduct."
Boss accused of defrauding blind workers' pensions,2022-03-13T00:27:27.000Z,"The Pensions Regulator is investigating whether the owner of one of the UK's oldest social enterprises fraudulently failed to make disabled workers' pension contributions. The 168-year-old soap maker Clarity was bought from administration in 2020.  Workers say they lost their jobs and are still owed redundancy payments, furlough money and wages. The owner, Nicholas Marks said he looked forward to ""clarifying the position"" with the Regulator. Olgun ""Ozzie"" Ibrahim caught Covid a week before Christmas 2020. By the time he recovered, he was told not to come back to work. He was put on furlough in January, and received two months furlough money but nothing more - no pension payments, and no notice period or redundancy when he finally lost his job in July. Registered blind, he had worked for 29 years at Clarity & Co, a social enterprise which had been providing employment opportunities for blind and disabled people since 1854, making toiletries under the Clarity, the Soap Co. and Beco brands. The business, whose patrons ranged from Queen Victoria to Joanna Lumley, was losing money, and it was put into administration in January 2020. On the same day the business and its assets were bought by a businessman, Nicholas Marks, who now stands accused of not paying workers' wages and pensions. Clarity had around 80 workers when it was sold, of whom 65 were blind, disabled, or had a health condition.  It was more than a job, says Mr Ibrahim, it was like a family too. Since leaving, he and his fellow workers have struggled to find work. âNo-one wants to employ disabled, blind people,â he says. âThough we can do the work, no-one wants to take the chance.â The BBC has also spoken to a number of former Clarity employees who say pension contributions were deducted from their pay packets but were never paid to the pension provider, Scottish Widows. Among them is former team leader Allan Brooks, who worked at the company for 17 years. Registered blind, he says he didn't receive furlough money or redundancy either.  When he heard he was losing his job, âit was a massive shock,â he says. âI was expecting to see my working days out at the company.â He is now taking medication for depression, and hasnât worked since he left. A number of his former colleagues are also suffering from mental health issues, Mr Ibrahim says. The BBC has learned that The Pensions Regulator has begun an investigation into Nicholas Marks for alleged fraudulent evasion of the duty to pass on pension contributions to a workplace pension scheme, under the 1995 Pensions Act. The Pensions Regulator would not confirm or deny the investigation. The UK Employment Tribunal website also lists judgements in favour of over 40 individuals who have won claims for unauthorised deduction of wages and other monies owed to workers by Clarity Products (the company's new name under Mr Marks's ownership). The BBC has spoken to seven of them, who say they have not been paid the money the tribunal awarded. Clarity Products - renamed Jublee Number 7 Ltd - is now being liquidated. Documents from the insolvency practitioners Quantuma, seen by the BBC, show the company owed more than Â£435,626 to 84 employees, including Mr Ibrahim and Mr Brooks. Scottish Widows is owed Â£37,068 and NEST Pensions Â£15,494. The company's total debts amounted to more than Â£1.3m.  Local MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith wrote to the minister responsible, Jesse Norman, in November 2020 to highlight the case but HMRC cannot confirm or deny whether it has begun an investigation. HMRC is owed Â£231,839 by Jublee Number 7, the insolvency documents show. In a statement, Mr Marks told the BBC: ""I understand that there are some technical questions being asked by the Regulator as to the supply of certain documents. Whilst I was not involved with the detail of these, much if not all of this is attributable to the pandemic which left our offices being unmanned, correspondence going astray and the departure of staff whose responsibility it was to provide this information."" He also said he has personally lost around Â£500,000 and so ""any suggestion that I took money out is both absurd and patently untrue."" He said that ""During that chaotic period [following the sale, and during the pandemic] some people weren't paid. I'm sorry that happened but some workers were TUPE'd [transferred] over from offices that no longer existed and didn't have any roles. That's not an excuse but I'm trying to explain how we inherited a complete mess."" ""For me, my biggest regret is that I couldn't save the business and the jobs but unforeseeable events conspired to make it an impossible task,"" the statement continued.  Mr Marks did not comment on whether he would repay any of the workers who are still owed money.  Little is known about Nicholas Marks. Born in 1967, he describes himself as British on Companies House, though he also has links with South Africa. In 2019, he bought a company in Lancashire called Lunar Caravans out of administration. Workers there have also complained about unpaid furlough money.  Nicholas Marks was banned from acting as a director of a company for a year from 3 August 2020 for infringements at another company, Stafferton Waste, which has since been dissolved. He was subject to bankruptcy orders in 2007 and 2017, according to official notices published in the London Gazette. Following reports on BBC News and elsewhere about the plight of former Clarity workers, Nicholas Marks sued two people for spreading what he claimed was false information about the company.  They were Camilla Marcus-Dew, Clarityâs former Head of Commercial, and Cemal Ezel, a social entrepreneur who made an unsuccessful bid to buy Clarity out of administration in 2020. The pair - who deny Mr Marksâs allegations - initially had to represent themselves without legal advice. They are now represented on a pro bono basis by two law firms, Quinn Emanuel for Ms Marcus-Dew and Hausfeld for Mr Ezel.  Separately, on 27 January Ms Marcus-Dew was awarded Â£38,491 by an employment tribunal for constructive dismissal from Clarity, on top of Â£11,000 awarded earlier for unpaid wages (she has received nothing, she says). Mr Ezel said that the ongoing litigation had forced him to scale back plans to expand his social enterprise, Change Please, a coffee business which provides opportunities and training for homeless people.  Social Enterprise UK has launched a crowdfunding campaign to support former workers and campaign for policy changes to prevent similar situations occurring in the future.  Nest Pensions, Scottish Widows and Quantuma all declined to comment."
Roman Abramovich: Rabbi investigated over Portuguese citizenship,2022-03-12T23:39:14.000Z,"A rabbi who helped Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich obtain his Portuguese citizenship has been told he cannot leave Portugal and must present himself to authorities when required. Daniel Litvak was detained on Thursday as part of an investigation into how citizenship had been granted.  The naturalisation process of several Jewish people is being investigated. On Friday, Mr Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Abramovich, 55, is the owner of Chelsea FC and he is one of seven oligarchs to be hit with fresh sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans. The Premier League has disqualified him as a director of the club. Mr Abramovich was granted Portuguese citizenship in April 2021 under a law that offered naturalisation to descendants of Sephardic Jews, who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula more than 400 years ago during the Inquisition. Applicants for Portuguese citizenship via this route are assessed by experts at one of Portugal's Jewish communities in either Lisbon or Porto. Mr Litvak is the rabbi for the community in Porto (northern Portugal) and was responsible for assessing Mr Abramovich's application.  Mr Litvak was detained by authorities as he was preparing to travel to Israel. He was asked to hand over his passport and will have to periodically present himself to authorities.  Portugal's Judicial Police and public prosecutor said on Friday that there were suspicions of money laundering, corruption, fraud and falsification of documents in the process of of granting citizenship to descendants of Sephardic Jews. Porto's Jewish community has denied any wrongdoing and said it was the target of a smear campaign. They added that Mr Litvak oversaw the department that grants certification of an individual's Sephardic Jewish heritage and the criteria used for granting someone Portuguese nationality had ""been accepted by successive governments"".

Sarah Everard: Protesters demand 'radical change' to Met Police,2022-03-12T19:45:48.000Z,"Protesters demanding ""radical change"" to the Metropolitan Police have marched through central London. Activists held traffic outside New Scotland Yard before marching to Charing Cross Police Station. They carried banners reading ""police are perpetrators"", set off bright blue smoke flares and said they activated 1,000 rape alarms. The protest marks a year since an unofficial gathering to pay respects to Sarah Everard saw clashes with police. It also comes a day after judges ruled police breached the rights of the organisers of a planned vigil for Sarah Everard. Ms Everard was murdered by a serving Met officer, Wayne Couzens. The Met has previously said it is trying to rebuild trust with the public after several misconduct cases involving its officers. About 300 demonstrators from various groups chanted ""racist police, sexist police"" while walking towards Trafalgar Square and Charing Cross Police Station.  Patsy Stevenson, who was arrested at a vigil for Sarah Everard in the days following her murder last year, said ""radical change from the whole of the policing system"" was needed. Gina Cane of Sisters Uncut, a feminist activist group who organised the protest, said: ""We reject the authority of the police, a racist misogynist institution built on coercion and control.""  Protesters also said they opposed the Police, Crime and Sentencing Bill which, if passed, would give police greater powers to control protests. Ms Everard was kidnapped in south London on 3 March 2021 as she was walking home from a friend's house. Her attacker was sentenced to a whole-life term after pleading guilty to murder.  A spontaneous vigil in Clapham Common, south London, led to the Met being heavily criticised for its actions - although it went on to be cleared by the police watchdog. A previously organised vigil was cancelled after organisers were told it would be illegal to stage it under lockdown conditions.  In February, an Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) report discovered misogyny, discrimination, bullying and sexual harassment within the ranks of the force.  Addressing the IOPC report, the Met said in a statement it acknowledged the damage in trust their behaviour had caused.  It added it would take ""urgent action"" to improve.  Baroness Louise Casey is carrying out an independent review of culture and standards within the Met. It will examine the force's vetting, recruitment and training procedures."

"Ukraine: Ireland's 'priority is humanitarian' as it takes 5,500 refugees",2022-03-13T14:47:22.000Z,"Five-and-a-half-thousand Ukrainian refugees have now arrived in the Republic of Ireland, the country's taoiseach (prime minister) has said. Ireland lifted restrictions on Ukrainians arriving in the country shortly after Russia invaded. This allows them to enter Ireland without checks or visas beforehand, as well as access benefits and healthcare, and the right to work. MicheÃ¡l Martin said a humanitarian response ""trumps anything"". More than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded, in what the UN has called the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War Two. The Irish government has previously said it could take up to 100,000 refugees.  LIVE: Latest updates from on the ground Asked about the figure by Sophie Raworth on BBC's Sunday Morning, Mr Martin said Ireland had ""never experienced anything on this scale before, but we believe we need to do it"". He added: ""Our primary impulse is to assist those fleeing war. ""The Irish people are very seized by a series of atrocities that are going on, what we're witnessing on our screens every evening is really shocking people and there is huge human empathy there to help the women and the children. ""There is always a balancing of issues, we keep channels open with our UK counterparts. The Home Secretary and our Minister for Justice Helen McEntee have been in regular contact."" Mr Martin is in London on a two-day trip, where he has discussed  the Northern Ireland protocol with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as well as the international response to Ukraine. When asked about security concerns Mr Martin said: ""The humanitarian response trumps anything as far as we're concerned. ""But our security people will keep on monitoring the situation in terms of what's on. ""We can all see the humanitarian crisis, we do know that that can be exploited by certain bad actors, but our security personnel will keep an eye on that in a more general way. ""The prime minister's only discussion with me was on the basis of praising the Irish humanitarian response and no more than that. We didn't get into the security issues as such.""  Ireland's military is neutral, and it is not a Nato member. Because of this Ireland sends only ""non-lethal"" aid to Ukraine, like medical supplies, body armour and helmets - not weapons. Asked about Ireland's military neutrality and Ukraine's international plea for arms, Mr Martin said his country would have to look at its position in the future but added: ""One cannot, in the middle of a crisis, change a long-held policy overnight."" He said Ireland was not morally or politically neutral. ""We're not a military power, what Ireland does best is on the humanitarian side and on the peace keeping side."" On Sunday, the government announced a scheme to offer UK households Â£350 a month to host refugees.  Unlike the EU, the UK has not waived its visa rules. On 9 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said about 1,000 Ukrainian refugees had received UK visas.  But some MPs have called for restrictions to be scrapped. How does the UK's visa scheme for Ukrainians work? The programme asked the taoiseach whether the talks on the Northern Ireland Protocol -  the post-Brexit trade arrangements which led to the recent collapse of Stormont's devolved government - would be ""kicked into the long grass"" because of the crisis in Ukraine  ""I think we should concentrate, obviously, on our response to Ukraine,"" Mr Martin replied, but he also said he believed it would also be possible to make progress on the protocol talks.  He suggested the war in Ukraine had showed the strength of international cooperation on ""big issues"", which gave him hope for agreement on the protocol. ""What's interesting - and I welcome this warmly - is the very strong partnership between the UK, the EU, the US on fundamental issues of substance - which is democracy; human rights; the freedom of the individual - and that is something that I think really trumps the issues. ""It really says to us all that we should be able to resolve issues to do with the Northern Ireland Protocol."" Mr Martin said access to the EU Single Market was important to Northern Ireland for inward investment but he added both sides were trying to find solutions.  However, he said he did not believe there would be a break-through before the Stormont election on 5 May.  He said some progress had already been made, and the EU had ""put forward a lot of sensible compromises and their mindset is to really resolve this, and I believe the foreign secretary (Liz Truss) is in the same mode of thought."""
Liverpool schools: The parents tackling admission policies,2022-03-13T08:00:49.000Z,"""It's like the children are fighting with the system, where the system's telling our children that they are second-class citizens."" Ismail Saleh is among hundreds of parents in Liverpool who could appeal against their children's allocated secondary-school places because they failed to get any of their five choices. He says his daughter is ""angry and depressed"" about potentially facing a two-hour round bus trip to a school outside her home in south Liverpool, which has the most popular schools in terms of preferences. ""My fear is racial discrimination - would she get home safe, would she get to school safe?"" Many other local youngsters also face long school journeys from this September because nearby Christian faith schools have been oversubscribed. Aurelie Maigrat is concerned that her son's admission in a school outside their area ""with no one that he knows"" could have a ""massive impact"" on him. ""Will he suffer discrimination as one of the few Muslim kids attending the school?"" she said. Dr Amina Elmi, from the Granby Somali Women's Group, has been lobbying for a change in schools admissions, saying: ""This is an issue that has been ongoing for decades - it's never been addressed. ""If an admission policy stops people from a certain community - from a certain race or faith - from getting into the schools in their locale, then it's up to Liverpool City Council to tackle and change that."" However the authority says they do not have the power to amend admissions policies for certain schools, including academies and faith-based schools, but they will work to find out if Muslim youngsters are missing out more than others. A recent council report reveals that the proportion of Liverpool children allocated their first preference fell this year, with 10% given places at a school that was not among their choices. This meant that 519 students were offered places as a result of not being granted any of their preferences - compared to 435 in 2021 and 385 in 2020. Councillor Tom Logan, cabinet member for schools, said the demand for places in south Liverpool was particularly intense. ""We've got really good, desirable, well-respected schools but lots of people find it difficult to get places at them.  ""A number of schools have admissions criteria that limit the number of places which are open to everyone and then they offer them on a random basis, so it doesn't matter where you live.""  He said there was also ""a cluster of schools with a religious element to their admissions policies so if you're not Catholic or from the Church of England or you don't want a faith-based education, you'll find it difficult to get a place as well"". ""The appeals process would normally be used for anomalies"" he said, ""but this year we are expecting hundreds of parents to appeal."" In a report circulated to councillors, Cllr Logan said the council had ""no silver bullet to fix the issue in secondary schools"". He has facilitated some advice sessions for parents who want to appeal although, given the demand for places, it is uncertain how many will succeed.  The green light has been given for one new free school but Councillor Logan said Liverpool was in ""such dire need"" of more pupil places that more schools were required.  He added that about 400 places in Year 7 were needed across the city ""over the next couple of years"" as the local authority plans its schools' strategy and works with the government to see where places could be needed.  Jonathan Jones, director of education and skills at the council, added that some of the city's schools had a historic ""reputation"" that deter parents, despite good results. But he said the council itself could not build a school to solve the admissions policy and that a free school or academy would have to be established by external trusts instead.

Saudi Arabia executes 81 men in one day,2022-03-12T15:17:09.000Z,"Saudi Arabia says it executed 81 men on Saturday - more than during the whole of last year. The group - including seven Yemenis and one Syrian national - were convicted of ""multiple heinous crimes"", including terrorism, state news agency SPA said. Some were charged with belonging to the Islamic State group (IS), al-Qaeda or the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Rights organisations say many do not receive fair trials in Saudi Arabia, an allegation the government rejects.  According to SPA, the latest group had been tried by 13 judges and gone through a three-stage judicial process. They were accused of plotting attacks on vital economic targets, killing or targeting members of the security forces, kidnapping, torture, rape and smuggling weapons into the country. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest execution rates in the world - fifth in a list compiled by Amnesty International, the other four being China, Iran, Egypt and Iraq.  It executed 69 people last year. "

Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroad,2022-03-13T01:41:10.000Z,"Outside Georgia's parliament, Yevgeny Lyamin heaves boxes of clothes and food parcels on to a waiting truck bound for Ukraine.  He is one of more than 25,000 Russians to have arrived in Georgia since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russians have been struggling to find affordable accommodation in all the major cities. Many can be seen wandering around the capital, Tbilisi, with their suitcases and often even their pets. A blue-and-yellow ribbon is attached to the lapel of Yevgeny's trench-coat - the colours of the Ukrainian flag. It was these ribbons that got him arrested at an anti-war protest in Russia, a day after it launched its war on Ukraine. ""I understood the best way to act against Putin's regime would be my emigration from Russia,"" says the 23-year old politics graduate. ""It's my responsibility to do anything I can to help the Ukrainians."" The exodus does not stop at Georgia. The EU, US, UK and Canada have closed their airspace to Russian flights, so they are heading for countries where flights are still permitted and where visas are not required, such as Turkey, Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Many have fled to Armenia. According to one estimate by a Russian economist, as many as 200,000 Russians have left their country since the start of the war. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Belarusians are on the move too, fleeing repression and the Western sanctions imposed on authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko's government for collaborating with Russia's Vladimir Putin. That has prompted prices to surge on last-minute flights and rental accommodation in the main host cities, such as Istanbul and Armenia's capital, Yerevan. ""A one-way flight to Istanbul cost me and my husband more than our combined monthly income,"" said Anya, who did not want to give her surname.  For her the moment of decision came with a new ""state betrayal"" law that has come into force in Russia. Anyone expressing support for Ukraine could face jail sentences of up to 20 years and Anya believed she could be a target. ""Fear of closed borders, political repression and forced military service is in our DNA. I remember my grandmother telling me stories about the state of fear they lived in during Stalin's time, and now we are experiencing it,"" she said. Many of the new emigres are tech industry professionals who can work remotely. A video games developer I met at a cafe in Tbilisi told me that he and most people he knew disagreed with Russian policy and they knew now that any protest would be violently suppressed. ""The only way we can protest is to leave the country, take our skills and money with us. Almost everyone in our circle has made a similar decision,"" said Igor (not his real name). He plans to leave the Georgian capital, because he does not feel welcome here.  There have been numerous reports of Airbnb hosts refusing to let their properties to Russian and Belarusian citizens. ""I do not accept Russian and Belarus people"" one host told a Belarusian couple, who shared their exchange with the BBC. ""You do not have time for vacations - revolt against your corrupt governments.""  ""They think we are running away from Russia because Apple Pay no longer works there,"" Igor complained. ""We are not running for comfort, we've lost everything there, we are basically refugees. Putin's geopolitics has destroyed our lives."" At Tbilisi's public service hall, new arrivals are registering businesses or applying for residency. Kristina and Nikita, who are both IT specialists from the Belarusian capital Minsk, have registered as sole entrepreneurs. That will allow them to open Georgian bank accounts. ""We don't support our governments, which is obvious because we ran away. We want to be safe here,"" said Kristina. ""But we are being bullied just because of our nationality, I need to hide my country of origin, I don't feel comfortable when people ask me where I am from."" Since the start of the war Tbilisi has seen some of the largest rallies in support of Ukraine. A recent survey found that 87% of Georgians view the war in Ukraine as their own war with Russia. But many Georgians are uneasy about this dramatic influx of Russians, as it is less than 14 years since Russia's leader invaded Georgia. Some fear President Putin might claim Russian citizens abroad need protection, because that was his excuse to justify sending troops into the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia in 2008. To date, 20% of Georgian territory remains under Russian occupation. However, tech entrepreneur Lev Kalashnikov thinks Georgia will benefit from what he asserts is the biggest brain drain in Russia's modern history. He opened a group for expats on the Telegram messaging app while standing in a queue. ""There were 50 people in front of me and 50 people behind me. They became my first subscribers and now we have nearly 4,000 members."" Members discuss where to find accommodation, how to open bank accounts, and whether or not it is safe to speak Russian in public.  Yevgeny Lyamin is already learning Georgian, practising Georgia's unique alphabet in an exercise book. ""I am against Putin, I am against war. I still can't withdraw money from my Russian bank account, but that's nothing like the problems that Ukrainians face.""

Indian evacuee: The kindness of Ukrainians saved my life,2022-03-13T00:59:06.000Z,"Smiling down the camera from his parents' home in southern India, with his dog Leo on his lap, it's hard to believe that only a few days have passed since Vishnu thought he was going to die as he sheltered from Russian shelling in the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia. Even though Vinnytsia is in western Ukraine, a long way from the Russian border, it has still faced attacks. Last week nine people died in a missile strike that destroyed the airport on the outskirts of the city, officials say. Polla Vishnu Vardhan Rao, 21, is one of the tens of thousands of Indian students in Ukraine to have escaped the country since Russia invaded.  He says the kindness of Ukrainians is the main reason he is still alive. Two weeks ago Vishnu had been enjoying life as a fourth-year medical student.  His days were spent attending classes at the university and in the city's hospitals, studying in the library, and swimming in the river with Leo. ""Ukraine is the most beautiful, peaceful country. In Vinnytsia there are so many peaceful places,"" Vishnu says. But on 24 February, the day Russia's invasion began, he woke up to ""blasting sounds, firing sounds"". He and his two flatmates, also Indian students, had no idea what was happening.  ""We were very panicked,"" he says. ""I see outside the window some Ukrainians running with bags - I don't know where they are going."" Irish student 'overwhelmed' after fleeing UkraineWhy so many foreign students were in UkraineIndian student killed in Ukraine as he bought food He'd never heard the sound of air-raid sirens and didn't understand the accompanying announcements blared out in Ukrainian. Luckily, Vishnu's Ukrainian neighbours could translate the warnings into English and explain that war had broken out.  ""They [said] some planes and tanks came and are fighting Ukraine - so don't go out, please stay inside,"" he says. Over the course of the next two days, Vinnytsia's sirens sounded every few hours, forcing Vishnu and his friends into the dark bunker beneath their apartment, which was full of rubble. He couldn't sleep, so spent hours on the phone, trying to work out a plan to escape the city. ""I thought: 'Maybe I will die in this situation,'"" he says. One of Vishnu's friends managed to find a Ukrainian minibus driver willing to take them to the Romanian border 250km (155 miles) away.  The driver, whose normal job involved taking people on day trips out of Vinnytsia, was not yet ready to leave the country himself because his wife was ill. So he agreed to make the risky trip, for which the group paid him a total of 12,000 Ukrainian hryvnia (Â£300).  Vishnu says he owes this driver his life.  ""I can't express - it's because of him, only, we got saved. I say to him thank you, from the bottom of my heart."" Vishnu was worried pets might not be allowed on the border, so he left Leo with his Ukrainian teacher and boarded the minibus. As the bus rolled through the roads of south-west Ukraine, Vishnu and his friends started to relax. There was one moment of tension when planes whizzed overhead - Ukrainian or Russian, Vishnu doesn't know - but for the most part they felt like they were moving to safety. But the worst part of Vishnu's journey was yet to come. When the bus driver dropped Vishnu and his friends off, they joined a throng of hundreds of people trying to pass through a gate at the border.  Vishnu says only Ukrainians were being allowed through - and each time he got close to the crossing, guards would ""drag"" him to the back again. Trapped Nigerian on friendship and terror in UkraineThe girl who wouldnât leave Ukraine without her dog After a whole day standing in an ever-growing crowd, Vishnu began to worry that he would never get through the border.  Pop-up cafes serving refugees had run out of food and drink, and Vishnu had finished the bananas and buns he'd brought with him as snacks.  Eventually he resorted to pleading with the guards to let him and his friends through. ""We [were] asking: 'Please let us pass, we [have been] standing for two days, we are getting pains, we don't have food, water. ""Finally, they accepted."" So Vishnu passed through the border with a few of his friends - but 13 of his original group of 20 were left behind. Speaking of how he felt in that moment, Vishnu said: ""Personally, I'm happy. But so many friends aren't. I'm selfish, at this point. We have to be selfish because it's our own life. We can't risk our life for our friends - so we moved on."" Everyone in Vishnu's group of 20 has since made it home to India.  But he remains worried about other friends in Kyiv - also Indian students - who are stuck in their bunkers as Russian forces continue to bombard the capital city with attacks. With the help of the Indian embassy in Romania, Vishnu was taken by bus from the border to Bucharest airport. His worried mum and dad smothered him with hugs and kisses when he landed at Rajiv Gandhi Airport in Hyderabad. A few days after he arrived to parents' house in Suryapet, Telangana, Vishnu was also reunited with his beloved Leo. His teacher in Ukraine had fled with her family to Moldova but took Leo on the bus all the way to Bucharest, from where the dog was flown to India. Vishnu says he and Leo couldn't have got home without the kindness of the people of Vinnytsia. ""I'm lucky, so many guys helped me - my neighbours, the bus driver, my teacher. ""Ukrainian people are very good people.""

Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion,2022-03-29T10:24:07.000Z,"Russia appears close to taking control of a key southern city, but Ukrainian counter-attacks elsewhere in the country are hindering Russian advances.  Here are the latest developments on day 34 of the invasion:  Ukrainian forces retake key areas to the north-west of KyivRussians advances around Chernihiv, Sumy, or Kharkiv stallBut port city of Mariupol looks likely to fall to Russians soonUkrainians still stopping Russian advances around KhersonSome Russian troops redeploying to eastern Donbas region Russia launched its attack in the early hours of 24 February, but more than four weeks into the war the battlefield across northern Ukraine remains ""largely static"", according to the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD).  Russian forces are attempting to hold ground while they reorganise and reset their forces, according to the MoD, but Ukrainian counter-attacks have pushed them back in a number of areas.  In Kyiv, Russia has been attempting to encircle the city for weeks now, but Ukrainian forces remain in control of large areas around the capital, especially in the south. Ukraine has launched a series of counter-attacks on the outskirts of Kyiv in the past week and regained some territory that had been occupied by Russian troops, including the suburb of Irpin about 20km (12 miles) to the west.  This has kept Russian artillery out of range of central Kyiv, but shelling of the outskirts continues to cause casualties and destroy homes and infrastructure - and the city remains vulnerable to missile attacks from the air.  To the east of the capital, Ukrainian forces reclaimed ground from the Russians over the weekend around the suburb of Brovary, about 20km (12 miles) away from the centre of Kyiv. The Russian advance on Kyiv from the east has been hindered by the failure to take control of Chernihiv, a major city to the north-east that sits between the capital and the Russian border.  Chernihiv's mayor says the city is surrounded by Russian forces, but Ukrainian troops remain in control of the centre at the moment. LIVE: Latest updates from UkraineODESA: City defies Russia and embraces signs of lifeFAMILIES: Bringing up a family among the bombsREAD MORE: Full coverage of the crisis Russian forces initially made rapid gains in the south, with their main objective being the creation of a land corridor between Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and areas held by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.  Standing in the way of that objective has been the port city of Mariupol, which has been encircled by Russian forces since the start of March.  Russian forces have been advancing further into the centre of the city in recent days, where Ukrainian officials have said some 160,000 civilians remained trapped. It appears the fall of the city is imminent, according to Jack Watling, a defence analyst at the Royal United Services Institute think tank. To the west, Russia has been attempting to push towards Odesa, with the aim of cutting off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea.  But their advances stalled at Mykolaiv, where a counter-attack by Ukrainian troops has pushed Russian forces back towards the city of Kherson. Ukrainian resistance around Kherson is continuing to stop any Russian advances in the area, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).  With recent setbacks elsewhere in the country, the chief of the Russian army said last week that the focus of its forces is the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas. The Donbas is made up of the Donestk and Luhansk regions, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the Russian invasion at the end of February.  Russian forces in the region appear to be concentrating efforts on encircling Ukrainian forces, advancing from Kharkiv to the north and Mariupol from the south, the MoD says. Western officials say several thousand Russian troops are on their way to the region and forces are also now being redeployed there from other areas of Ukraine, according to the ISW.

To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project.  From 2 March this daily assessment differentiated between ""Assessed Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory"" and ""Assessed Russian advances in Ukraine"", the latter indicating areas where Russians are believed to have launched attacks from but which they do not control.  To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily updates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research. The situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps."
Russia sanctions: How the measures have changed daily life,2022-03-13T01:34:57.000Z,"The US, UK and EU have put in place unprecedented financial penalties on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, and hundreds of international companies have pulled out of the country. The impact of these measures is just starting to be felt, with the cost of basic products rising, a looming risk of job losses, and for some, an increasing sense of isolation. Here are some of the ways daily life has been changing. All names have been changed, and currency conversions were correct at time of publication. Consumer prices jumped 2.2% in the first week of the invasion, with food among the biggest rises  â¢ Some shops are restricting the sale of staples, after reports of hoarding â¢  Sales of medicines are not subject to sanctions, but with major shipping companies suspending services, supplies could be hit The rouble has plummeted since Russia invaded Ukraine, leading many retailers to raise their prices. Daria, who lives in central Moscow, says she's not yet seen empty shelves. ""Food won't disappear but will get more expensive,"" she says. ""How much more expensive, I can't imagine - and am scared to even think about."" Jan, is an EU citizen who lives and works in Moscow. ""On 20 February I ordered groceries for 5,500 roubles [about $57; Â£44] and now the same basket costs 8,000,"" he says. The price of milk has almost doubled in the past two weeks, he adds. Sugar and cereal prices were already about 20% higher this February than a year ago. Russian state news agency Tass said some retailers had agreed to limit price rises on some staples to 5%. Others are restricting the amount of basics like flour, sugar and oil that customers can buy.  Daria has been stocking up. ""We bought 4kg of coffee, 4 litres of sunflower oil, 4 litres of olive oil and four bottles of whisky."" She has also ordered a three-month supply of medication for her high blood pressure - she says some drugs are already harder to get hold of. The price of some consumer goods has drastically increased â¢  The cost of smartphones and televisions has increased by more than 10% and an average vacation to Turkey has increased by 29% â¢  Major brands like Apple, Ikea and Nike no longer sell their products in Russia Daria had been considering buying new laptops for her family, and rushed ahead with the purchase as she saw prices steadily increase. ""At the beginning of February they cost about 70,000 roubles [$730; Â£560] but by the end of the month they had gone up to 100,000 roubles, which is what we paid. They then went up to 140,000 before they all sold out in Moscow."" They didn't buy iPhone chargers, though many others did - Apple said on 2 March that it would halt all direct product sales in Russia. ""We probably should have,"" Daria says. ""There's a joke now that we all have the last iPhone."" New cars have also gone up in price. ""We bought filters and oil for the car for when it needs a service,"" Daria says. ""We managed to buy them at the old prices before they almost doubled before our eyes.""  Pavel, a university lecturer with a wife and two children, was looking to buy appliances for their flat in Moscow. On the day the war started, he saw some prices rise by nearly 30%. He managed to buy a fridge, cooker, washing machine and a kettle, and ordered a bed and a cupboard from Ikea just a day before it closed. He doesn't think prices in Ikea changed. ""They simply didn't have time to raise prices,"" Pavel jokes sadly. The symbolism of McDonald's closing its 847 restaurants has not been lost on Russians - it was among the first Western firms to open in the Soviet Union 30 years ago. Within hours of the announcement, thousands of adverts appeared from Russians reselling food from its restaurants, at up to 10 times the usual price. ""Nuggets and pies bought just before the restaurant chain closed down. Your last chance to taste foreign bliss,"" said one message.  But Vladimir, who lives in Saratov in south western Russia, says he has yet to feel the impact of Western sanctions. ""Vatniki [Kremlin supporters] won't be affected by the fall in the rouble, because they don't buy expensive foreign goods."" Russian banks removed from Swift international payment system â¢ Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Apple and Google Pay limit their services in Russia â¢ Russian central bank says economy could shrink by up to 8% ""The situation has had a big impact on our business,"" says Natasha, who works in the fitness industry. ""Our customer numbers are down. People are asking us to refund their club membership. And our costs for rent, equipment and cleaning are all rising. Outgoings have gone up by 30% on average since sanctions were introduced."" She anticipates that many businesses like hers will close. Those that don't will struggle to find Russian manufacturers to replace imported equipment.  Ekaterina runs a number of language schools and says the sanctions have already caused her problems. ""We have teachers in other countries we can't pay because all the transfer networks are frozen. We also have students in the US, Germany and Latvia who can't pay their fees into our accounts. We've found ways around it but at the moment every working day begins with fire-fighting a new crisis.""  Ekaterina is worried how they will manage their international group lessons if Zoom is blocked, and says she has had problems because her online platforms were maintained by a company in Ukraine. ""Everything stopped immediately although we worked with them for ages. We were very happy with them and their work was top class. We are very upset for them, for ourselves, that we're all in this situation,"" she says. Natasha is finding it hard to come to terms with the changes. ""This is a completely new kind of crisis which makes us all feel lost and bewildered. Not just in business but in our own lives. The loss of income, having to give up a whole way of life, reduced connections, including on social media, and not being able to travel to see family and friends who live abroad. There are a lot of things we have already lost and haven't yet fully understood."" Daria says hearing about job losses as big international companies pull out of Russia worries her. ""So far there aren't any cuts in the government-funded projects I work on,"" she says, ""but I'm very scared of losing my job."" New law threatens to jail anyone deemed to have spread ""fake"" news on the invasion â¢ Independent and international media subject of severe restrictions â¢ More than 13,000 people arrested in anti-war protests  Daria holds President Putin responsible for the sanctions, but most Russians get their news from state-run media, which carries the Kremlin's anti-Ukraine propaganda. Many people support him and may end up blaming the West for sanctions. Others don't approve of the war, but stay silent - it's risky for Russians to criticise their leader. Western governments hope the sanctions being piled on Russians will hurt enough to bring change at the top, but that could take time. The view that only better-off Russians will feel the pain of sanctions is debatable. No-one is sure quite what's going to happen next, but the economic fallout is expected to be severe and long lasting.  Russia's central bank said there had been a ""drastic"" economic change since the invasion. On the surface you might not guess what's going on in Moscow, says Daria. The city's cafes and restaurants are full, the metro is working, the traffic jams in the centre haven't gone anywhere. ""That's if you don't see the protests, the searches and the departures of creative people who make a big noise about leaving. A lot of other people are probably quietly leaving too. This gives me the feeling that we're running out of air,"" she says.  Today's events bring back memories of the 1990s, when Russia's economy collapsed after the Soviet Union fell apart. ""It's been interesting talking to people in their 30s about those times and the ration cards we had for food. We had coupons and tokens to buy sugar, butter and vodka,"" says Daria.  ""I remember the huge queues to buy sausage... There were often loud arguments, against selling things to the out-of-town shoppers. It was shameful. I hope it doesn't come to that again.  ""I'm afraid that there will be more burglaries and robberies because of a sudden increase in poverty and job losses,"" she says.  Jan says he hasn't noticed life changing in a big way and he doesn't plan to leave. ""My family and my work are here. It's very hard to start life all over again in a new place."""
Ukraine war: Pictures of war intensifying in third week,2022-03-12T12:15:39.000Z,
"Under threat of Russian bombs, Lviv hides away its priceless heritage",2022-03-12T00:25:31.000Z,"In one room of the National Museum of Lviv, an enormous scaffold is bare. In another, brackets hang loosely from the walls. Plinths sit empty along the corridors and wooden pallets and cardboard boxes are strewn on the floors. The staff used whatever they could to pack away the museum's priceless artefacts in a hurry. As Russian shelling has devastated other parts of Ukraine, the picturesque western city of Lviv has been left untouched, so far. But it is bracing for war. Some preparations you can see in the open - the checkpoints on main roads and the soldiers on the streets - but some are taking place behind closed doors. In Lviv's galleries, museums and churches, a huge operation is under way to safeguard the city's cultural heritage. Thousands of artworks and artefacts have been carefully removed and taken to secret underground locations, or down to basement storage rooms. Ihor Kozhan, the director of the National Museum of Lviv - the largest art museum in Ukraine - took the BBC on a tour of its now empty rooms, which looked as though they had been looted. Climate-controlled display cases, usually home to artworks, icons and manuscripts dating as far back as the 14th Century, were bare.  Nearly every one of the 1,500 artefacts on display has now been removed from the museum. The other 97% of the collection - 180,000 pieces in total - was already in storage in some form.  ""Everything, everything is gone,"" Kozhan said. Despite overseeing the operation, Kozhan was amazed by the speed with which the 17th-century Bohorodchany Iconostasis - a grouping of religions paintings measuring 10m by 8m and one of the museum's most valuable pieces - had been dismantled by his team. It had taken six months to hang, piece by piece, he said, and less than six days to pull down from its scaffold and store away. Constructed and painted over seven years beginning in 1698, the iconostasis represents the high watermark of the work of the icon painter Yov Kondzelevych. It has been in Lviv since 1924, when the archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church brought it back to Ukraine from Poland.  It was dismantled and hidden from the Nazis in 1939, forbidden from display during the Soviet era, painstakingly restored in 2006, and now dismantled once more. There was no plan in place for the evacuation of the museum's artefacts before the invasion began two weeks ago, Kozhan said - not even after Russia began months ago to mass troops along Ukraine's borders.  ""There was no plan because no one could imagine this would happen,"" he said. ""We had no plan at all - not before the war, not even in December. You must understand, we did not believe it could come to this."" Around Lviv, cultural and religious officials are running complex operations to wrap up statues, seal off stained glass windows and spirit away sacred artefacts.  In the city's main square, fountains with sculptures of Greek gods and goddesses have been wrapped in flame-retardant fabric and covered with scaffolds to protect them from falling masonry. ""At first it was a bit chaotic but it has become more organised,"" said Liliya Onischenko, the head of Lviv's city council heritage protection office. ""We are photographing everything before we take it away and we are photographing all the pieces in their hidden places,"" she said Onischenko said the priority was protecting the stained glass windows in the city's historical old town, a Unesco world heritage site whose architecture was built over centuries by different nationalities - Poles, Austrians, Hungarians, Germans, Armenians - as the region changed hands. At the Armenian cathedral, a prized 15th-Century wooden sculpture of Christ on the cross was removed for the first time since World War Two and taken to a secret, safe place.  Other artefacts besides the sculpture have been removed, the deacon, Armen Hakopian said, but he would not elaborate. ""What needed to be taken out was taken out,"" he said, with a smile. The windows along the side of the 850-year-old Armenian cathedral are plain, because the original stained glass was blown out in the 1940s by German bombing. But above, stained glass remains in the cupola and the high parts of the church. The institutions of Lviv have had the benefit of time to prepare. And they may yet escape the violence. But there are grave fears for the cultural, religious and architectural treasures in the parts of Ukraine under attack. There has already been significant damage. The stained glass windows and nave of the assumption cathedral in Kharkiv were damaged by Russian shelling. Russian troops have reportedly destroyed a 19th-century wooden church in the village of Viazivka in Zhytomyr. And a museum in Ivankiv, north of Kyiv, was razed, destroying 25 works by the Ukrainian folk artist Maria Prymachenko.  Ihor Kozhan, the national museum director, said he feared that destroying Ukraine's cultural fabric was part of Russia's goal, and he feared greatly for Lviv. ""If the same damage is done here as in Kharkiv, Mariupol, it would be a terrible tragedy,"" he said.  ""This is a place of historical memory. The museums here hold the history of the nation. They give us an understanding of who we were, who we are, and who we will be. ""Russia wants to destroy that."" The job of emptying the national museum was virtually complete by Wednesday - only a few cardboard boxes of manuscripts were left, near the doors, alongside a sculpture lying on the floor - one of several too heavy to move that will be protected in other ways.  The artefacts that have been moved underground are on a clock - too long there without adequate climate control and they would begin to degrade, Kozhan said.  And they would not probably not survive a direct hit, he said, with a long sigh, because the bunkers are not designed to withstand powerful bombs. ""I hope we can bring them up soon,"" he said. ""It is difficult for me to be here in these empty rooms and hallways. We could have walked the whole day here together looking at our history and our art."" Asked to estimate the total value of the museum's works, Kozhan declined. ""Of course there is no number,"" he said.  ""If these things are destroyed they cannot be remade.""

Newspaper headlines: UK refugee scheme and plea to help orphans,2022-03-13T07:03:36.000Z,"Most of the papers focus on the UK's plans to house Ukrainians who have fled the war, or what the Sunday Express calls the ""Â£350-a-month thank you for giving refuge"". A man who survived the Novichok attack in Salisbury urges volunteers to sign up in the Sunday People. A government source tells the Sunday Telegraph that the payments to hosts will prove much cheaper than using hotels; in its editorial, the paper welcomes what it calls the government's ""open-door"" offer to Ukrainian refugees as ""generous and courageous"".  But in the Observer, the Refugee Council questions whether families will be supported as they care for highly traumatised migrants.  The Sunday Times leads on a claim by the governor of the Donetsk region that President Putin has wiped out the city of Volnovakha, saying all its infrastructure has gone.  People in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, which had been considered a safe haven, tell the Observer about their fears that the Russian troops are getting closer and closer. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Attorney General Suella Braverman warns that not just Russian leaders but ordinary Russian soldiers could face jail for war crimes committed in Ukraine.  She says they could be tried in the ""courtrooms of Kyiv, The Hague or even in the UK"". According to the Sun on Sunday, MPs have called on Boris Johnson to nominate Volodymyr Zelensky for an honorary knighthood. There's said to be cross-party support to honour the Ukrainian president.  The Sunday Times suggests he needs to decide whether to leave Kyiv and risk being labelled a coward, or stay, creating a threat to his life and to Ukraine's presidential succession. Allies insist he won't move. An investigation by the Sunday Times examines the peer, Evgeny Lebedev, and his past pronouncements on President Putin's actions, which it suggests makes for ""uncomfortable reading"". The paper says he questioned whether the former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, was murdered by MI6 rather than by the Russian security services and also defended the invasion of Crimea.  Lord Lebedev, who holds both British and Russian citizenship, has insisted he's opposed to the Ukrainian war and is not a Russian agent. Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox There's more concern for the Queen's health, with the Sun suggesting that she's too frail to walk her dogs. It says the monarch hasn't taken her pets out since October.  And several papers speculate on the contents of the chancellor's spring budget.  The Sun says Rishi Sunak has ruled out any ""big bazooka"" action to combat the cost of living crisis.  The Sunday Telegraph suggests options he may consider include reducing the rate at which Universal Credit payments are cut for people who work and a higher-than-planned increase in state benefits.  The Observer suggests there are calls from across the political spectrum for higher benefits and pensions; while the Sunday Times says MPs want him to slash fuel duty.  In its editorial the Sunday Times calls on Mr Sunak to ""grasp the nettle"" and at least delay the planned rise in National Insurance.

Will Russia's attack on Ukraine help thaw US-Venezuela relations?,2022-03-13T00:23:15.000Z,"The US and Venezuela have not seen eye-to-eye for several years now. This past week, however, has displayed signs that the relationship might be blossoming - or at least that seeds of co-operation are being planted, after the first high-level talks between US and Venezuelan officials in years. It's a new direction for the two countries. Washington has in recent years slapped sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector over President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's poor democratic and human rights record. Mr Maduro himself has a $15m (Â£11m) bounty on his head after being indicted in the US on charges including narco-terrorism, drug-trafficking, and corruption. President Maduro, in return, accuses the US of colonialism and bullying, and of trying to get involved - unreasonably - in Venezuela's internal affairs. It's not a comfortable rapprochement. These are desperate times, and desperate measures are needed. Oil helps make the world go round and Venezuela has a lot of it - and when the world is in crisis, such as with the ban on Russian oil exports causing prices to surge, leaders start revisiting those awkward friendships. ""In Venezuela, it's all about the oil,"" says political historian Prof Margarita LÃ³pez Maya. ""One of the first steps the US did in the Second World War was bring in a good ambassador [to Venezuela] to give support to the government - to secure that oil."" There's no doubt that a better relationship would benefit Venezuela, too. Mr Maduro wants to see sanctions lifted, and last week the president - a man normally so willing to criticise the US - offered an olive branch on state TV. ""The two flags of the US and Venezuela were there, they looked really pretty, the two of them, united as they should be,"" said President Maduro of the meeting in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, last weekend. ""A new opportunity has been opened. We had a respectful, cordial and very diplomatic meeting. It's time for diplomacy, truth and peace."" Indeed, Mr Maduro also said he was ready to return to talks with the Venezuela opposition, hosted in Mexico. And a few days after the US-Caracas meeting, Venezuela released two jailed US citizens. So far, so positive - but where will this thawing of relations lead? ""In the US, for a while now, internal forces have been saying that the strategy of oil sanctions didn't make much sense after all this time and its objective wasn't working,"" says Luis Vicente Leon, director of Caracas-based consulting firm Datanalisis. ""When the conflict with Ukraine started, it became clear that a policy of oil sanctions put it in a predicament."" Many see these talks as a marriage of convenience. But it's early days and still a tumultuous relationship. ""Both sides are hypocritical, I don't believe anyone,"" says Maria Eugenia Farina, a shop owner in Caracas. It's a feeling echoed by so many in Venezuela who have given up on politicians of any stripe being able to pull the country out of its crisis.  Others, though, are more willing to give these talks a chance. ""Do I see it as a positive? Yes, because Venezuela would go bankrupt, someone has to give,"" says Caracas resident Ana PÃ©rez. ""We are weak. If they lift sanctions, things can get better here."" Venezuela crisis in 300 words But anyone expecting a quick turnaround may be disappointed. ""They've had one trip and just a couple of meetings, so you couldn't anticipate that the tectonic plates would have shifted just yet,"" says Eric Farnsworth, vice-president of the Council of the Americas and a former State Department official. ""When you begin to realise how fundamentally difficult it is going to be to make a meaningful difference, then you begin to have second thoughts as to whether it's truly worth the effort to do that,"" he adds. Venezuela once had the capacity to produce around three million barrels of oil a day. It's now under a million. Any increase in production would require a great deal of investment - and that would also require an easing of sanctions. The Middle East, say experts, is the only solution in the short-term. ""Venezuela is currently exporting through China and Maduro is getting tons of money compared to the past two years,"" says Francisco Monaldi, the director of the Latin American Energy Programme at Rice University's Baker Institute in Houston. ""Having said that, the disruption of the markets that's happening will make Russians send tons of oil to China at a heavy discount, and that will disturb Maduro's business."" Therein lies the other big issue - the relationship between Russia and Venezuela. ""Violence is the expression of the capitalist world,"" Venezuela's Vice-President Delcy RodrÃ­guez said last week. ""Nato countries provoking a power like Russia. What are they looking for? The annihilation of the entire world? Venezuela raises its voice for peace. You will never see us in the war ranks."" So, could the US visit be more than just oil? An attempt to change Venezuela's political allegiances, perhaps? ""I just don't see how Maduro would perceive it to be in his interests to turn his back on the Russians in favour of a US administration which has him under indictment by the US Department of Justice,"" says Mr Farnsworth. ""What I do think will happen - and has maybe begun to happen - is that Venezuelans will just tone down the rhetoric a little bit."" From foes to frenemies? It's a plausible - and welcome - possibility. But not everyone is convinced. Additional reporting by Vanessa Silva in Caracas."
Xenotransplantation: Are pigs the future of organ transplants?,2022-03-13T00:34:47.000Z,"The frontiers of organ transplantation have been pushed further than ever before. The first organs taken from genetically engineered pigs have been put into people and the recipient of the first pig heart managed to survive for two months.  So how close are we to using pigs for a limitless supply of organs to solve the global shortage?  Silence descends on the operating theatre and the tension builds until it's almost a physical presence in the room. Surgeons have just connected a pig's kidney to a human body. The clamps have been released and human blood is now flowing into the pig organ.  ""You could have heard a pin drop,"" says transplant surgeon Dr Jayme Locke. Success or failure will be determined in moments and there is now just a single question on everyone's minds: ""Pink or black?"" If the body unleashes a horrendous assault on the foreign organ - holes will be ripped in every cell in the pig tissue and the organ will clot from the inside out. It will go splotchy, then blue, then completely black within minutes. If ""hyperacute rejection"" is avoided, the organ will blush pink with the flow of blood and oxygen.  ""It turned beautiful and pink... the sense of relief, the sense of joy and hope just filled the room. We might have high-fived as well,"" said Dr Locke, from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in the US. This operation was just one of a series of medical breakthroughs that have renewed interest in the field of xenotransplantation. Using animal organs in the human body is an old idea, and has ranged from ""zest for life"" chimpanzee testicle implants to replacement kidneys and hearts taken from our primate relatives. The latter often ended in death soon afterwards. The problem is, our immune system treats the transplanted organ like an infection and attacks.  The focus these days is on pigs, as their organs are roughly the right size and we have centuries of experience farming them. But the challenge of hyperacute rejection - keeping organs pink, not black - is the same. You can't just pop down to the farm, choose a pig and transplant its organs. It's taken huge advances in genetic engineering to alter pigs' DNA so their organs are more compatible with our immune systems.  Inside Health is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesdays at 2100 GMT - and Wednesdays at 1530 GMT. It is also available as a podcast on BBC Sounds.Listen to Pig organs for transplant patients The recent kidney and heart transplants have taken organs from the specially designed ""10-gene pig"". It has one genetic tweak to prevent any donated organs responding to human growth hormones and growing out of control.  Another key alteration removes a sugary molecule, called alpha-Gal, which sticks to the surface of pig cells and acts like a gigantic flashing neon sign marking the tissue as absolutely alien.  A wing of our immune system, called the complement system, is constantly patrolling the body looking for alpha-Gal. That's why organs can be rejected and killed moments after they are transplanted.  Two other ""neon signs"" were genetically removed and six human ones added in, acting like a camouflage net over the pig cells to help hide them from the immune system.  The resulting 10-gene pigs are then raised in sterile conditions so they are suitable for transplant.  The pair of pig kidneys were transplanted into the brain-dead body of Jim Parsons in September 2021.  He'd wanted to be an organ donor when he died and when his kidneys were donated, pig kidneys were put in their place with permission from his family. Dr Locke describes the moment one of the kidneys started making urine as ""remarkable"" and feels xenotransplantation can ""really change people's lives, and to be blunt, save their lives"". She's expecting to start clinical trials later this year.  That operation was a three-day-long experiment, but meanwhile, surgeons at the University of Maryland Medical Center were about to go one step further.  Their patient, David Bennett, 57, had severe heart failure. He was not deemed suitable for a human heart transplant and was being kept alive by an Ecmo machine, which supported his heart and lungs. Mr Bennett described having a pig heart as a ""shot in the dark"". A 10-gene pig was driven to the hospital and on 7 January, its heart was placed inside David Bennett's chest. The operation was tricky because Mr Bennett's diseased heart had swollen, so connecting the blood vessels to the smaller pig-heart was a challenge. Again there was the nervous moment to see whether the heart would be rapidly rejected, but it was beating and stayed pink. Dr Muhammad Mohiuddin, the hospital's director of cardiac xenotransplantation, said he did not expect to witness this ""in my lifetime"". When I spoke to him on the one-month anniversary of the operation he said there were no signs of the organ being rejected, but Mr Bennett was still frail. ""We put a new Ferrari engine in a 1960s car. The engine is working great but the rest of the body has to adjust,"" he said. But Mr Bennett died two months after the transplant. The cause, and therefore the implications for xenotransplantation, is still uncertain. Mr Bennett was very frail before the operation and it is possible that even the new heart was not enough.  No signs of organ rejection have been reported, but if detailed analysis of the heart shows signs of the immune system attacking it, the 10-gene pig may need further modifications to make its organs suitable for the human body.  Alternatively, it could come down to anatomy, and pig hearts may not be up to the job in a human body. Our hearts have to work much harder to fight gravity than a pig's because we walk on two legs rather than four.  Chris Denning, a professor of stem cell biology at the University of Nottingham, said overcoming hyperacute rejection meant the heart transplant would be considered ""a success"". He said if the issue was frailty, then xenotransplantation ""could be successful in the future"" but if it came down to anatomy then it could ""be potentially a show-stopper"". The hospital plans to continue doing clinical trials.  Pig hearts do not have to be as good as a human heart to still save huge numbers of lives, according to Prof John Wallwork, one of the UK's most eminent transplant surgeons. Many people die waiting for a transplant. Prof Wallwork, who conducted the world's first heart-lung-liver transplant and was an early pioneer of xenotransplantation, says it's better to give 1,000 people a 70% chance of survival with a pig heart than 100 people an 85% chance with a human heart.  ""So if it's not quite as good as human transplantation, then we've still done more good than not doing the 1,000 patients,"" he said. Xenotransplantation has always felt like the next big thing in transplant medicine. There's no doubt a series of landmark operations have been performed, but only more research will tell us whether the field - and its grand dreams - will ever come of age.  Dr Locke added: ""Our goal would be to have one 10-gene edited pig be able to save a patient with kidney failure, a patient with liver failure, a patient with heart failure and a patient with end-stage lung disease. ""That would be a remarkable accomplishment and I genuinely believe that we will be there during my lifetime.""

"'Without TikTok, I'd still be a wedding singer'",2022-03-13T00:54:43.000Z,"TikTok's viral sensations have been reshaping the musical landscape for some time.  For Chloe Adams, rather than touring the country singing at weddings, she can now exploit the video-sharing platform's new music service SoundOn. The space offers unsigned artists a way to upload songs and the metadata, get paid and find distribution. Before SoundOn's launch last week, Chloe had already attracted more than 1.2 million followers on TikTok. Like so many hits, her song Dirty Thoughts quickly attracted the TikTok audience first. It has since become popular on Spotify, with nearly 10 million streams. ""I became aware that building a large following on TikTok, or having my song go viral on TikTok, were some of the only ways that emerging artists break through these days,"" said the 24-year-old, who lives in Leicester. ""Before releasing and playing my original music became my full-time work, I was part of a wedding band and would play at tonnes of weddings around the country.  ""I was the lead singer and played my acoustic guitar too, that's where I'd be right now if I had no way to release my original music online."" Before SoundOn, artists behind the viral tracks used to have to leave TikTok to find distribution options. Now they can do everything in one place, using the app to push their music out to all the other streaming platforms, including Resso, Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, Deezer and Tencent's Joox. David Mogendorff, TikTok's UK head of artist partnerships, told the BBC: ""It feels like any new emerging artist in the UK is using TikTok as a place to get out there to start showing people what they can do, and to grow a fanbase."" SoundOn pays out 100% royalties to music creators in the first year and 90% after that, so the idea is it empowers new and undiscovered artists and allows their popularity to snowball. There are also no administrative fees. Although artists have been releasing music on platforms like YouTube for years now, some entry-level singers have struggled to make money - with only videos attracting a lot of views able to cash in on adverts.    With SoundOn, the artists have more artistic autonomy over what they release but they also have more power when it comes to signing with a potential record label, which is something they might choose to do further down the line. ""We want to do something that's really artist-friendly at that early point in their careers. Every penny counts and we wanted to give people a service that really works for them,"" said Mr Mogendorff.  The technology, which is owned by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance, means the artists can choose the model that is right for them, and choose to remain completely independent, but the bar is high. ""We have quite a strict moderation and editorial service in place to ensure people are uploading songs that belong to them and are appropriate for our community guidelines,"" he added. SoundOn is now fully launched in the US, UK, Brazil and Indonesia with not just Chloe, but Abby Roberts, Games We Play and Muni Long all signed up. The ability for streaming services to receive music directly from SoundOn has been largely welcomed by the industry.  Nigel Harding, vice-president of artist relations at Deezer, told the BBC, ""Launching SoundOn is a completely logical move for TikTok. ""The platform has a massive reach and a very strong music community, which of course creates a great appeal for emerging artists. ""From Lil Nas X and Olivia Rodrigo to more emerging talent like PinkPantheress and Shygirl â TikTok and other social platforms are fast becoming the default way to launch a music career."" SoundOn will offer a range of support for artists, including audience insight and development advice from a dedicated artist team. Beyond distribution, artists are mindful of getting their music in front of the right audience and that will always include traditional methods too, like buying albums and merchandise or going to gigs."
PGI status: Could Welsh leeks become the new Cornish pasty?,2022-03-13T07:04:57.000Z,"The Cornish pasty, Gower salt marsh lamb, Anglesey sea salt and now... Welsh leeks? Leeks grown in Wales could be given Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status and international recognition if an application is successful. The vegetable has been synonymous with Wales and formed part of its culture going back at least 1,000 years, according to food historian Carwyn Graves. Mr Graves said the ability to grow leeks in Wales' milder climate all year round had historically helped prevent malnutrition. Farmer John Addams-Williams said the national vegetable and emblem was unique and needed ""to be protected"". In the UK, PGI status is awarded by the UK government to protect and promote named regional food products that have a reputation or noted characteristics specific to that area.  There are worldwide schemes to obtain PGI status, which must comply with strict World Trade Organization rules. Should St David's Day be a national bank holiday?Camilla 'knights farmer' with leekSalt marsh lamb receives protected status There are currently 18 Welsh items on the UK Geographical Indication (GI) list, which includes the prestigious PGI designation. If accepted, it will mean only Welsh leeks will be able to be sold with the UK PGI logo, guaranteeing the leeks were grown in Wales. Mr Addams-Williams, who works at Puffin Produce in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, which applied for the new status, said it would represent ""a huge opportunity"" for the agricultural sector in Wales. ""Our leeks are different to those sold elsewhere - we need to support Welsh industry,"" he said. Many leeks sold in Wales are grown elsewhere, but Mr Addams-Williams said Welsh leeks were grown slower, have a stronger flavour and a ""vibrant flag"" used in national dishes such as Welsh cawl. ""The more things we have for our national identity - whether that be a daffodil or a leek - is very important and we need to protect the status. It is all part of our culture and history and the more we do the better it can be."" Food historian Carwyn Graves said: ""Leeks go back a lot longer than people would expect. ""Many countries have got plants symbolising them and some of those date back a few hundred years, but the Welsh leek may date back to the very first origins of Welsh nationhood."" He said there were tales of leeks being used by Welsh soldiers as a distinguishing marker during the Saxon era (410-1066AD), and of battles in leek fields. While there is not enough evidence to prove these narratives beyond doubt, Mr Graves said ""people were referring to leeks by the early Middle Ages as a kind of marker of the Welsh, so the mythology has been around for at least 1,000 years"". Queen presents St David's Day leeksA toast to Welsh whisky? Maybe by next ChristmasWelsh cheese awarded protected status He said leeks had also been used to symbolise Welsh people in the arts. Shakespeare's Henry V, written in about 1599, speaks of Welsh men wearing leeks in their caps, while an anonymous ballad from a similar time speaks of the vegetable being worn on St David's Day. Unlike other nations' symbols, such as tulips in the Netherlands, Mr Graves said the leek was actually useful to Welsh communities. He said they were ""probably one of the main things that kept the Welsh from scurvy"" as they grew all year round in Wales' milder climate. ""The leek is a great vegetable, really versatile and tasty, and one of the shortcomings we have in Wales is we don't grow enough veg and fruit here,"" he added. ""If more leeks were grown here it would only be a good thing."" Glyn Roberts, who is president of the Farmers Union of Wales, said PGI status would further increase awareness of Welsh produce. ""PGI status is more important now than it has been because we are in a global market and the food we produce in Wales is second to none,"" he added.

Isak Munda: The Orissa labourer who became a YouTube star,2022-03-13T00:59:28.000Z,"A daily wage labourer from India's Orissa state turned to YouTube after work dried up during the Covid lockdown - now, he is a social media star. BBC's Sandeep Sahu reports. When Isak Munda uploaded his first YouTube video in March 2020, he was desperate. A nationwide lockdown imposed to curb Covid had brought India - and the construction industry that employed him - to a halt. It left workers like him, who earned a daily wage, struggling for a living. Until inspiration struck.  His children were watching a cartoon on YouTube when Mr Munda overheard an advertisement on how people could earn money from the platform by uploading videos.  Why not try it, he thought to himself - he didn't have anything to lose. So, he scoured YouTube videos for tips and began with simple food videos.  In his first video, Mr Munda sits with a full plate of food - rice, dal, greens, a tomato and a chili - which he finishes in silence after greeting viewers.  It didn't take off like he had hoped. ""For about a week, no-one watched my video. I was disheartened,"" he says.   He decided to give it another shot - he returned to YouTube for help and found that many creators also promoted their videos on other social platforms. ""I opened an account on Facebook and shared my videos there. This time, it worked - 10, 12 people watched my videos."" Soon, he had his first viral video in which he relishes basi pakhala, a fermented rice dish popular in Orissa. ""It got me over 20,000 subscribers in a few days. People from all over the world - the US, Brazil, Mongolia - watched it,"" he recalls. It's all the encouragement he needed. Two years on, Mr Munda's channel - Isak Munda Eating - has more than 800,000 subscribers and his videos have been watched more than a 100 million times. Mr Munda himself is now visibly comfortable in front of the camera as he hosts village ""chicken parties"" and forages for mushrooms with his family.  Last year, he was praised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his monthly radio show for ""blending culture and cuisine"" to become an ""internet sensation"".  ""I was over the moon, and my subscriptions went up,""an ecstatic Mr Munda says. Conquering YouTube through YouTube   Mr Munda's videos fall into the ""mukbang"" genre of YouTube videos - people eat huge amounts of food, sometimes speaking to their viewers as they do it.  The trend started around 2010 in South Korea and Japan, and then spread around the world. Millions subscribe to popular mukbang channels, including MaddyEats from India. The genre's fans say they like playing mukbang videos in the background while they eat, especially if they are eating alone - they say it makes them feel less lonely.  But Mr Munda didn't know any of this when he began posting. He just went through different categories of videos before settling on food, which he knew he could cook with his wife's help. ""I thought viewers would be interested in seeing what our lives look like through food,"" he says.  And YouTube was his teacher - it's where he researched what camera to buy, how to shoot and edit videos, and even the recipes for the dishes he wanted to film himself eating. He withdrew 3,000 rupees ($39; Â£30) from his savings - a hefty sum for him - and purchased a smart phone to make videos. He paid the full amount in instalments.  He didn't finish school and knew little English. But he taught himself to use email, and social media to spread the word about his channel. He also learnt to use Google translate to add subtitles to his videos.  And he has got better.  The first video is just him eating his lunch, filmed in a single take. ""Hello, friends,"" he says in Hindi. ""I'm about to eat what you see on this plate"". After explaining what it is, he relishes his meal. But by February 2022 the videos are different. He doesn't shoot every meal or every day - instead he chooses special occasions, such as a village party. Indians from everywhere comment on his videos, comparing the food he is eating to what's cooked in their homes.  Many admire how he shared his life with no artifice. ""Their community feasting looks like so much fun,"" writes one viewer, and another says, ""He actually knows the value of food and how to respect it"".  Over time, Mr Munda's repertoire has expanded. From home-cooked close to his heart, he's moved on to taking requests from his followers to cook and eat different dishes. The northern Indian staple, aloo parathas, or  potato-stuffed flatbreads, and the Indian take on chow mein, have made an appearance.  Food challenges are also a part of the menu - in a rice eating challenge, he cooked the rice over a fire in the ground and then enjoyed it with his family.  ""We still eat simple food everyday,"" he says, although they can afford to eat meat more frequently now.  A future for his children When he worked as a daily wage labourer, Mr Munda earned around 250 rupees a day, for 18 to 20 days of work in a month. This was barely enough for a comfortable living for a family of six, and his parents. As his channel grew popular, Mr Munda's income jumped to around 300,000 rupees a month.  But when views go down, so does his income. He is now earning 60,000-70,000 rupees a month.  Still, with the money he's earned so far, Mr Munda has built a two-storied concrete house where his old ramshackle hut once stood. He says he's spent around 200,000 rupees on it.  He has saved money for his children's education, bought a second-hand car, and a laptop on which he edits videos. He has also become a local celebrity, and often throws lavish parties for the villagers, complete with chicken dishes.  Mr Munda's next goal: enrol his children in an English-medium school in the nearest town.  ""I want to give them the best possible education. If I could do this with my limited education, I am sure they will do much better if they study higher."" You can watch BBC Hindi's video on Isak Munda here"

Dudula: How South African anger has focused on foreigners,2022-03-13T01:32:27.000Z,"Police in South Africa are on alert in case of renewed clashes between residents of Johannesburg's Alexandra township and foreign street vendors.  Alexandra is one of the poorest areas of the country but from its shacks, residents can easily see the towering skyscrapers of Sandton, one of the richest commercial districts on the whole continent, just a few kilometres away. As a result people from across South Africa and neighbouring countries flock to the township to use it as a base to earn a living. Two controversial groups - the Alexandra Dudula Movement and Operation Dudula - which are campaigning against undocumented foreign nationals have emerged recently and support seems to be growing among South African communities who feel marginalised. There are concerns that their campaigns could lead to yet another outbreak of xenophobic violence in the country. Poverty is the main driver of the tension as South African residents believe - whether rightly or wrongly - that foreigners are the cause of many of their difficulties. Dudula is a word in the Zulu language which loosely means to ""push back"" or ""drive back"" - this gives a clue about what they want. Though the two groups are separate, they have been inspired by the same cause  - they both hope to drive out undocumented African migrants from their communities. They believe by doing this they can ensure that jobs and business opportunities go to South Africans. The Alexandra Dudula Movement was founded last year. The people behind it alleged that foreign nationals were illegally occupying government-issued housing in Alexandra, which is supposed to be for poor citizens.  But the campaign has expanded to include a call for all undocumented African migrants to stop trading in Alexandra. Last month, the movement closed down all the stalls owned by foreign nationals who could not show the correct papers for running the business or a valid passport.  They then assigned the stalls to South Africans, such as Alexandra resident Wendy Sithole, who started selling vegetables when the foreigners were forced to stop. ""We as South Africans are unemployed and are going hungry. All we want is to get jobs too,"" she told the BBC. ""How do they expect us to survive in our own country?"" Not all of the group's actions have been legal and the authorities are investigating cases of public disorder and intimidation.  Operation Dudula is based in Johannesburg's Soweto township - more than 25km (16 miles) away on the other side of the city. Founded by 33-year-old Nhlanhla Lux Dlamini, it came to prominence last June when Soweto residents marched through the township on what was called a ""clean-up"" operation.  It targeted suspected drug dealers and people who were alleged to be illegally occupying government property.  But just as in Alexandra, the group's scope of interest has expanded. Members now want the many foreign shop owners in South Africa to shut down their businesses and leave the country. They also want small businesses, such as restaurants and shops, to only employ South African citizens. This is because campaigners believe these places overlook South Africans and hire undocumented migrants instead because they can pay them less than the minimum wage.  Authorities have said while this may happen in some places it is not a widespread problem.  Both groups have denied that their motives are xenophobic and argue that they are simply protecting the livelihoods of South Africans, something they say the African National Congress (ANC) government is failing to do.  They both say they are not affiliated to any political party. From foreigners there is a sense that they are being blamed for wider problems. ""We're not taking anyone's job, we create our own opportunities, we're not stopping South Africans from doing the same,"" Mozambican Sam Manane, who has been selling snacks in Alexandra for the past 10 years, told the BBC. ""We're just being targeted."" The national government has not yet reacted but the premier of Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg, the ANC's David Makhura, has said he is concerned about the recent violence against foreign nationals in Alexandra. He called on civil society groups to work with the government to promote peace and tolerance. But some opposition parties are trying to make political capital out of the issue. One that is taking a hardline approach is the newly formed Patriotic Alliance (PA) led by ex-prisoner Gayton McKenzie. The PA, which has some local council seats but has not yet run in a national vote, wants all undocumented migrants to leave the country.  Earlier this year, members of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters unexpectedly visited restaurants in Johannesburg to ""inspect"" the ratio of foreign workers employed and to put pressure on business to hire more South Africans. On the issue of checking peoples' status, the government has said that it is doing more to ensure the people have the correct documentation - but that will take a while. This is not the first time there has been an upsurge in anti-foreigner sentiment in South Africa. In 2008, there was a wave of attacks across the country against refugees and migrants - more than 60 people were reported to have been killed and thousands displaced.  There were further outbreaks of violence against non-South Africans in 2015, mostly in the cities of Durban and Johannesburg, which led to the deployment of the army to deter further unrest. And three years ago another rise in attacks on foreigners led to hundreds of Nigerians leaving the country. It is not clear exactly why the issue is coming up again but South Africa's numerous economic problems have been exacerbated by the impact of Covid-19 mitigation measures which resulted in the loss of countless jobs and a sharp spike in the cost of living.

War in Ukraine: Russian forces accused of abducting second mayor,2022-03-13T12:17:31.000Z,"Ukraine's government has accused the Russian military of abducting another mayor in an area that it has captured. Yevhen Matveyev was seized in the southern town of Dniprorudne, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted, accusing Russia of ""terror"" tactics. Earlier, Russia installed a new mayor in Melitopol, after allegedly abducting the city's previous incumbent. Ukraine's president also accused Russia of trying to create ""pseudo-republics"" to break his country apart. In her first public appearance, Melitopol's newly installed mayor Galina Danilchenko urged residents not to take part in ""extremist actions"" and declared her main task was construction of ""basic mechanisms under the new reality"". Hundreds of people took part in a protest outside the city hall on Saturday to demand the release of previous incumbent Ivan Fedorov, who had refused to co-operate with Russian troops since they took the city on the third day of the invasion. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Mr Fedorov was last seen on Friday evening being dragged away from the city's crisis centre by several armed men with a bag over his head.  Ukrainian officials shared a video of the incident and said the armed men were Russian soldiers. ""We are not co-operating with the Russians in any way,"" Mr Fedorov had told the BBC earlier in the week. ""They have not tried to help us, they cannot help us, and we do not want their help."" Russian authorities have not commented on his disappearance, but the prosecutor's office of the Russian-backed breakaway eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk has reportedly accused him of ""terrorist activities"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has demanded Mr Fedorov's immediate release and asked the leaders of Israel, Germany and France to put pressure on Russia to free him. In his latest video address on Saturday night, Mr Zelensky said Russia was to create ""pseudo-republics"" in Ukraine. He praised those refusing to collaborate in the Russian-controlled Kherson region. The council there had earlier adopted a resolution reaffirming that it ""has been, is and will be an inalienable part of the united state of Ukraine"" in response to what it said was a Russian plan to stage a referendum on the creation of a ""people's republic"". Mr Zelensky also warned ""certain figures"" of dire personal consequences of any collaboration - an apparent reference to Ms Danilchenko.

Ukraine war: 'Sky turned red' as missiles hit Lviv military base,2022-03-13T14:43:37.000Z,"Witnesses to a deadly Russian attack on a Ukrainian military base have told how ""the sky turned red"" as missiles struck the site near the Polish border. At least 35 people died in the strike on the Yavoriv training base, near a major crossing point into Poland used by refugees from the conflict. Russia fired around 30 cruise missiles at the base, outside the city of Lviv, early Sunday, the local governor said. Hours after the attack, ambulances were still rushing to the scene.  Roads leading to the facility were blocked with checkpoints and authorities were conducting search-and-rescue operations. Russian jets fired around 30 cruise missiles at the site, also known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, authorities in Lviv said. Most, though, were intercepted by the air defence system. Video of the aftermath of the attack posted online and verified by the BBC showed a huge crater at the site and thick smoke billowing from a massive fire at a small building nearby.  Dukhnych Vitalii, a 19-year-old student who lives in a nearby apartment complex, said ""the night sky turned red"" as the attack happened. ""We can't hear the air raid sirens in this area. We woke up when we heard the sound of the first explosion. We went to the bunker,"" he said. ""It looked scary."" His 25-year-old cousin was training at the facility, Mr Vitalii said, and his family were still trying to contact him. Another resident, Nadin Berezovska, said she could see the fire from her parents' flat, where she had been living after fleeing the country's capital, Kyiv. ""It was very scary. We're in shock,"" Ms Berezovska, a 39-year-old photographer, said. ""Now we realise that it doesn't matter where you live,"" she said. ""We aren't safe. How can Poland be safe?"" The base has previously been used for military training of Ukrainian troops, often with instructors from the US and other Nato countries. It was not immediately clear whether foreign instructors were at the centre when it was hit. The attack is significant because the base, one of Ukraine's largest military facilities, is located just 25km (15 miles) from Poland, a Nato member. The border with Poland is a vital route for refugees, but also for weapons being sent by countries in the military alliance - which have included anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. It is also the first major attack in western Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion of the country, on 24 February. The region has become a hub for millions of people escaping the war in other areas, and around 2.6 million have left Ukraine so far. ""We're very scared,"" Yurii Vitiv, a 50-year-old driver, said. ""Until this morning we had hoped that the war would stop on eastern Ukraine."" Hours earlier, Sergei Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, said Moscow had warned the US that ""pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn't just a dangerous move, it's an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets"". LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbySANCTIONS: Impact on everyday lives in RussiaEXIT: Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroadRECRUITS: Ukraine's teenage soldiersIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict Despite sending weapons, Nato has, so far, ruled out a request by Ukraine's government to establish a no-fly zone over the country, saying this would trigger a wider conflict with Russia. But Andriy Sadovyy, the mayor of Lviv, said such a measure was necessary to prevent Russia from carrying our aerial strikes. ""Europeans, understand this situation: it's easy to talk and drink coffee and say they're deeply concerned... but every hour the skies are not closed, the Russians are killing civilians and children,"" he told the BBC in an interview. ""We need closed sky. We need decision today. We need bullet-proof vests today, not tomorrow. Tomorrow Russian missiles [will] end up in the European Union."" Ms Berezovska, the photographer, agreed. ""In Ukraine, there's no place to hide,"" she said. ""We ask Nato to close the sky.""  Additional reporting by Orysia Khimiak Are you or your family in Lviv?

"No-one raised security concerns over Lord Lebedev with me, says Michael Gove",2022-03-13T12:44:48.000Z,"Michael Gove has said no-one raised security issues with him about Lord Lebedev after reports security services had long-held concerns about him. The Sunday Times claimed the head of MI6 was worried about the Russian-born businessman, and concerns were raised with Boris Johnson in 2020.  But the PM has denied he intervened to ensure Lord Lebedev's peerage. Housing Secretary Mr Gove told the BBC the process for appointing peers was ""rigorous"". He said he had dinner with Lord Lebedev at Boris Johnson's house before the Brexit referendum, but did not know of any possible security concerns. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the PM had ""serious questions to answer"" about the appointment, and has asked the House of Lords Appointment Commission to release the vetting advice they gave to Mr Johnson. And speaking at his party's spring conference, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for a full public inquiry into the PM's decision to give Lord Lebedev a peerage.  He told party members: ""The cosy relationship between Putin's oligarchs and the Conservative political elite has been the dirty secret of the British establishment for far too long."" Iâm not a UK security risk, Russian-born peer saysJohnson denies intervening over Lebedev peerageWho are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Lord Lebedev was given his peerage in July 2020. He has denied posing a ""security risk"" to the UK, writing an article in the Evening Standard newspaper - which he owns - saying: ""I am not some agent of Russia."" The son of billionaire Russian banker and former KGB officer Alexander Lebedev, who moved to the UK as a child, has condemned President's Putin's actions in his newspaper, writing: ""I plead with you to stop Russians killing their Ukrainian brothers and sisters."" And he has warned it is ""crucial we do not descend into Russophobia"" during the war in Ukraine. An article in the Sunday Times last week claimed security services withdrew their assessment that giving the honour to Lord Lebedev posed a security risk after the PM got involved. The newspaper said that in March 2020, the commission that vets peerage appointments advised the prime minister against granting the newspaper owner a seat in the House of Lords, due to security concerns. But Mr Johnson, who ultimately decides who gets a peerage, is said to have responded to the advice by claiming it was ""anti-Russianism"". The PM denied the report, saying it would ""obviously be extraordinary"" if he had intervened, ""but that's not the case"". But in another Sunday Times article, the newspaper claimed the head of MI6 had held concerns about the businessman for as long as a decade. Asked on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme about the reports, Levelling Up Secretary Mr Gove said he was ""not aware of any of the concerns that had been expressed until they appeared in the newspapers"".  He added: ""Of course there are questions that are going to be asked, but no one has ever said to me that there are any specific security concerns that they have about Lord Lebedev."" The government minister also pointed to the fact Lord Lebedev was a British citizen, adding: ""I think it is important to draw a distinction between Evgeny Lebedev's father, who obviously... worked for the KGB, and Lord Lebedev himself, who is someone who has made his home in this country. ""There is a distinction to be drawn between the actions of parents and the actions of children."" But Labour leader Sir Keir has written to the chair of House of Lords Appointment Commission, Lord Bew, asking for vetting information to be made public, and for him to ""commit to a review of the propriety of Lord Lebedev's place in the House of Lords"".  Speaking to Sky News' Sophy Ridge, he said: ""I think the prime minister has got serious questions to answer. What did he know? And did he override security advice? ""Let's have a process to look into what actually happened, what did the prime minister know and what did he do in response to that. I think that is the least we are entitled to in relation to this appointment."""
Why I want to share my home with a Ukrainian refugee,2022-03-13T13:41:18.000Z,"People in the UK are being asked to offer a spare room to Ukrainian refugees. But what is it like sharing your home with someone who has fled war or persecution? For the third time in a year, John Rutherford and his wife Sue are considering opening up their south London house to a refugee. ""We have a big house, my kids have left home,"" says John. ""It's not a great hardship for us to make some space for a refugee."" In 2021, they hosted one person from Ethiopia and one from Iran, each for a couple of weeks while they awaited longer-term accommodation during the asylum application process. And now, he is ready to open his five-bedroom house again. He says: ""It was the sheer numbers involved that made me want to help. The fact that this is only down the road... means there is even more obligation for us to be hospitable. ""There could be four or five million people looking for places to stay, so the UK has to do its bit and the British people have to do their bit."" He says the system for Ukrainian refugees will involve a bigger commitment than his Ethiopian and Iranian guests - the government are asking for people to offer a place to stay for at least six months. But John says hosting refugees can be very rewarding. ""I really enjoy meeting people and talking to people from different cultures,"" he says. ""I just found the experience absolutely fascinating, talking about their country, their experiences, their culture."" He says his refugee guests wanted to be useful. The Ethiopian made a meal for his hosts to introduce them to his country's cuisine, while the Iranian repeatedly offered to use his professional skills to repair things around the house. But he advises anyone considering being a host to be ""patient and understanding"" - and to learn as much about their guest as they can, in order to offer them the right kind of environment. ""A lot of refugees will be severely stressed, maybe they even have PTSD,"" John says.  ""Chances are, refugees have had terrible experiences, and you have to know when to give them some space and some peace and quiet, or when they might want companionship."" He suggests finding out about their interests; whether they want to attend a church or other religious services; whether they have hobbies; or whether they prefer peace and relaxation or keeping busy. But with the Homes for Ukraine scheme requiring people in the UK to identify a named refugee they can host, John questions how many people who might want to help - but don't have a personal connection with a Ukrainian - could be matched with someone. LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbySANCTIONS: Impact on everyday lives in RussiaEXIT: Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroadRECRUITS: Ukraine's teenage soldiersIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict On previous occasions John hosted refugees, it was arranged by the charity Refugees At Home, which visited him to check on the accommodation being offered and asked about any house rules. He then received information about the refugee they hoped to place with him - with details such as their age, country of origin, and whether they spoke English. John says he is concerned about the lack of a similar system for Ukrainians, with the government suggesting people in the UK could make contact with refugees via social media. ""I am concerned about what support mechanism there will be,"" he says. Since the Ukraine scheme was announced, John has contacted Refugees at Home, and urges anyone considering opening their doors to see it as an opportunity.  ""It might be challenging,"" he says, ""but it can also be very enriching.""

Brent Renaud: US journalist and filmmaker killed in Ukraine,2022-03-13T21:44:33.000Z,"A US journalist working in Ukraine has been shot dead in the town of Irpin, outside Kyiv, police say. Brent Renaud, 50, was a journalist and filmmaker who was working in the region for Time.  Kyiv's police chief Andriy Nebytov said he had been targeted by Russian soldiers. Two other journalists were injured and taken to hospital. It is the first reported death of a foreign journalist covering the war in Ukraine.  One of the injured journalists, Juan Arredondo, told an Italian reporter he had been with Renaud when they came under fire. ""We were across one of the first bridges in Irpin, going to film other refugees leaving, and we got into a car"", he said in a video published on Twitter.  ""Somebody offered to take us to the other bridge and we crossed a checkpoint, and they start shooting at us. So the driver turned around, and they kept shooting; there's two of us. My friend is Brent Renaud, and he's been shot and left behind... I saw him being shot in the neck.""  Photographs are circulating online showing a press ID for Renaud issued by the New York Times. In a statement, the newspaper said it was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Renaud's death but that he had not been working for the newspaper in Ukraine. Renaud last worked for the publication in 2015, the Times said, and the press ID he was wearing in Ukraine had been issued years ago.  Time editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and Ian Orefice, the president and chief operating officer of Time and Time Studios, said they were ""devastated by the loss"". ""As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,"" the statement said.  Renaud had reported from Afghanistan, Iraq and Haiti. He won a Peabody Award for his work on a 2014 series on Chicago schools, Last Chance High.  He often worked alongside his brother, Craig, also a filmmaker. It is not known whether Craig also travelled to Ukraine.  Renaud's death comes less than two weeks after Ukrainian journalist Yevhenii Skaum, a camera operator for the Ukrainian television channel LIVE, was killed when a TV transmission tower in Kviv was hit by shelling.  A few days later, a British journalist covering the war in Ukraine was shot and wounded after coming under fire in Kyiv.

M&S and Asos among firms trying to hire Ukraine refugees,2022-03-13T16:55:01.000Z,"Major UK businesses are lining up to offer jobs to Ukrainian refugees when they start to arrive in the UK. A group of more than 45 large businesses is pressing the government to make it easier for those driven out by Russia's invasion to come to the UK.  Marks & Spencer, Asos, Lush and recruitment giant Robert Walters are some of the firms involved. The government has been criticised over the speed and scale of its response to the Ukraine refugee crisis. The initiative is being led by British entrepreneur Emma Sinclair, the chief executive of Enterprise Alumni. She said it had quickly gained ground in a short space of time. The project is in its early stages, and many of the details about how it will work in practice are unclear. Ms Sinclair, who is co-ordinating the initiative at the moment despite a recent head injury, told the BBC that many of her ancestors were from Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. The aim of the project is to help ""tens of thousands"" of refugees not only get jobs in the UK, but to help them find accommodation, and gain language skills. Many UK businesses have been facing labour shortages due to a combination of factors including Covid and Brexit, and it is in their interests to fill outstanding vacancies. However, Ms Sinclair said the consortium was ""purely altruistic"" and not acting to promote any particular corporate agenda. The companies involved, especially the recruitment firms, have got ""thousands of jobs to fill every day of the week"" - this is not a new situation for them, she said. ""People are inherently generally good, and people want to help,"" she added. The initiative, which was first reported in the Sunday Times, wants to provide tens of thousands of jobs. Ms Sinclair is due to have a meeting with the newly appointed Minister for Refugees Richard Harrington on Monday, and she has also been in contact with Number 10 Downing Street. ""We [businesses] want people, we need people, and we want to help,"" she said. ""We want to see movement on rising numbers of refugees."" She said the current focus of this initiative is to help refugees from Ukraine rebuild their lives, but in an ideal world the scheme would be extended to all refugees. The government has been criticised, including by its own MPs, for not moving quickly enough to help refugees from Ukraine. Ms Sinclair said that the UK ""can do better"" and ""go faster"" than it is currently on Ukraine refugees. ""We want to see the red tape burnt,"" she said. A government spokesperson said: ""We are standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians which is why we've made it easier for those with valid Ukrainian passports to come here. This is alongside changes to visas to ensure Ukrainians in the UK can stay here.  ""We have expanded our visa application capacity to 13,000 a week, deployed additional staff across the EU, with a 24/7 helpline in place to ensure those who need appointments can get them to come here.  ""This allows us to balance security risks while welcoming those in need,"" they added. Marks & Spencer, which is part of the consortium, said it was ""absolutely committed to supporting Ukrainian refugees"" both through humanitarian schemes and through jobs. ""We are in discussion with the Home Office about the detail of this,"" it said. Online fashion retailer Asos, which is also involved in the initiative, said: ""We are currently recruiting for many tech engineering roles in the UK and we know Ukraine has a strong skill set in this area. ""We are also working with our partners to explore opportunities at our distribution centres in the UK and elsewhere in Europe."" Asos expects the number of positions to be in double digits in the UK, adding the business already has a Ukrainian workforce in Poland so opportunities for newly arrived refugees will exist there. High street cosmetics business Lush said it was ""happy to consider refugees for any role, even those we would usually advertise for internal candidates only"". It said its recruiters are meeting with the Refugee Council charity next week to ""share what potential opportunities there are across the business"". Lush added that it was recruiting web developers and other tech roles, designers, spa therapists and warehouse and retail assistants - and from May and June, temporary staff for the Christmas period. Toby Fowlston, chief executive of recruitment giant Robert Walters, said the firm had ""committed to hiring displaced Ukrainians into our own business and as a recruitment company we will also represent them as potential employees to our clients"". ""We will need government support to help expedite working visas to ensure we can act quickly."","" he added.  Another large UK recruitment firm Impellam Group is part of the consortium, as is software company Unit4 and Portman Dental Group.

However, she warned that for a six-month placement, both the refugees and the people offering space in their houses need to be screened, otherwise it ""might be a little dangerous"". Ms Nathan added that the processes for dealing with Ukrainian refugees also needed to be fair to refugees of other nationalities. ""What happens to Afghans?"" she said. ""They are still in hotels."" Organisations that are not linked to the initiative have also contacted the Home Office to say they are willing to offer refugees jobs, include Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and the Co-op. More than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion, and European Union countries have let them come in without a visa for three years. In the UK, at the moment only Ukrainian refugees with family connections in the UK can apply for a visa under the Ukraine Family Scheme. Other visas are available but application centres in Ukraine are closed. However, under a new scheme called Homes for Ukraine, people will be able to nominate a named individual or a family to stay with them rent-free, or in another property, for at least six months. Sponsors will not be required to know the refugees in advance and there will be no limit on the number of people who can come to the UK through this route. Refugees will be given three years leave to remain, with the right to work and access public services."
Ukraine: Ambassador to UK calls for more support and says his country will fight,2022-03-13T18:01:36.000Z,"The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK has called for Britain to do more to help his country. Vadym Prystaiko, addressing a Downing Street rally, called for more support, weapons and humanitarian assistance as Russia continues its invasion. Hundreds gathered at the rally with chants of ""stop Putin"" being heard and calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The UK has rejected a no-fly zone over fears it would start a Europe-wide war with a nuclear-armed power. ""We need support, we need weapons, we need humanitarian assistance,"" Mr Prystaiko said. He added: ""We will fight. We will bring [Putin] down."" Demonstrators shouted ""stand with Ukraine"" and ""shelter our sky"", and held banners with ""stop Putin"" written in mock blood.  Some in the crowd called for a no-fly zone to be established over Ukraine, while others wanted the UK to take in more refugees.  No-fly zone calls rejected by defence secretaryWhy a Ukraine no-fly zone is a no-go for the WestHeartless or doing its best to help refugees? UK in crisis mode Campaign group London Euromaidan, set up by Ukrainians living in London, organised the protest. They want the UK to expel Russian companies and oligarchs that support Putin's regime from London. It comes as Ukrainian cities face heavy shelling from Russian forces, including at a military training base near Poland. Katya, a Ukrainian attending the protest, told the BBC more help was needed for Ukrainian refugees, including those who do not have family ties in the UK. She said: ""A lot of people just lost their homes, just help them to live in these difficult times... ""Already more than two million people have left Ukraine. Countries such as Poland take a lot of refugees and it has become a humanitarian catastrophe.  ""I think the UK should allow more people to come and stay here."" The protest follows criticism of the government - including from its own MPs - over the speed and scale of its response.  The government has offered households in the UK Â£350 a month to open their homes to tens of thousands of people that could come fleeing war in Ukraine.  A separate Ukraine protest also took place outside the BBC's headquarters, near Oxford Circus, and was heading to Parliament Square.  On Saturday hundreds of protesters demonstrated outside Downing Street. "

Unions warn of job losses if rail firms close ticket offices,2022-03-13T22:22:35.000Z,"Jobs on the railways ""will need to change to become more passenger-centric"", according to the group that represents train operators. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) was responding to reports that hundreds of rail ticket offices could potentially close as part of a plan to modernise the railways.  RDG said it is talking to unions about how to address job changes.  One union said it will ballot staff if compulsory redundancies are used. A spokesperson for the RDG, which represents the rail industry, said: ""The pandemic has been an unprecedented financial shock to the railway.  ""While no decisions have been taken over ticket offices, with the acceleration of changing travel patterns and more passengers migrating to digital technology, many jobs will need to change to become more passenger-centric.  ""Train companies are working with unions on how to address those changes, while making sure the industry takes no more than its fair share from the taxpayer,"" they added. The bosses of rail operators are in talks with the government about the closures, which may result in redundancies if staff cannot be moved into other roles, the Sunday Times reported. During the pandemic, train passenger numbers collapsed and so did revenues.  Living costs rising at their fastest rate for 30 yearsAir fares rise are unavoidable, warns airline bossMayors call on government to reassess rail plans Passengers numbers are still recovering, with big changes such as hybrid working affecting commuter levels and season ticket sales.  To ensure the railways kept running during the pandemic, the government stepped in to finance the industry.  Recently, rail minister Wendy Morton told the BBC that taxpayers had supported the railways with more than Â£14bn of funding, and that taxpayers had to get a good return on what they had invested.  As part of plans to modernise the railways, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps committed to modernising ticketing with more digitisation, as part of the Williams-Shapps plan for rail.  Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, said: ""Grant Shapps needs to realise that this daft plan is likely to result in the threat of compulsory redundancies, and if that happens we will be issuing ballots for industrial action. ""Closing ticket offices will not only be opposed by the unions but the public at large.  ""Shapps must stand up to the faceless accountants in the Treasury because a properly run and fully functioning railway is vital in building an economic recovery from Covid.   ""The government should share their plans in detail with us and commuters now if they are so sure that closing ticket offices and taking Â£2bn a year out of our railways is the best way forward.   ""I'd strongly urge them to reconsider,"" Mr Cortes added. Railway ticket offices are run by train operating companies in different stations, and not by Network Rail. "
Oxford Russian Orthodox church ransacked in burglary,2022-03-13T14:47:27.000Z,"A Russian Orthodox church was ransacked and several valuable items were stolen after it was broken into. St Nicholas the Wonderworker in Oxford was burgled in the early hours of Saturday, causing a ""great deal of damage"", Archpriest Stephen Platt said. Collection boxes for Ukrainian refugees and the church's safe were forced open and relics and crosses were stolen. Thames Valley Police are investigating and Sunday's service was able to go ahead as normal.  Writing on Facebook, Father Stephen said: ""Fortunately, although the holy table was interfered with, the antimension and the tabernacle containing the Holy Gifts were left undisturbed.  ""The church safe and money boxes were forced open with violence, and the proceeds of a collection to support refugees from Ukraine was stolen. The church bookstall was burgled and stock taken.""  The church, in Ferry Road, is a parish of the Russian Orthodox Church within the South East Deanery Deanery of the Diocese of Sourozh.  A Thames Valley Police spokesperson said investigations are ongoing and that no one has been arrested.  Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Rod Stewart: Video prompts pothole DIY repair warning,2022-03-13T13:16:18.000Z,"A council has urged people not to try to repair potholes themselves after Sir Rod Stewart was filmed doing it. Instagram videos showed the singer, 77, shovelling gravel near his home near Harlow, Essex, claiming drivers were ""bashing their cars up"" on the road. His post was liked more than 75,000 times in a day and prompted comments praising his actions. An Essex County Council cabinet member warned anyone attempting to repair a road could become liable for accidents. Lee Scott, who is responsible for highways maintenance at the authority, said: ""You can't take matters into your own hands. ""People must always report potholes to the council and we will fix anything that's dangerous."" In the Instagram post, Sir Rod claimed the road had been in need of repair ""for ages"" but that ""no-one can be bothered to do it"". Dressed in a tracksuit and high-vis vest, he explained why he and ""the boys"" decided to fix it themselves. ""People are bashing their cars up. The other day, there was an ambulance with a burst tyre. My Ferrari can't go through here at all,"" he said. Mr Scott promised he would ""endeavour to rectify it"" and asked for an officer report as quickly as possible. He said: ""All road repairs have to be done to a professional level or the person doing it could become liable for any problems or accidents"". He added he would be happy to arrange a meeting with the singer to discuss the issue. The BBC has approached Sir Rod for comment. Dominic Zarian from the area spent about Â£130 on car repairs after being unable to avoid ""a massive crack"" in the road, which he says he reported to the council four weeks ago. He said: ""That road is dark, when it's wet it can be treacherous. Someone's going to get hurt."" Essex County Council's pothole webpage said all reports were inspected but ""the timescale for the repair depends on the risk assessment and which type of road the pothole is on"".

Poland feels the strain of Ukraine's refugees,2022-03-13T20:16:17.000Z,"The kicks are high and the punches straight, but the Ukrainian children here are delivering them in an environment of peace: a karate class for new arrivals in eastern Poland.  The 14 students are given the basic moves by a Polish teacher, who ensures there's plenty of laughter. For this hour at least, the trauma they've gone through in the past fortnight is replaced by enjoyment. Some of them have family back at home fighting for real. Fourteen-year-old Dariy Gulyk hasn't heard from his father for three days and is worried. The emotions make it hard to feel settled here. ""In Poland, it's very cool"", he says, ""but we want to go home - because home is home."" His cousin, Sasha Minaiev, 17, appreciates the temporary distraction. ""When we're in the karate class, we forget about the war in that moment"", he says, ""but when it ends, we remember again, and we understand we must do all we can to help our people in Ukraine."" The class takes place in the small eastern Polish town of Zamosc, population 60,000. Its beautiful old centre, a Unesco World Heritage site, is dotted with Renaissance churches and coloured facades: a far cry from the horror unfolding across the border. It, like many others across Poland, has been transformed in the past two weeks into a refugee hub. On some days, up to 35,000 people have arrived - most going on further west but some staying. Around a thousand beds have been provided at the reception centre, schools, private homes and even the sports club where the karate class takes place. The mayor, Andrzej Wnuk, says it's a huge strain on Zamosc, warning that the welcome has its limits. ""Polish people seem infinitely ready to give, but it will end one day"", he says. ""We thought there would be a first wave of refugees and then we would get significant support from the government and the EU but it turns out we were left alone. We need financial help or the quality of our hospitality will drop drastically."" The impulse in Zamosc to offer refuge is partly due to its history as a place that has known the cost of oppression. Almost half of its pre-war population, some 12,000 people, were Jews. During occupation first by the Soviets and then the Nazis, most were sent to the ghetto here and then to concentration camps. A monument to the tragedy, made from the headstones in the town's old Jewish cemetery, stands on the outskirts. The locals here are proud of their heritage of hospitality, extended to the new arrivals. The restaurant at the Renesans hotel is now only cooking for refugees. In the kitchen, pots of Ukrainian beetroot soup and fruit compote bubble away, as staff box up portions of pork ribs and pasta. The owner, Damian Poterucha, says as a father, it was a natural decision to change his business once he saw the children fleeing the war. ""I can't believe Polish people are responding like this"", he says, ""it's nice to see."" But he says he's running short of money and can only continue offering the handouts for another two weeks. ""After that, I will think about what I can do next"", he adds. The food is delivered to the main shelter, where some 300 volunteers help out. All the while, buses arrive with new arrivals - and others leave, taking those on board to larger cities in the west, where many of the refugees have friends or family. ""We need help from the world"", says Barbara Godziszewska, a town hall employee now helping to serve hot food. ""Everybody looks at us and gives us a 'bravo', but it's too small - someone needs to tell us what we can do with the refugees. If the numbers continue like this, I'm afraid maybe they'll go on the street to sleep because every hotel is full."" In the space of a fortnight, Poland has gone from rejecting migrants from the Middle East to opening its arms to those from Ukraine. There is discomfort among some Poles with what appears to be a volte-face by their government, from pushing away the mainly Muslim men of Syria to welcoming the predominantly white, Christian women and children of Ukraine.  But Poland's migration policy will be pored over by historians in future years. For now, the focus is on the present influx. And as the fighting worsens in Ukraine - and begins to spread to the west - towns like Zamosc are wondering how long they can cope.

War in Ukraine: What happened on day 18 of Russia's invasion,2022-03-13T20:26:55.000Z,"On day 18 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a military training base in the western city of Yavoriv was struck by a barrage of cruise missiles.  At least 35 people were killed and 134 injured in the deadly attack at the facility, near a major crossing point into Nato member Poland.  Video of the aftermath of the attack posted online and verified by the BBC showed a huge crater at the site and smoke billowing from a fire at a nearby building. Witnesses told the BBC how ""the night sky turned red"", sparking fears that the conflict would soon spread to the up-to-now peaceful regions in the west.  Fighting continued in areas outside the capital Kyiv, and a US journalist was shot dead in the town of Irpin.  Brent Renaud, 50, was a journalist and filmmaker who had previously worked for the New York Times, though he was not on assignment for the publication in Ukraine. Kyiv's police chief Andriy Nebytov said he had been targeted by Russian soldiers. Two other journalists were injured and taken to hospital. It is the first reported death of a foreign journalist covering the war in Ukraine. Inside the capital, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen spoke with teenagers who had volunteered at a centre in Kyiv to fight for Ukraine. Most of them were in their late teens, not long out of school. They told our correspondent that after three days' basic training they would head for the front line - or very close to it. Some of them were wearing knee pads that looked too small. A few had sleeping bags. One had a yoga mat. ""I feel a bit scared, as no-one wants to die, even if it's for your country. So, death is not an option for us"", 18-year-old Dmytro told him.  In the UK, the housing secretary announced the details of a scheme designed to accommodate Ukrainian refugees.  Under the Homes for Ukraine plan, people will be able to nominate a named individual or a family to stay with them rent-free, or in another property, for at least six months. A website to express an interest in being a sponsor will launch on Monday. Ukrainians on the scheme will be given leave to remain for three years, with the right to work and access public services. Sponsors would get a ""thank you"" payment of Â£350 a month. Critics of the plan say it falls short of what is needed. On the red carpet, the actor Benedict Cumberbatch hinted that he hoped to take in a refugee. ""What we all have to do is continue to put pressure on our politicians as far as the refugee crisis goes, continue to put pressure on the Putin regime, continue to help in any which way we can - whether that's through donations or housing refugees, all of which I'm looking to do - and have done"", he said.  According to one estimate by a Russian economist, as many as 200,000 Russians have left their country since the start of the war. The EU, US, UK and Canada have closed their airspace to Russian flights, so they are heading for countries where flights are still permitted and where visas are not required, such as Turkey, Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Many have fled to Armenia. The BBC's Rayhan Demytrie spoke to Russians who have arrived in neighbouring Georgia. Many can be seen wandering around the capital Tblisi, with their suitcases and often their pets.  ""I understood the best way to act against Putin's regime would be my emigration from Russia,"" Yevgeny, a 23-year old politics graduate told her. ""It's my responsibility to do anything I can to help the Ukrainians.""

William Hurt: Oscar-winning actor and Marvel star dies at 71,2022-03-14T01:24:50.000Z,"William Hurt, the Oscar-winning US actor whose roles ranged from acclaimed 1980s dramas to Marvel films, has died at the age of 71, US media say. Hurt won the best actor Oscar in 1986 for playing a prisoner in a Brazilian jail in Kiss of the Spider Woman. He was nominated two more times in the next two years, for Children of a Lesser God and Broadcast News. In recent years, he has been known as General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross in five Marvel blockbusters. Hollywood website Deadline quoted a statement from Hurt's son Will as saying: ""It is with great sadness that the Hurt family mourns the passing of William Hurt, beloved father and Oscar winning actor, on March 13, 2022, one week before his 72nd birthday. ""He died peacefully, among family, of natural causes. The family requests privacy at this time."" Variety said the news was confirmed by Hurt's friend Gerry Byrne. Fellow Marvel actor Mark Ruffalo wrote on Twitter: ""Wow, another Major loss to the acting community. Great actor. Great mind. RIP."" Matthew Modine described him as ""a consummate professional"" who was ""continually searching for greater truth and human understanding"". Antonio Banderas said ""a great actor has left us"", while other tributes came from Russell Crowe, M Night Shyamalan Rebecca Front.

That year, he also starred as a womanising lawyer in erotic thriller Body Heat, before being cast in The Big Chill and Gorky Park. Winning an Oscar for playing a gay man who shares a cell with a political prisoner in Kiss of the Spider Woman was ""very isolating"",he later told the Los Angeles Times. ""The instant they gave it to me, I thought, God, what do I do now? How am I going to walk into a room and have any other actor trust me?"" That did not stop him getting two more consecutive nominations, though, before roles in The Accidental Tourist, Lost in Space, Contagion and AI. Then came a fourth Oscar nomination for David Cronenberg's A History of Violence in 2006. He also received Emmy nominations for playing Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2011's Too Big to Fail, and for legal TV drama Damages. He returned to the theatre in productions including Henry V, A Midsummer Night Dream and Hurlyburly, the latter of which saw him recognised with a nomination at Broadway's Tony Awards.  He was regarded as a compelling but complex and often confrontational presence, however. Fame was ""a challenge"" and ""not a happy condition for me"", he admitted. ""It's a privilege and a responsibility, and I'm not sure I carried the responsibility well at times, which is embarrassing,"" he told The Telegraph in 2013. ""And I've had to look and be disappointed in myself occasionally for how I behaved in some circumstances."" He drank heavily for a spell and in a high-profile palimony trial in 1989, former partner Sandra Jennings described his drunken rages. Another former girlfriend, Children of a Lesser God co-star Marlee Matlin, later accused him of physical and emotional abuse. He apologised ""for any pain I caused"". The actor revealed in 2018 that he had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer."
Zhytomyr: Aerial attacks hit city that is corridor to Kyiv,2022-03-14T00:39:01.000Z,"Since the start of the invasion, most of the world's attention has focused on Russian attacks on the east and the south of Ukraine, as well as the areas around Kyiv.  But just west of the capital, in the Zhytomyr region, residents have faced massive daily bombardment - killing civilians and leaving many without homes. In the first two weeks of the invasion, Russians have launched over 40 rocket and air attacks on the city of Zhytomyr itself and surrounding towns and villages.  Dozens of people have been killed, both troops and civilians. So why is Russia attacking this part of Ukraine so heavily? The city, which had a population of about 280,000 before the war, is a key point in the logistical and humanitarian corridor, Zhytomyr's mayor Serhiy Sukhomlyn tells the BBC. Aid from Europe is being delivered to Kyiv and further east via Zhytomyr, and refugees are travelling in the opposite direction. ""In order to intimidate Zhytomyr, they are hitting both residential and industrial buildings, targeting infrastructure,"" says Mr Sukhomlyn. As a result of bombing, water and gas supplies have been hit. But the mayor says local services are managing to mend a lot of the damage, ensuring most of the city has water and heat. Mr Sukhomlyn says the city also has a reserve source of water which will be used at this time of emergency. The constant attacks on the city forced many to flee, either to western Ukraine or other countries. But at the same time, the Zhytomyr region itself has been sheltering evacuees from regions further east. Many are now using it as a transit point before evacuating further. Zhytomyr has also become a hub for attempts to deliver aid to the towns and villages to the north-west of Kyiv, which have been hard-hit - and in some cases completely destroyed - by the fighting. Russian invading forces put maximum effort into cutting off roads between Kyiv and Zhytomyr. While the city and surrounding areas are heavily bombed, ground fighting is still around 60km to the east, on the outskirts of Kyiv. But the bombings are taking a heavy toll on Zhytomyr's population.  One resident, Nina, says during the first week of fighting, her street - mostly made up of single-storey private homes - was entirely destroyed. Three of her neighbours were killed and dozens more were injured. A local hospital was also bombed which meant the amount of medical help which could be provided was limited. ""It sounded like the plane was very low, nearly touching us,"" Nina tells the BBC. ""The ground was shaking. How could they not see they are bombing residential areas?""  There is a military base in the Zhytomyr region which could have been a target for a Russian attack but it is a long way from her destroyed home. As soon as she heard the air raid warning siren, Nina ran with her children to a neighbour's house and managed to hide in their basement. But her neighbours - a mother with three children - did not manage to get to the shelter in time.  ""The mother is in a bad state - her head and stomach were hit by flying glass, she has shards in her lungs."" After suffering a bad leg injury, Nina's daughter's boyfriend has had to have a metal plate fitted into his knee. Nina has since left Zhytomyr and is heading to Poland. She can't stop crying: ""Our only hope is now in God"", she says. Her daughter is choosing to stay in Ukraine with her boyfriend. Zhytomyr and the surrounding region have been bracing themselves for a possible direct attack from Belarus.  For a few days there were reports that a ground offensive was a distinct possibility. The Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko claimed, without evidence, Ukraine was getting ready to attack his country. Even though Zhytomyr mayor Serhiy Sukhomlyn says he has no time for Mr Lukashenko's accusations, he stresses that the city is well-protected against a ground offensive.

How to spot false posts from Ukraine,2022-03-14T00:48:17.000Z,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered a wave of falsehoods on social media and the airwaves. In a new Radio 4 podcast series, War on Truth, our specialist reporter follows the stories of people caught up by misinformation - and gives some tips about how to avoid it.  Since the war began, my inbox has been flooded with messages from people telling me about misleading videos on their social media feeds and troll accounts promoting conspiracy theories.  And it's not just on social media - it's also state-sponsored propaganda pushing false claims on air and beyond.  In a new podcast series, I'll be reporting on the information battle being waged over Ukraine - and hearing from the ordinary people sucked into it.  How can you spot bad information - and stop its spread?  There are very real, distressing videos being shared of what's happening on the ground in Ukraine. But there is also footage from old conflicts going viral. Often people share it because they're shocked - or even trying to help. But it's just adding to the chaos for those in the country. The best way to figure out if a video is real or not is to look for clues - like the weather, the road signs, the languages people are speaking.  Videos of Russia's invasion of Crimea and from the blast in Beirut in 2020 have been shared widely, pretending to be from the current conflict.  Using Google Maps, you can figure out if the video is really from where it claims to be. And by using reverse image searches - available from a number of websites - you can see if that same video or image has been shared online before. That's a tell tale sign that it's been recycled from a previous event.  Newsround: How to tell what's fake and what's realFalse claims the war is a hoax go viral It's important to examine who shared a post in the first place. Can you verify who they are - and are they a trusted source? Those who have posted misleading videos are sometimes looking for likes and shares. It's a distressing time - and posts about what's happening in Ukraine are likely to catch on. Others are sharing false claims to push certain narratives - to boost their political agendas or to sow doubt and confusion. Several young people in the country have told me about pro-Russia accounts which argue with Ukrainians, suggesting without any proof that the war is ""staged"" or Ukraine is bombing its own territory.  Ukraine invasion: Misleading claims continue to go viralHow you can stop bad information from going viralHow to verify videos One man I interviewed explained to me that even pictures of his home near Kyiv totally destroyed by bombs couldn't convince these trolls. Many of them have few or no followers, have taken their profile image from other places online and use generic usernames. They also only started to post after the invasion began. It's hard to tell who ultimately is running these accounts.  Other accounts that have promoted false claims about the Covid pandemic have turned their attention to sharing false conspiracy theories about the war. The same false tropes - for instance that those injured by bombing are ""actors"" - have come up again and again, and have even been pushed by Russian diplomats. LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbySANCTIONS: Impact on everyday lives in RussiaEXIT: Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroadRECRUITS: Ukraine's teenage soldiersIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict A lot of what's on social media about the war is frightening. It triggers a reaction - and that means people sometimes share posts before checking if they're real. Disinformation spreads because it plays on our emotions and our biases.  It's not just about negative emotions - sometimes hopeful stories can also go viral. While they may boost morale, they contribute to the chaos online and make it harder to figure out what's actually happening.  The information war is about more than social media. It's a battle fought by governments in both Ukraine and Russia, which are pushing out propaganda. Question why a particular source might be saying something - and whether it's backed up by evidence.

Newspaper headlines: 'War at Nato's door' as Putin has 'West in sights',2022-03-14T06:03:25.000Z,"Most papers are preoccupied with the Russian missile attack on a military base close to Ukraine's border with Poland. ""Putin's deadly warning to the West,"" is the Daily Mail's front-page headline. The paper has seen a British intelligence report that says the strike was designed to illustrate Russia's willingness to escalate, should the West continue sending supplies to Ukraine. Unconfirmed reports in the Times say the site has been used as a storage depot for anti-tank weapons and surface-to-air missiles, sent to bolster Ukraine's forces.  Fighters from the base returning to Poland after the attack had British, American and Irish accents, according to the Daily Telegraph. One describes the bombardment as being like hell on earth.  Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox Several of the papers pick up on claims that Russia has dropped phosphorus bombs on a town in eastern Ukraine, in violation of the Geneva conventions.  The Daily Mirror says the chemical can burn to the bone, with agony lasting for months. Local officials quoted in the Telegraph say the weapons are causing indescribable suffering.  There's a distressing account in the Guardian of alleged atrocities by Russian soldiers, in villages near Kyiv.  Witnesses who have fled to the capital describe house-to-house searches and killings, with phones and laptops being confiscated.  A woman says she saw her husband beaten and shot dead in the street after he approached Russian forces with his hands raised. He had to be buried in the garden, she goes on to say, because the Russians wouldn't allow them to use a graveyard. The Financial Times and the Washington Post are among papers to say they've been told by US officials that Russia has requested military equipment from China.  There are no details on what Moscow has requested but the papers quote senior White House figures as warning Beijing not to try to circumvent sanctions.  An expert in Chinese defence policy tells the Post that while Russia has sold arms to China, this has never been reciprocated. Any change would be a ""watershed moment."" The Times reports that Downing Street is backing plans for a big expansion in solar-power generation, and for the building of another new nuclear power plant.  It's part of Boris Johnson's new energy strategy in light of the conflict in Ukraine, the paper explains.  Under the proposals, to be announced this week, people would be given incentives to install solar panels at home.  Plans to build a nuclear power plant on Anglesey, which collapsed in 2020, would also be revived. A source tells the Times:  ""It's just the Treasury that needs to be convinced"".  The Sun looks ahead to Boris Johnson's trip to Saudi Arabia this week, describing it as perhaps the most important foreign visit of his Premiership so far.  The paper says allies - not least the United States - will be hoping the Prime Minister can convince the kingdom to massively boost oil production, curbing inflation here, and easing the world's reliance on Russian oil.  The Sun notes what it calls the Saudis' ""hideous war in Yemen"" - and that they will want something in return. But it says such is the price of diplomacy at a time of world tension. "
Baftas 2022: Seven highlights - from the jokes to the dresses,2022-03-14T01:50:38.000Z,"Dune might have won the most prizes, but The Power of the Dog proved too powerful when it came to the night's top categories at Sunday's Bafta Film Awards. The Benedict Cumberbatch-starring western took home best film and best director for Jane Campion, standing it in good stead ahead of the Oscars at the end of this month.  Elsewhere, Rebel Wilson made an assured hosting debut while the likes of Will Smith, Troy Kotsur and Ariana DeBose cemented their status as Oscar frontrunners.  Here are seven highlights from this year's ceremony, which marked a return to a full-capacity in-person event at the Royal Albert Hall. The Baftas are a more serious and formal affair than a lot of other awards shows, and it can be pretty difficult to get a laugh from the audience.  As a result, a couple of host Rebel Wilson's jokes fell a little flat, but we thought on the whole the Australian comic actress did a fine job, delivering some solid one-liners in her opening monologue.  ""You guys might be like 'why is Rebel Wilson hosting the Baftas, isn't she Australian?' Yeah I come from the bush, but if you think about it, don't we all?""""Everyone's asking me me why did I lose weight, well clearly it was to get the attention of Robert Pattinson. Just joking, I did not lose weight for a guy, I did it to get more acting roles.""""Lady Gaga is nominated for House of Gucci. Apparently they all had Italian accents in that film, I didn't notice."" ""Tom Hiddleston is here but he isn't nominated tonight, he's just here Loki.""""We wanted to open the show with a Bond number, because Bond is turning 60, and his girlfriends are turning 25.""""I'm proud to announce the new James Bond will be me. Bond goes to Australia and it'll be called Die Another G'Day.""""The next award is for best original score. Mine was actually the last time I was here at the Baftas, when I got Idris Elba's phone number."" ""Next time I think I'll consult the weather report, and perhaps wear a little less fabric?"" the best supporting actress winner told press backstage following a slightly rainy red carpet. But unknown to many, her stunning Oscar de la Renta dress actually doubled up as a political statement - when put together with that of her West Side Story co-star. ""Did anybody see what Rachel Zegler's wearing? Because the two of us together are standing with Ukraine, like seriously, we are reflecting it in colour,"" she said. It wasn't the only reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the ceremony. Woody Norman, the 13-year-old star of C'Mon C'Mon, and Boiling Point star Stephen Graham both wore ribbons on their suits in the colours of Ukrainian flag. Benedict Cumberbatch, meanwhile, wore a blue and yellow badge.  ""It's horrific what we're seeing daily,"" he told BBC News on the red carpet. ""We all have to continue to put pressure on the Putin regime, continue to help in any way we can, whether that's through donations or housing refugees, all of which I'm looking to do and have done."" The musician's film Summer of Soul picked up best documentary, but we were mostly just impressed he was awake enough for the Baftas given his gruelling schedule.  Questlove went from the DGA Awards in Los Angeles on Saturday night to the Baftas in London on Sunday afternoon. Oh, and he also has to be in New York for his regular job on Monday night - his group The Roots are the house band on a US chat show. ""I'm going to go straight to the airport [after the Baftas] and tomorrow I have to be at work at The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,"" he explained, but added there was one last place he wanted to visit before leaving London. ""Actually, when she was with us, Amy Winehouse introduced me to a spot called Beigel Bake, it's a 24-hour bakery. When we first started our friendship, that's how she would always end my London trips, so I always go there and honour her."" If you happened to be in Brick Lane late on Sunday night, that really was Questlove you saw buying a rainbow bagel.  More from the Baftas 2022: The winners and nominees in fullBafta Film Awards 2022 red carpet in picturesCampion's cowboy film wins top Bafta Award The Coda star has become an awards season favourite and stands a strong chance of winning the Oscar for best supporting actor following his Bafta victory. ""I feel like it's a big pay-off for the many years of an extremely tough journey,"" the deaf actor said backstage through an interpreter. ""It was hellish at times, I feel like a survivor. ""At times I slept in the back of my car, I couch surfed, and on the set of A Streetcar Named Desire, I slept on the bed on set because it was just so hard for me to survive back then as a starving actor."" Kotsur is now getting the most recognition of his career thanks to Coda, which was directed and adapted by Sian Heder. ""It took a long time for Hollywood to accept actors who happen to be deaf. With Coda, it was really the right team, right director, right script,"" he said. The After Love star snared the best actress Bafta despite the film not being a major player at other awards ceremonies this season. Scanlan is perhaps best known for her role in the excellent TV political satire The Thick Of It, so could her first Bafta for a movie role mean that she's more likely to concentrate on film projects in future? ""Well film and TV are changing, aren't they? So I guess I'll be changing with it,"" she said. ""Some of those boundaries are collapsing, and the way we tell stories is changing because of the platforms that we're receiving those stories through. So I'm just going to go with that flow, ride that wave."" You may have heard that the Oscars have controversially decided this year to pre-record eight of their 23 categories in an effort to save time during the telecast.  At the Baftas, best editing winners Elliot Graham and Tom Cross from No Time To Die were asked what they thought of the Academy's decision, which has been unpopular within the film industry. ""I'm glad you asked that. Speaking for myself, I'm not a fan,"" said Cross. ""I think it taints the entire proceeding - it's not what the Academy of Motion Picture, Arts and Sciences is about.  ""I feel lucky to have attended before, and I just think every Academy Awards statue is gold - it's not silver, it's not bronze. All of those nominees deserve to stand up."" His co-winner Elliot Graham agreed: ""I grew up wanting to be an Academy member, it's that dream come true, and I think it's [messed] up, they need to think about it."" After Drive My Car was named best film not in the English language, director Ryusuke Hamaguchi opened his acceptance speech by joking: ""Well that got rid of my jet lag, thank you!"" Explaining more during the press conference backstage, he said: ""I only arrived in this country yesterday, so it's about 5am Japan time right now."" Following in the footsteps of major recent awards players like Roma, Parasite and Minari, Hamaguchi acknowledged how attitudes towards films with subtitles have changed. ""The thing that makes us feel that is the change and acceptance of these films in the UK and the US,"" he said. ""The influence of Parasite two years ago on this has been huge, and the next generation of Asian films is here ready to go."" With just a fortnight to go, all eyes will now turn to the Academy Awards on 27 March, which will mark the culmination of awards season."

Reproductive coercion: 'I wasn't allowed to take my pill',2022-03-14T01:15:17.000Z,"Reproductive coercion is a lesser-known type of abuse. It's when someone uses pregnancy, contraception and sex to control a person. Examples vary, but can include forcing someone to have an abortion they don't want, damaging or hiding contraceptives and pressurising someone not to use condoms. To find out how common it is, the BBC commissioned a survey of 1,000 UK women aged 18-44 - and found that 50% said they had experienced at least one type of reproductive coercion. Carried out by Savanta ComRes, a third of women who completed the survey said they'd experienced pressure  - and a fifth said they'd been forced - to have sex without contraception. This is the most common form of reproductive coercion, according to the survey. One in ten women surveyed said they'd experienced someone hiding, withholding or even damaging their contraception - like poking holes in a condom on purpose. One in ten also said they'd experienced someone removing a condom during sex without consent - an act that's often called 'stealthing' - and is classed as rape under UK law. It's also a form of reproductive coercion. 'I didn't know stealthing is rape - until it happened'TikTok star 'glad' she shared sexual assault story Carly says this is something that's happened to her. ""I've had instances where I would say stealthing has happened, where there's been that pressure not to use something when I quite clearly said I wouldn't do anything without using [condoms],"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat and File on 4. Carly believes reproductive coercion is a lot more common than people realise.  ""I know a lot of people that have said their partner would make an excuse that condoms don't fit, or saying 'well that doesn't work for me - it doesn't have the same effect.'""  ""But taking something off during sex, I think sometimes men don't understand that actually that's not OK."" So did she think it was wrong at the time? ""I think when you are in that situation, you don't necessarily identify yourself as a victim, you kind of brush it off. It becomes so normalised that people don't take it seriously"". But there are other, more extreme instances of reproductive coercion, including some where women are kept continuously pregnant by their partner. That's what happened to Maeve*. She met her partner when she was a teenager and got pregnant a few months later. She says he was a ""charmer"" at first, but it wasn't long before he was controlling her - and her access to the pill. ""I'd go to the GP, and he'd come and wait in the car. I'd get a call to say 'hurry up' when I was in there,"" Maeve says. As soon as she was back in the car he'd take it from her. She says he was doing it so she was ""always pregnant"". Writing about my sexual assault was 'cathartic' Why I shared pictures of my assault online By doing this, Maeve's partner was able to control every aspect of her life - including being able to get a job. ""Every time I said I wanted to go to work or I mentioned getting a job, I wasn't allowed to take my pill,"" she says. Her partner was also physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive towards her. Maeve wants health professionals and the authorities to be more aware of this type of abuse, which is a form of coercive control. The law was changed in 2015 to make coercive control a criminal offence in the UK. Winnie Porter, 28, is a midwife specialising in women's safety at an MSI Reproductive Choices abortion and sexual health clinic, where we spoke to her. She's very used to seeing women who are being pressured into a termination, or other types of reproductive coercion. ""I hear the same things and I hear the same techniques that people are using to try and coerce women into having abortions, into not having abortions, into having contraception that they don't want."" 15% of women in our survey told us they'd experienced pressure to terminate a pregnancy when they didn't want to. Like Maeve, Winnie believes reproductive coercion is not well recognised among health professionals  ""I'd say it's almost a bit of a blind spot for a lot of services,"" she says. ""It is so subtle that it almost doesn't appear, you almost don't notice it and it's only through really kind of questioning what's going on in that woman's life when you start to understand that this very specific type of control is happening."" While we are doing the interview with her at work, she gets a knock on the door.  There's a woman in the room next to us being pressured by her partner into a termination she doesn't want. Winnie goes to chat with her and has a meeting with her colleagues. When she returns she explains what's happening. ""We're trying to determine at this point whether she's safe to go home and how she will manage the situation when she gets home.  ""Unfortunately, she's just not sure. Sometimes this is a bit of a fact-finding investigation about, is there anything else we don't know about this situation?   ""Right now, my job is just making decisions about what we do and ensuring that right now she's OK. She's safe."" Cases like this stick with Winnie when she leaves work at the end of the day. ""It's a frustration. I think it's probably the best way to describe itâ¦ just thinking I've seen it again and what can we do about it and how often are we going to keep seeing this? And when is anything going to change?"" No data is currently recorded by the NHS or Police for reproductive coercion, and it's not something most health professionals routinely ask about either. * names have been changed to protect the identity of our contributors You can listen to the full episode of File on 4's 'Controlling My Birth Control' on BBC Sounds.

British food: How traditional firms are faring under pressure,2022-03-13T08:11:30.000Z,"Brexit, Covid, the cost of living crisis and now the Ukraine war have all taken their toll on British producers and retailers. The BBC asked the businesses behind some of our best-loved foods how they have weathered the storm - and what the future holds. Within a mile-and-a-half of Billy Kevan's Stilton dairy, located amid the gentle wolds and pretty villages of the south Nottinghamshire countryside, lie three of the four farms that supply milk for his cheese. ""Two of them, we can almost see,"" he said. Stilton-making has been a way of life for these villages for generations, but Mr Kevan fears the upheavals of the past few years, in the shape of Brexit, Covid-19 and the cost of living crisis have put traditional cheesemaking under unprecedented pressures. ""We need things to settle down,"" said Mr Kevan, who is the CEO of Colston Bassett Dairy, in Nottinghamshire - one of just six businesses licensed to produce the cheese. He said Brexit had made importing materials and exporting cheese more difficult. ""It's difficult and it's on a knife-edge,"" he said. ""Since leaving the European Union, some of the red tape seems unreasonable. ""Not only do we have to get a vet certification for the cows that supply our milk, we also have to clarify whether the cows have been in the UK for a certain period of time. ""Some of our rennet comes from Scandinavia and, since we came out of Europe, we have seen prices go up."" Mr Kevan said the cost of transport and raw materials - such as milk - have also taken their toll. He and other Stilton manufacturers have expressed concern about proposals for new taxes intended to reduce salt. ""You add everything up together and it all goes on the bottom line,"" he said. ""We have had a small price rise and we are looking at another one, but if you do that you reduce sales. You are effectively caught in a catch 22."" Following Brexit, there were headlines suggesting the Melton Mowbray pork pie was under threat from foreign imports. But, according to Stephen Hallam, treasurer of the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association and brand ambassador for Dickinson and Morris, one of the Leicestershire town's most recognisable pie-makers, such stories were ""scaremongering"". ""They are perishable products with a very low price so they don't get sent around the world,"" he said. Previously protected by European law, the pies now fall under the UK Geographical Indication scheme which protects the geographic names of registered food, drink and agricultural products. ""It's not an item that's exported so if anything, moving to the British scheme will hold stronger endorsement,"" said Mr Hallam. ""It's policed in Britain and it enables members of the public to flag up infringements to Trading Standards who police it. ""It has to be made within a designated geographic area around Melton and contain a certain type of uncured pork, as well as being baked without supports."" Mr Hallam said the pandemic had had a mixed impact on the famous pie. ""Covid stopped people coming through the door. Less footfall meant lower sales,"" he said. ""But the spend went up. It made people aware of what they are eating. ""Online sales also increased during the course of the pandemic. ""The visitors are starting to come back now and Christmas is always big for us. ""In the week before Christmas, we sold 30,000 pies; in a normal week, it's 4,000."" Soaring prices across the economy have pushed production costs, Mr Hallam said, but he believes they have also helped people consider how they spend their money. ""We are seeing more people buying British and local,"" he said. ""As belts are tightened, there is a concern about provenance.  ""The price is going up because it's matching the costs - for example, the cost of power to run an oven. ""You can't not put the price up but sales haven't massively dipped."" Duncan Kirk and his wife Fay could have been forgiven for thinking they had been pitched in at the deep end when they bought one of Bakewell's oldest tart shops. ""We took the business over in December 2019,"" Mr Kirk said. ""We closed to do some refurbishment and we managed to open for one weekend before the country went into lockdown."" But Mr Kirk said the history of the Derbyshire town's tarts and puddings, which have an established place in British food culture, meant the business has proved resilient. ""The business has been here for 120 years,"" he said. ""It has a long history and it's something to be proud of. ""We had some hairy moments but this business has so much history and brand presence; it was always going to be fine."" The pandemic also strengthened the business's online presence, as the shop ships Bakewell tarts and puddings - which are made off-site - around the world. But the core of the business remains dependent on tourism - via its cafe and takeaway trade. This suffered during the pandemic, although Mr Kirk said the relaxation of restrictions over the summer periods proved invaluable. ""In the summer months, we were open and domestic tourism was really strong,"" he said. ""The pandemic would have been much worse had we been closed."" A Defra spokesperson said: ""British food and drink, including Stilton cheese, is recognised worldwide for its taste and exceptional quality. ""Both Blue and White Stilton are protected as a Protected Designation of Origin, and their specific methods of production are essential to their identity. ""We are clear in our commitment to support our exceptional British food and drink producers, and protecting and enhancing the nation's health and natural environment for generations to come.""

Cancer: 'I thought I had Covid but it was terminal lung cancer',2022-03-14T11:51:25.000Z,"Thinking she had coronavirus, Julie Smith took four Covid tests because she had been suffering with a persistent cough and had lost her sense of taste. The grandmother went to her GP after returning from a family holiday to Butlins - but tests showed Julie actually had terminal lung cancer.  ""From 'you're not ill' and then to be diagnosed with all this, I just can't believe it,"" said the 73-year-old. Doctors now want targeted screening in Wales to catch lung cancer cases early. Trials show it can reduce deaths by 20% and one leading cancer charity has said Wales was ""lagging far behind England"" because the NHS in England has offered lung health checks in some areas since 2019.  Artificial intelligence finds lung cancerWoman with incurable cancer had treatment delayedLonger waiting times put cancer patients at risk It is being considered by the Welsh government, although lung cancer screening has not been recommended by the UK National Screening Committee. But consultants in Wales think it could save people like Julie. And if Julie, who stopped smoking in 1989, was in one of those areas in England, she would have been eligible for a scan which might have saved her life. ""We went to Butlins with the family, I went on the big water slide and everything and then the cough started,"" said the grandmother-of-four from Pontypridd, in Rhondda Cynon Taf. ""I had nothing wrong with me apart from a cough and then a couple of weeks later my taste started to go. I'd had all my Covid injections so I thought 'well I'll be alright, but I'll just have Covid'."" Julie had started to cough in September 2021 after a break in Minehead, but her Covid tests came back clear. The retired hospital housekeeper went to the doctors after neighbours heard her persistent cough during the night through the walls of their terraced house. After further scans, Julie's lung cancer was diagnosed - but it had spread to her lymph nodes and bones so treatment to cure it was no longer possible. ""I had a little tear but was in shock,"" Julie said, recalling receiving her diagnoses.  ""My husband was sobbing, as were my son and daughter. But I've had a lot of tears since."" She added: ""None of us can believe it."" The diagnosis came just four months after her ex-husband, and the father of her two children, had died of lung cancer. Julie has had chemotherapy and is now undergoing immunotherapy - treatment which uses the immune system to help fight the cancer - in an effort to prolong her life. ""I worry about the children and how they're all going to cope,"" Julie added. ""It's been so frightening, I just only hope with immunotherapy that I will have a lot longer."" Other cancers have a better survival rate because they are usually picked up earlier, but often lung cancer symptoms don't develop until the cancer has advanced. Julie is now backing calls for targeted lung screening in Wales so other families do not have to go through what her family is going through. ""What was frightening is that I had no symptoms,"" she said. ""I had nothing wrong with me except this cough. You just don't know you've got it so screening would be brilliant."" Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death around the world, with 2.1 million people diagnosed in 2020 and 1.8 million deaths. It is also the biggest cause of cancer deaths in the UK, killing more than 35,000 people a year - about a fifth of all UK cancer deaths. Experts say the most dangerous thing about lung cancer is patients often do not have symptoms until it is too late to be cured. Source: Cancer Research UK There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer but they do develop as the condition worsens. The main symptoms of lung cancer include a cough that does not go away after two or three weeks and gets worse, reoccurring chest infections, aches or pain when breathing or coughing and persistent breathlessness and tiredness. Source: NHS Screening is available in 23 areas of England to people aged between 55 and 74 who smoke, or have smoked. One leading cancer charity has criticised the Welsh government for not starting a pilot in Wales already.  ""In Wales, we are yet to get off the ground,"" said Tenovus Cancer Care chief executive Judi Rhys. ""Even though we have the go-ahead for an operational pilot, that's not going to start until later this year. We are lagging far behind England"". Jo Shoba said she owed her life to screening after stage one lung cancer was detected during a health check in December 2019 but is now ""cancer-free"". ""I was perfectly fit and healthy with no symptoms whatsoever, so it was very surprising,"" said the 72-year-old from Liverpool who smoked as a teenager. ""I totally owe my life to the screening. My first grandchild is now five months old and that's such a gift.""  Leading doctors believe effective screening could cut lung cancer deaths by a fifth and a pilot is currently being developed to test how a national rollout could be implemented. ""Bowel cancer and breast cancer have screening programmes and they've helped reduce deaths,"" said Sinan Eccles, Wales' clinical lead for developing lung cancer screening. ""We want to start making a dent in those lung cancer deaths in Wales by screening and curing more cases. ""We've had trials in America, and then in Europe, showing a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality, which, when you're talking about the biggest cancer killer that we've got in Wales, is huge."" Mr Eccles, a lung cancer consultant in south Wales, wants to start by developing screening pilots in deprived areas of Wales, where lung cancer cases and deaths are higher.  Although lung cancer deaths are high, doctors say developments in treatments can extend the lives of patients. ""We're seeing cancer outcomes now I would never have dreamt of five to 10 years ago,"" said Dr Mick Button, lung cancer lead at Cardiff's Velindre cancer hospital.  ""Some people are on immunotherapy for two years with their lung cancer and at the end of that they may have very little sign of cancer in their body, no symptoms and they can live for a lot longer."" The Welsh government has said that although lung cancer screening has not been recommended by the UK National Screening Committee, it is ""under consideration"" and a pilot was being developed.  ""We have invested significant sums in diagnostic equipment and are committed to improving cancer outcomes in Wales,"" said a government spokesperson. ""We have also published our plan for recovering NHS services, including cancer care, backed by nearly Â£250m of additional funding.""

The innovative surfing tech making waves,2022-03-14T00:18:49.000Z,"With more than 35 million surfers around the world, the sport is big business. The industry is increasingly turning to technology for bigger, better and safer thrills. Kiana Fores appears to be standing on a surfboard that's flying through the air almost 3ft (1m) above the waves. Moving smoothly over the water off the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu, the former professional surfer is riding on a hydrofoil surfboard, also known as a foilboard. These are surfboards that have a long carbon-fibre rod, or mast, extending downwards from their underside to two underwater wings. When the speed and momentum of the sea is sufficient, the wings (also made from carbon fibre) are pushed through the water, lifting the surfboard and its rider up into the air. In turn, many foilboards now have electric-powered propellers built into their masts, giving extra power so they be used when there are no waves. This means that the user can go surfing not just on flat seas, but even on lakes and rivers. ""Part of what got me into foiling was the fact that there weren't many women doing it,"" says Ms Fores, aged 26. ""Sometimes I catch the guys off guard, because they're like 'oh, there's a girl out here'. ""And then I think it trips them up that I can actually foil. So it's kind of exciting,"" she laughs. While hydrofoil technology has existed in boating for more than a century, it wasn't until the early 2000s that it started to make its way into surfing. Electric-powered hydrofoil surfboards or 'efoils' then arrived in 2018 when Puerto Rican firm, Lift Hydrofoils released the first that was commercially available. ""Foiling is opening up the realm of what's surfable,"" says Nick Leason, the company's chief executive.  Our biggest efoil sales, by far, are coming from people who don't live by the ocean. They're like 50-year-old women who live near lakes."" Mr Leason adds that the firm sold more than 4,000 products last year. Artificial, inland surfing facilities have been around since the late 1960s,  and to this day the aim for designers is bigger and better waves. Australian firm, Surf Lakes, is preparing to debut what it says is the biggest thing to hit the sector, literally and metaphorically. Still in the research and development stage, it has built a large test facility 20km (12 miles) inland from the Queensland coast. In the middle of a 3.6 hectare (nine-acre) man-made pool, a 1,400-ton, compressed air, steel pump goes up and down every six seconds. Powered by electricity, the pump creates 360-degree waves up to 8ft (2.4m) high, at a rate of 2,000 per hour. ""Imagine your best surfing session ever, on endless repeat,"" says Aaron Trevis, Surf Lakes' founder and chief executive. He adds that there are five rings of waves in the pool at any moment, which vary in shape as they hit different parts of the lake. ""So you can have a whole family with different surfing levels all surfing together at the same time.""  Although the company has yet to open a facility to the public, it says it now has 20 projects in development across Australia, Asia, Europe and the US. Its biggest sites will allow 200 people to surf at the same time. ""The real market is the 99% of people in the world who have never surfed,"" says Mr Trevis. ""In the next 10 years surfing could be 10 times the size the industry it is now."" He adds that Surf Lakes' system could theoretically make 15ft waves for professional surfing competitions.  Back out in the ocean, Maya Reis Gabeira from Brazil, holds the record for the highest wave successfully surfed by a woman. This was back in February 2020 when she conquered one 22.4m (73ft) high in NazarÃ©, Portugal. ""There's so much improvement with the help of technology,"" says the 34-year-old. ""Like measuring the height of waves scientifically, in real time, for world record prospects. ""And communication is also now becoming much more sophisticated between people in the water [on jet skis] and on the cliffs,"" she adds, in regard to the crews on standby to rescue professional surfers that get into difficulties. For surfers with environmental concerns, the fact that the majority of surfboards are still made from polyurethane, a type of plastic, is problematic.  A small start-up French company called Wyye, says one of the solutions is 3D-printing surfboards using bio-plastics which are made from corn starch. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Founded two years ago by friends, Sylvain Fleury and Leo Bouffier, Wyye now has eight employees, and four 3D printers running day and night at its base near Biarritz in south west France. The firm makes the boards according to each surfer's size, weight and requirements, and ships them across Europe. In the future it wants to set up other manufacturing facilities overseas, each near key surfing locations.  ""The goal is to duplicate our micro-factory model and 3D-print boards near popular surf spots around the world,"" says Leo Kerhir, Wyve's head of international business development. He adds that it currently takes an average of 20-50 hours to print a single board. ""But 3D printing technology is improving super fast. Now it's a two-week process from order to delivery, which is the same as a regular custom surfboard. And I think we can reduce that very soon.""  While shark attacks around the world remain thankfully rare, with a global average of 72 a year,  they do worry many surfers.  Nathan Garrison is one such person, after a childhood friend from his hometown Charleston, South Carolina, was attacked when he was a teenager. And then years later a neighbour of his in California was killed by a great white shark. To help prevent attacks, Mr Garrison launched a product called Sharkbanz, back in 2014. It is a small device that a surfer can wear on his or her wrist or ankle. It uses magnets to create an electromagnetic field of about 6ft that interferes with the electric field senses that a shark uses to hunt and navigate. ""It's kind of like [the human equivalent of] looking at the sun with your eyes, or shining a bright light in someone's face,"" says Mr Garrison. ""It's unpleasant for the shark and makes it want to turn away.""  Although he now sells up to 30,000 Sharkbanz per year, a report by the Western Australia government found that the technology has a 65% success rate. That is less than two thirds, and in 2016 a surfer in Florida who was wearing the device required 44 stitches after a bite. ""Like any safety device, it's never going to be 100% effective,"" says Mr Garrison. ""Sharks are wild animals. But this has been shown to at least reduce the risk. It tells a shark that you're there, and to look elsewhere for its meal."""
Deep listening: I realised we all share the same human feelings,2022-03-14T00:29:01.000Z,"""If a Muslim woman who wore the veil decided to unveil, I used to consider that she is a bad person and didn't deserve to be my friend. If I met her, I would bully her,"" says Hawraa Ibrahim Ghandour, a Lebanese Muslim. She says her views were shaped by growing up in a very religious family. Her father preferred her to make friends with people who were similar to her, and she says she took those values with her into adulthood and her work as an English teacher at secondary school. She is one of 150 people in Lebanon who took part in a deep listening project, run by the British Council in partnership with the BBC. The aim was to learn skills of empathy, silence and suspending judgement. And a year on, Hawraa has been reflecting on how it helped open up her mind. Do you ever really listen?Crossing Divides - BBC NewsDeep Listening - A way to better conversations ""I learned to listen more, not to judge but to try and understand, and to give time for the others to communicate the messages that they wanted to. Then to give feedback to check that I really understand what they want me to know.""   What she sees now as her previous fanaticism and intolerance were extended to anyone who was different.     ""I used to be against Syrian refugees in Lebanon,"" she says.""I used to think of Syrians here as not taking care of their hygiene and not living a proper Lebanese life.""  However, today she works on Tuesday afternoons at a school for Syrian refugees, despite the stunned reaction from her family. Every morning, Hawraa catches up with Mayada, a refugee nurse from Syria, while she drinks her morning coffee. They first met when Mayada was caring for Hawraa's mother, and now the two women are often in each other's homes.  Hawraa says her new relationships have helped her become more tolerant. ""In the past, maybe I did not communicate effectively with those people, or maybe I was just listening to the media which plays a role in stigmatising people. If we listen to each other, we find we have many commonalities - human feelings that we share."" However, Hawraa's friendship with Mayada doesn't prevent Hawraa from having serious hesitations about some aspects of Mayada's culture. Mayada's son is about to marry a woman who is only 16, which is not uncommon in the Syrian refugee community. ""I do accept that this is their choice,"" Hawraa says thoughtfully. ""With deep listening you understand that this person is not your enemy, even if they are behaving differently."" To celebrate 100 years of the BBC, in May the BBC World Service and the British Council will be running a virtual deep listening training programme for 1,000 young people in 100 countries.  If you would like to learn listening skills and practice with others from across the globe, you can find out more here. Mohammad, a humanitarian worker from Lebanon, was aware that he wasn't a strong listener, and that this got in the way of negotiations, a critical part of his job. ""I was that person who would always interrupt, the person who would always know what you are trying to tell me,"" he says. ""That's when I jumped in with assumptions, and then tried to validate them. Assumptions can be killers."" Not long after the training, Mohammad took a job in Mosul in Iraq, working with local authorities, NGOs and UN agencies to create a plan to manage the city's displaced people. To succeed in his new role, Mohammad had to reconcile many different parties with a host of conflicting ideas. ""Should we send displaced people home? Should we try and integrated them in the city where they are? Will they accept living in a neighbourhood with people from a different tribe?"" he says. Mohammad vividly remembers the briefing he received before he started work. As his colleague described the role and its requirements, he started to feel there was background information that he would need but that wasn't being shared.     ""Believe me, in the humanitarian sector, you need to understand the personalities of everyone involved in order to co-ordinate effectively. Who is an enabler, who is a spoiler and who is a blocker.""  At that moment, Mohammad remembered the listening training and the importance of giving someone space after they finished speaking, both as a sign of respect and to allow them to share more. After his colleague had finished speaking, he waited for a full 20 seconds.    ""In those 20 seconds I was able to gain a bit of trust and bond with her,"" he says. ""After that space our relationship somehow changed, and she shared with me her real experiences and her perception of the key characters I would need to work with."" Three months on, Mohammad credits this as empowering him to understand how the city works and make huge progress with the plans for a co-ordinated response. Ask your speaker to explain their perspective and why they feel so strongly. Listen, without interruption, putting aside judgements, counter-arguments and solutionsSummarise the core of what you have heard and check you have understood correctly, including the emotions and texture of their story. This does not mean you have to agreeAsk whether they agree with your summary. If not, ask them to explain moreContinue with this process till the speaker gives a resounding ""Yes."" They should at this point be likely to listen to your side of the story There are times, however, when Mohammad tries very hard not to use his newly acquired listening skills. ""In the aid sector, if you get really good, and are in a personal conversation, you take yourself to a very deep emotional level that you may not be prepared for,"" he says. Mohammad tells me about a conversation with a taxi driver who shared with him his experience of being whipped 18 times for the crime of driving a woman without a male companion, which was forbidden when the city was under the control of the so-called Islamic State.  ""There is a dark side to the deep listening,"" Mohammad explains thoughtfully. ""I know that at this time, it is not safe for me to have these conversations. I need to be able to detach myself from others' experience and suffering. Personally, I am not yet ready to master that emotional side."" Meanwhile for Hawraa, how does she reconcile her new beliefs with her upbringing and her father's values? Her father died a few years ago, but every Thursday Hawraa visits his grave. ""I feel he can see me from the sky, and I am satisfied that he is happy and proud,"" she says. ""The more we know people, the less we are afraid of them. The less we are prejudiced about them. Maybe he has discovered that all people are the same in their humanity."" "
Rosacea: 'Your skin doesn't define you',2022-03-14T00:33:55.000Z,"Rosacea is a common but misunderstood condition that is thought to affect millions. It is incurable, and those who have it must often endure a sustained treatment regime, restrictions on what they eat, drink and do and, in some cases, judgements or jibes from others. But a growing community and statements from high-profile sufferers have shown that they are not alone. Lex Gillies, from York, was a 21-year-old student when she was diagnosed with rosacea. ""I didn't want to do anything that would make people turn and look at me because I didn't want people to notice my skin,"" she says. The skin condition, characterised by a reddening of the face caused by dilated blood vessels with small bumps and spots, similar to acne, is common. Some reports suggest as many as one in 10 people in the UK have it. Controlling its physical appearance, through treatment and managing triggers such as alcohol, spicy food, exercise and even the sun, is one thing. Managing the impact on mental health is another. Lex, a blogger and British Skin Foundation Ambassador, has spent eight years documenting her relationship with rosacea, and says she has learned to understand and accept her skin as it is rather than treat it ""as my enemy"". ""I'd been seeing my rosacea as this thing that I'd had to battle and overcome and felt my skin was letting me down and being a traitor by allowing it to take over,"" she says. ""But actually it was my skin desperately trying to alert me to the fact something was wrong."" She has written extensively on the impact rosacea can have on people's mental health, saying ""it still isn't something that's taken seriously"". Her stance made her an unlikely ally - though not on political grounds - of MP Sir Edward Leigh, who has rosacea and recently spoke out about the abuse he receives as a result. He complained of being labelled a ""red gammon head"" and a ""ruddy-faced buffoon"". Gainsborough MP Sir Edward, who raised the abuse during a Westminster Hall debate in January, said he had learned to take comments about it ""with a pinch of salt"" but said he was worried about the impact on younger generations and the support available to them. On this point, Lex agrees, and though Sir Edward has been criticised for some of his political views, including recent remarks about Ukrainian refugees, she says his appearance should not be fuel for taunts. She has previously pointed out how a ""cruel jibe at an MP"" reflects on others who ""take those jokes to heart"". Janet Doyle, 71, from Hull, was diagnosed with the condition in her 30s and says some days she finds it hard to go outside. ""It's your face at the end of the day. It's what people see first,"" she said. ""It just makes you feel really awful, like, what's the point? It can be really depressing. Sometimes I think about not going out of the door."" 'Skin problems aren't only skin deep' MP with skin ailment called 'ruddy-faced buffoon' Jim Howe, 64, from Skegness, said he had also found it difficult to cope with the unwanted attention his appearance can bring. He described sitting outside a bar in Spain when a friend turned to him and said 'You've got a face like an alcoholic'. ""People judge you when you've got rosacea, and it can be quite depressing,"" he said. Nicola Dalby, from Ayrshire, said she first noticed the condition, which affects her cheeks, nose and forehead, in her teens and had struggled at times, fearing she would never ""grow out of having horrible skin"". However, she found comfort and support from speaking to others online. She describes a Facebook community she is part of as being a ""lifeline"" for her in recent years, giving her the opportunity to share experiences and swap advice and, importantly, helping her realise she was not ""on my own"". Access to professional psychological support for people with skin conditions is something the British Association of Dermatologists says is a ""significant problem"" with big gaps in provision in certain parts of the UK. It said there was ""a large body of evidence"" demonstrating the impact it could have on a person's mental health and quality of life. UK charity Changing Faces offers support to anyone living with a scar, mark or condition on their face or body. Chief executive Heather Blake says too often people's mental health is not taken into account, with the focus being placed on the physical impact of the condition. She says the charity can offer support for those who may be considering cosmetic procedures and will also provide counselling for those battling the mental impact ""We believe people have the right to choose how they live their life with a visible difference,"" she says. ""Our role is to signpost people to the right support. ""And whilst people with visible differences, like rosacea, continue to experience staring, negative comments and worse, we'll keep campaigning to challenge the discrimination people face because of how they look."" In January, after Sir Edward raised his concerns about provision, health minister Gillian Keegan said the government was ""committed to achieving parity between mental and physical health services"". For Lex, after 16 years of living with the condition, she says she is no longer at war with her skin, but acknowledges that ""a lot of people are too early in their journey to understand it or accept it yet"". ""My mantra is your skin doesn't define you. It's something you have to maintain but that is not who you are. You have rosacea, but you are not rosacea.""

The Muslim women learning to ride a bike in their 40s,2022-03-14T06:50:21.000Z,"""It's as easy as riding a bike"" goes the old saying. But what if you didn't learn to cycle as a child?  The humble bike is promoted as a greener form of transport in an age of climate change. But for some, it come with barriers. A group in Glasgow calling themselves the Hijabi riders is introducing cycling to Muslim women who may never have laid their palms on a set of handlebars. Many of them learned to cycle only recently. Their activities include cycling outings and learning to carry out their own repairs. They have also adapted their clothes to allow them to cycle safely while also being modest.  The cycling group started in 2016 with a handful women but has since grown to 20 members. Mahnoor Sultan Campbell, one of the originals, said she learned to ride a bike when she was 40 years old, to be able to take her children out. ""I was brought up in Pakistan. So I didn't have a bike as a child,"" she said. ""And my mum believed that girls shouldn't be riding bikes. So once I moved here and settled down, I never even thought about it.  ""It wasn't something that crossed my mind."" But when her children wanted to go for bike rides, she made it her mission in her 40th year to learn. Wheel forward to now, and Mahnoor is known as the mechanic of the group.  Her fear of getting a puncture when she first started cycling pushed her to learn basic bicycle repairs. As she quick-releases a wheel to change the inner tube she laughs, ""I am not the damsel in distress. ""Now I say come on, I'll teach you how to change a puncture so that you do it yourself and you don't have to rely on somebody else."" Mahnoor isn't alone in learning late. Rehana Saleem also started in her 40s.  ""I had no idea how to ride a bike before that,"" she said. ""It was just the kids and not having access to a bikeâ¦ I think I've definitely grown in confidence on the road where before, I would never cycle on the road in traffic at rush hour.""  She said she loves the travel freedom cycling gives her the most. Shgufta Anwar, another original member, explains that common barriers preventing women from cycling include safety, lack of confidence, health issues, the cost of buying a bike, as well as religious barriers. She said: ""I would probably say Muslim women, BAME (black, Asian, and minority ethnic) women, women of colour on top of that they've got religious barriers, they've got cultural barriers, they've got clothing barriers."" She pulls a large dress tunic from her bag. ""This is called an abayaâ¦ it's quite long, it's quite floaty, and there's quite a lot of material that would catch in various bits of the bike and would probably kill you, because you could topple over quite easily.""  But she has found solutions, including adapting clothes to not only be modest but safe too. She pulls out another item from her pannier, which she's modified herself. ""So it doesn't go all the way to the floor. So it allows me to still cover up. But I can cycle."" She says being visible on the bike as a Muslim woman encourages other women in her community to know what's possible. Whilst enjoying cycling together, the women are also passionate about protecting the planet.  Ms Anwar said: ""In terms of what we're doing to the climate, with our cars, you know, polluting it, not worrying about future generations, destroying the earth. That goes completely against our faith. ""Working on your faith and taking action against climate change, in my opinion are kind of one and the same."" The women hope to continue breaking these barriers through a business they're setting up, Women on Wheels, which will offer lessons and guided routes with a pay-what-you-can model, so money doesn't become another obstacle.

Ukraine crisis: US warns China against helping Russia,2022-03-14T19:10:02.000Z,"China will face consequences if it helps Russia evade sanctions in its invasion of Ukraine, the US says. Unnamed US officials told multiple news outlets that China had signalled willingness to provide military assistance to Russia. The Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of spreading disinformation. Russia denied asking Beijing for military help. The exchanges came before top US and Chinese officials met in Rome.   Media outlets, citing Washington officials, say that Russia has in recent days asked China specifically for military equipment, including drones. On Monday, the US warned allies that China had suggested it was open to a move to provide military and economic support, media reports said.  The report came as US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, for talks in Rome. ""Mr Sullivan raised a range of issues in US-China relations, with substantial discussion of Russia's war against Ukraine,"" a readout of the meeting said. ""They also underscored the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the United States and China."" In an earlier CNN interview, Mr Sullivan said the US was ""communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them"". ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,"" he said. He added that while the US believed China was aware that Russian leader Vladimir Putin was ""planning something"" before the invasion happened, Beijing ""may not have understood the full extent of it"". ""Because it's very possible that [Mr] Putin lied to them the same way that he lied to Europeans and others,"" Mr Sullivan said. In response, a spokesman for the foreign ministry in Beijing, Zhao Lijian, said the US had ""been spreading disinformation targeting China on the Ukraine issue, with malicious intentions"". Asked if he could clarify whether China had received a request for military help from Russia, Mr Zhao said this was ""fake news"" but did not deny it directly. He added that China's stance had always been consistent and that China was playing a constructive role in promoting talks.  President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said reports Russia had asked China for military assistance were not true.  ""Russia possesses its own independent potential to continue the operation. As we said, it is going according to plan and will be completed on time and in full,"" he said. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the US raised concerns with the Chinese delegation ""directly and very clearly"". China has so far refrained from condemning Russia for the invasion and has said Moscow's ""legitimate security concerns"" should be taken seriously. When the United Nations General Assembly voted to condemn Russia's invasion earlier this month, China was one of 35 countries that abstained. But Beijing at the same time has expressed ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine's sovereignty. It has also called for peace and has said it is ready to help end the war through diplomacy. Several countries have urged China to do more to stop Russia's invasion. The EU and US help Ukraine, China helps Russia; if that's how this goes, then it's a delineation that will make the war in Ukraine an even more consequential one.  The White House has decided to make public its claim just as President Biden's top security adviser is due to meet China's most senior diplomat. It appears to be a tactical move, to put pressure on China; presumably to either confirm or deny it.  The bigger aim could be to try to make Xi Jinping weigh up the pros and cons to his current position of what was last week called a ""rock solid"" relationship with Moscow.  Remember that it was just weeks ago, as the Winter Olympics opened in Beijing, that Presidents Xi and Putin declared a new alliance that had ""no limit"". Military aid could, clearly, be part of that.  But in the days after Russia's invasion China has condemned the UK, the US and others for giving weapons to Ukraine's military, saying they were adding ""fuel to the fire"". If the US intelligence assessment is correct and Beijing follows through on that request, then they too would be ""adding fuel"".

Ukraine war: 'No cap' on refugees under new UK visa scheme,2022-03-14T15:08:24.000Z,"There will be no limit to the number of Ukrainian refugees who can live with UK host families under a new visa scheme, the government has confirmed. It is hoped tens of thousands of displaced people will benefit from the Homes for Ukraine refugee scheme. More details will be set out later, before a website goes live for people to express an interest in helping.  Hosts will receive Â£350 a month as a ""thank you"" from the government. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC Breakfast there would be ""no cap"" on the number of people who can be supported through the scheme. ""I'm pleased that we're doing this because as a country we have a very proud record of offering sanctuary to people from wars and from conflicts,"" he added. The government has so far faced criticism - including from its own MPs - over the speed and scale of its response to the refugee crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. How to sponsor Ukrainian refugeesHow many people have fled Ukraine?Why I want to share my home with a Ukrainian refugee Under the new scheme people in the UK will be able to nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free, either in their own home or in another property, for at least six months. Hosts are not required to personally know the refugee they want to host. They will be matched with those seeking refuge in the UK after submitting a form.  Mr Javid said once refugees arrive they will be allowed to stay in the UK ""for at least three years"". They will have access to the NHS and other public services, and their children will be able to attend local schools. Local authorities will also receive Â£10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age. Applications to host refugees will be made online and both hosts and refugees will be vetted.  Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove will make a statement in Parliament later to set out further details. Asked if he might host a Ukrainian family himself, Mr Javid said it was something he and his wife were ""starting to have a conversation"" about.  ""Whatever I do at a personal level, I most certainly will be helping,"" he added. The first hosts and refugees will be matched this week, allowing the first Ukrainians to arrive in the UK through this route in about two weeks' time, the BBC's chief political correspondent Adam Fleming says. One of those hoping to help through the new scheme is Maxine Taylor, who lives alone in a four-bedroom house in Godalming, Surrey. Maxine, who is self-employed and works part-time, says the ""peace and quiet"" of her more rural home might be a better option for traumatised refugees than a busy city. But she does want more information from the government about the scheme - such as whether or not hosts will be taxed on the Â£350 monthly payment, and how the matching service will work. She also wants to make sure anyone she takes in gets the mental health support they will need after fleeing a war zone. Maxine says she's been wanting to find a way to help Ukrainians ""since day one"" of the invasion, and has felt ""frustrated"" that the government's visa schemes have been ""so slow"" to get off the ground.  My hopes to host refugees delayed by UK government ""I've just been absolutely horrified by what's going on,"" Maxine says, adding that seeing images of young women and men signing up to fight for their country has ""really touched me"". ""I just feel I'd like to do my bit... we've got to help."" Organisations such as charities andÂ churches will eventually be able to sponsor refugees, though there is no start date for this phase of the scheme yet. Homes for Ukraine is the second visa scheme the government has set up since the war broke out. The first has allowed Ukrainians with an immediate or extended family member in the UK to apply for a family visa to join them. Some 4,000 visas have so far been granted through that route, the latest Home Office figures show. The Home Office has defended requiring security checks on Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion. It says it must ensure the UK helps those in genuine need as it's seen people falsely claim to be Ukrainian. Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the UK's plans to help those fleeing Ukraine have been ""embarrassing"" compared with those of other countries. He told Good Morning Britain that people, businesses and councils were ""ready to step up"" and welcome refugees but the system to do so has been ""far too complicated"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer previously described the Home Office's response as ""too slow, too narrow, too mean"", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Home Secretary Priti Patel should be sacked for ""incompetence, indifference and sheer inhumanity"" in leading the response. The NSPCC said it had concerns about safety checks on prospective hosts through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. The children's charity said it was ""vital child protection is built into every stage of the government's and local authorities' response to this crisis"". Asked about the bombing of a maternity and children's hospital in the city of Mariupol last week, Mr Javid said Russia had made some 31 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine since its invasion. ""These are war crimes and Putin will be held responsible,"" he said. In a visit to the Hague on Monday, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would give financial and technical support to the International Criminal Court to help it investigate the situation in Ukraine. He said it was vital to ensure anyone who committed war crimes was held to account and that commanders on the ground, as well as the Kremlin, ""need to know that right now"".  Meanwhile, 21 Ukrainian children with cancer have arrived in the UK to receive NHS treatment, the health secretary said. The children have been given six-month visas to get them out of Ukraine quickly but Mr Javid told Sky News these would be extended ""to at least three years"".

The government is to send 500 portable electricity generators for use in facilities such as hospitals and shelters which have lost power following the invasion - something President Zelensky made a direct request for. Mr Johnson condemned the murders of US journalist Brent Renaud and countless innocent Ukrainians, Downing Street said.

Ukraine war: 21 children flown to UK for cancer treatment,2022-03-14T09:42:45.000Z,"A group of Ukrainian children have arrived in the UK to undergo life-saving cancer treatment on the NHS, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the 21 children would be offered the best possible care in hospitals around the country. The children and their immediate family members arrived on an urgent flight arranged by the government on Sunday after a plea from Polish officials. They will be assessed by doctors before being sent to appropriate hospitals. ""I am proud that the UK is offering life-saving medical care to these Ukrainian children, who have been forced out of their home country by the Russian invasion while undergoing medical treatment,"" Mr Javid said. ""I know that the incredible staff in the NHS will ensure they get the best possible care."" Nine medics from Southampton Children's Hospital flew to Poland to fetch the children. ""The families were so incredibly grateful and the stories they told were horrific,"" the hospital said.

Hundreds of Ukrainians have seen their treatment interrupted by the war, as Russian forces lay siege to cities and hospitals' supplies dry up. Many children have been evacuated to Poland, where the authorities appealed for help in caring for them. One paediatric oncologist in Poland told BBC News most of the children arriving at her hospital were in a life-threatening situation. Those arriving in the UK will undergo an assessment to understand their specific health needs before getting treatment at an appropriate NHS hospital, the Department of Health said. It added that the UK has already sent more than 650,000 medical items to Ukraine as part of its humanitarian response to the crisis. Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast seven flights have taken aid from the UK to Ukraine including wound care packs, equipment for intensive care and vital medicines. An eighth took off on Monday morning, he added. Â   NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the NHS would continue to work with ministers to provide both the necessary supplies and the ""crucial treatment"" the children need. ""Colleagues at paediatric hospitals around the country have gone above and beyond to help these children during their greatest hour of need,"" she added."
Hong Kong: Briton accused of jeopardising China's security,2022-03-14T05:45:06.000Z,"A British national living in the UK has been accused by police in Hong Kong of jeopardising China's national security and told he faces three years in jail. Benedict Rogers runs Hong Kong Watch, a charity which campaigns for human rights in the former British colony. But he has been informed that he faces charges of ""collusion with foreign forces"" if he ever returns there. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the threat was ""unjustifiable"". Mr Rogers said his group would not be silenced. ""We will continue to be a voice for the people of Hong Kong and those brave political prisoners who have been jailed under this authoritarian regime,"" he said. Hong Kong security law: What is it and is it worrying?Why China is bent on crushing dissent in Hong Kong Hong Kong was handed back from British to Chinese rule in 1997, at the end of a 99-year lease. Beijing agreed to govern it under ""one country, two systems"", granting the city its own legal system, limited democracy with multiple political parties and rights such as freedom of assembly and free speech. However, in 2019, mass anti-government protests turned violent. And a year later China passed a draconian law targeting secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments of up to life in prison. The authorities have clamped down hard, arresting scores of activists and opposition politicians. Hong Kong Watch said police had written to tell Mr Rogers of his offence, and that he faced jail, or a HK$100,000 (Â£9,800) fine, if he returns to the city. It is thought to be one of the first times authorities have tried to apply the legislation outside the territory. Lord Patten, the former colony's last governor, said it was a ""disgraceful example"" of China trying to stamp out freedom of expression in Hong Kong."
Ukraine war: Pregnant woman and baby die after hospital shelled,2022-03-14T11:51:31.000Z,"A pregnant woman wounded in the Russian bombing of a Ukrainian maternity hospital has died along with her baby, reports say. Images showed her on a stretcher following the air strike in Mariupol last Wednesday, in which at least three other people were killed. After the place where she was meant to give birth was attacked, she was taken to another hospital. Her baby was born by Caesarean section, but showed no signs of life. The surgeon, Timur Marin, told the Associated Press news agency that the woman's pelvis had been crushed and her hip detached. Medics said that as they were trying to save her life, she realised she was losing her baby and shouted, ""Kill me now!"" When it became clear to them that the child was stillborn, they tried to resuscitate the mother, but realised after 30 minutes that it was hopeless. Doctors said they did not have time to take the woman's name before her husband and father came to retrieve her body. That meant she did not end up in one of the mass graves being dug for victims of the Russian shelling of the city, they added. After the bombing of the hospital, Twitter removed two posts by the Russian embassy in London which claimed the attack had been faked. The embassy's tweets made unfounded claims that the hospital was not operational at the time and that injured women pictured at the scene were actors. The embassy also cast aspersions on another pregnant woman, photographed escaping from the wreckage of the hospital, who gave birth the day after the bombing. The image of Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied, descending rubble-strewn steps was widely shared amid outrage at the attack. In response to assertions that she was not actually pregnant, the BBC's disinformation team found evidence that contradicted the allegations.

Ukraine: Eight arrests at oligarch's London mansion after balcony protest,2022-03-14T21:21:13.000Z,"A demonstration at a mansion linked to Vladimir Putin ally Oleg Deripaska has ended with eight arrests, police said. Protesters occupied the balcony of 5 Belgrave Square, in central London, about midnight, and stayed most of the day, despite police efforts to remove them. The squatters said they were reclaiming the property for Ukrainian refugees. Just before 20:00 GMT the Met tweeted the protests were over and that eight people had been arrested in total. A spokesman said four were arrested inside the building, and four more outside. Police said they have searched the property and are satisfied there is no-one left inside, although a presence will be kept at the scene overnight. Billionaire energy tycoon Mr Deripaska is one of the oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A Met Police spokesman said four arrests were made about 18:00 GMT, for trespass, after protesters had tried to climb the back of the building, which is the Romanian consulate. Earlier in the day riot police had entered and searched the property but found nobody inside.  Four people remained on the balcony, despite police negotiators' attempts to talk them down, and the spokesman said they would be monitored overnight. The group called themselves the London Makhnovists, after the Ukrainian anarchist Nestor Makhno, who revolted against the Russian White Army in 1918-21. Standing on the balcony, one of the protesters told journalists they were doing the government's work for them by reclaiming the building for refugees fleeing their homes. He said: ""[Home secretary] Priti Patel, don't worry, we did your job - we did the housing, just send them here, we did the housing. Refugees welcome! ""We're demanding this property belong to Ukrainian refugees. Their houses have been destroyed and this guy [Deripaska] supported the war."" The group said there were about 200 rooms in the ""ridiculous"" mansion, which was ""filthy fancy"" and had ""so much stuff a normal human being would never need"", including a home cinema and works of art. ""It is massive,"" one of the protesters said. ""I got lost I don't know how many times. There are so many unnecessary rooms."" Another added: ""[Michael Gove] said oligarchs' homes should be expropriated to house Ukrainian refugees. ""We're doing the government's work for them and we're doing it for free, so I expect a significant rebate on my tax bill later on in April."" Sanctioned oligarchs' properties could be used for refugees- GoveNo cap on Ukraine refugees under UK scheme - JavidUK launches Ukraine refugee scheme site Speaking about the possibility of arrest, one said the group has ""made peace"" with the option and added ""I'm ready to take the consequences for something I believe"". In response, the prime minister's official spokesman said he thought new legislation would be needed to use seized property to house refugees. He added: ""Squatting in residential buildings is illegal, but we are working to identify the appropriate use for seized properties while owners are subject to sanctions.""  Ivan, who was passing by, said he was originally from Lviv in western Ukraine and fully supported the protest. ""I think it's very good,"" he said, adding he believed the mansion belonged to Mr Deripaska, who is ""a friend of Putin"".  ""My people are suffering and they need help,"" he said. Other passers-by were supportive of the occupation, saying they were unable to protest themselves but the action would make a difference. One man said: ""We need to protest in every way we can because this war is not right. A lot of civilians and women and children are dying every day for Putin and it's unbelievable."" Charles Delingpole, who said he works in the field of sanctions, said he supported the protest but it was important to uphold the rule of law. He said: ""I think the UK has been too slow to sanction Russian oligarchs based on an abundance of caution as opposed to due process. ""However, this is the breakdown of law and just because we fight with monsters doesn't mean we need to turn into them ourselves."" Mr Deripaska, founder of metals and hydropower company EN+, has been under US sanctions since 2018 as a result of his alleged close relationship with the Kremlin. A 2006 High Court judgement revealed Mr Deripaska was the beneficial owner of Five Belgrave Square. The seven-bedroom house, in one of London's most expensive neighbourhoods, also has a home cinema, a gym and a Turkish steam bath. The property had been bought through Ravellot Limited, an offshore company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and the business still owns the property.  Land Registry documents give Graham Bonham Carter as the contact for Ravellot.  Five bank accounts held by him are subject to asset freezing orders at the request of the National Crime Agency (NCA), following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The bank accounts were frozen because of suspected links to Mr Deripaska, the NCA said."
Cost of living: Food boss says prices could rise by up to 15%,2022-03-14T12:03:43.000Z,"A leading food industry boss has warned that prices will spike as a result of the war in Ukraine. Ronald Kers, the boss of food firm 2 Sisters, told the BBC that the cost of food could rise by up to 15% this year. He added that the price the company pays for chicken from the farm has jumped. Top UK flour producer GR Wright & Sons' has also warned its prices are ""absolutely certain"" to rise due to the conflict. Russia and Ukraine are some of the world's biggest suppliers of wheat and exports are expected to be affected by the war. In addition, the price of gas - which is used to heat greenhouses and to make fertiliser, which is essential to food production - has soared. War in the region is likely to exacerbate prices that were already increasing during what has been described as a cost of living crisis, according to some experts.  2 Sisters employs more than 14,000 people in the UK and specialises in poultry and chilled foods. Its chief executive told the BBC's Today programme that it had already been forced to pay 50% more for chicken it receives from farms. Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'Farmers warn Ukraine war will hit UK food prices He suggested that if the war continues for months, ""fundamentally it means as a country we may need to start importing less and producing more ourselves"". ""We need to work together with all supply chain partners to find a solution... it's a very complex issue."" Mr Kers also suggested that the UK's exit from the European Union had made matters more difficult, due to a bigger administrative burden for farmers and less alignment on rules with food companies on the continent. Meanwhile, David Wright, managing director of flour milling company GR Wright & Sons', said that cost increases would ""inevitably"" be passed on to consumers.  The firm, which has over 44% of the market share for the UK's bread mixes, said it was already struggling with soaring inflation before the conflict, with costs jumping by 30% between September and December.  ""Now we have a similar increase [in price due to Ukraine], but instead of it taking four months it has taken two weeks,"" Mr Wright told BBC Breakfast.  Each lorry load of wheat the firm buys costs now costs an extra Â£2,500, he said. With the company buying around 20 loads per day, it faces paying an extra Â£1m per month to keep the business running.   Though availability will not be an issue, Mr Wright said, he is ""absolutely certain"" that consumer prices will need to rise.  ""The price is so high so quickly that if you don't put the price of flour up, businesses will go out of business - it's as simple as that,"" he added.  The comments come shortly after the National Farmers Union (NFU) warned that food production could be hit, affecting the affordability of food in the shops for years. In a letter to the government last week, it called for urgent help for farmers. ""The government must act now, with a clear signal that food security is a priority for the nation,"" the NFU said. NFU president Minette Batters also told the BBC last week that the rising cost of producing fruit, vegetables and meat could cause farmers to make less at a time when the nation needs more. ""I think the whole world has got to recognise that this is not something we've faced before, we are going to see wheat price inflation levels that have never happened,"" she said. It suggested that farmers have been absorbing costs that have gone up so far. UK feed wheat prices, for example, are already 39% up on March 2021 at Â£279.40 a tonne, according to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) Other organisations have warned that any costs passed on by food producers would hit those on the lowest incomes the hardest. Research from the Resolution Foundation think tank published on Monday suggests that the war in Ukraine could see another spike in the cost of living this autumn.  It said that inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, could reach 10% for the poorest households, whose energy and food bills make up a bigger proportion of their budgets. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, called on the chancellor to protect poorest households the ""biggest cost of living crisis Britain has faced in generations"" at his upcoming spring statement on 23 March. The jump in oil prices since the beginning of the war in Ukraine has pushed up fuel prices, and the price of unleaded petrol hit another record high in the UK at the weekend. The RAC said the average price of a litre of unleaded petrol hit 163.46p on Sunday, while diesel rose to 173.44p. However, oil prices have fallen from their highs and the AA said that ""wild"" pump prices should stabilise or fall back this week, unless the price of oil takes off again. "
"Inflation: Sports bras in, doughnuts out of cost of living measure",2022-03-14T14:57:40.000Z,"High demand for workout gear and health-conscious vegetarian options are now being used to calculate the change in the cost of living in the UK. Items such as tinned beans, boosted by a rise in plant-based diets, have also been added to the basket of goods used to measure prices. The review by the Office for National Statistics also saw pet collars added. But men's suits and doughnuts are out as homeworking shifted how we dress and snack during Covid lockdowns. The ONS said it decided to add meat-free sausages to the basket of more than 700 goods, which is used to calculate how the cost of living is changing, to reflect a boost in demand for healthier food options. It also said that the removal of a men's two-piece suit, and the addition of sports bras and crop tops, accounted for the fact that spending on formal clothes has been falling, as well as a ""heightened awareness of fitness"". ""With many people still working from home, demand for more formal clothing has continued to decrease,"" ONS head of economic statistics Sam Beckett said. Since the start of the pandemic, retailers such as Boohoo and Asos have reported a boost in sales for loungewear items such as joggers or hoodies too. In total, 19 items were added while 15 have been removed. And although the deletion of doughnuts from the basket might suggest customers are opting for healthier snacks while working-from-home, multipacks of cakes are still included in the calculation. Food boss says prices could rise by up to 15%Why are prices rising so quickly?Lockdown fashion: 'People are back in pyjamas' Other additions to the basket of goods signalled a shift in how consumers are spending during the pandemic.  Anti-bacterial wipes, as well as craft and hobby kits for adults, were included in the basket of goods for the first time. Pet collars for dogs and cats were also added ""to reflect the growth in pet accessories linked to the increase in pet ownership more generally during the pandemic"", it said. Items such as atlas books or encyclopaedias, as well as coal, are out too. The official statistics body pointed out that the sale of domestic coal will be banned in 2023 as part of the government's attempt to tackle climate change. Dropping the item this year protects the index from being affected by big swings in price as that headline approaches. The publication comes as experts point out that what has been described as the cost of living crisis could be exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine. On Monday, research from the Resolution Foundation think tank suggested that the war could see another spike in the cost of living this autumn. It said that inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, could reach 10% for the poorest households, whose energy and food bills make up a bigger proportion of their budgets. Some analysts suggested on Monday that the update to the basket of goods was ""out of touch with the everyday expenditure for the masses"". Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, said that climbing sessions, which was added this year, ""is unlikely to rank highly on the list of spending priorities among those struggling to make ends meet during the cost-of-living crisis"". ""We all have our own inflation number, and it is worth keeping tabs on your spending habits to get a better idea of the goods and services that are eating most into your budget, and where you could cut back,"" he added. With inflation at the highest rate seen in 30 years, the ONS's methodology has come under extra scrutiny because of the concern that product selections do not reflect purchases made by those on lower incomes. Poverty campaigner Jack Monroe had complained that the official way inflation is calculated fail to accurately reflect this.  The ONS has said some changes were already in the pipeline to address that.From 2024, it will use a far wider range of prices from supermarket tills, which should make it easier to work out if certain brands of pasta or beans, for example, are rising faster than others."
Petrol prices set to ease after hitting record highs,2022-03-14T18:37:22.000Z,"Petrol prices are likely to fall back from record levels due to the costs of wholesale fuel and global oil easing, UK motoring groups have said. The average price for a litre of petrol hit Â£1.63 on Sunday after rising above Â£1.60 for the first time last week. Diesel remained above Â£1.73 a litre, but the AA said ""wild"" pump prices should stabilise, unless global oil prices take off again.  But MPs were told this was a ""lull before the storm"" of more price hikes. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at financial services company Investec, said consumers ""need to get ready for what could be continued increases in fuel prices."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked oil costs to surge worldwide. Mr Piper told the Treasury Committee: ""If more stringent actions are imposed upon Russia, and five million barrels a day is truly taken out of the market, then oil prices would really have no ceiling."" He explained that the UK was roughly self-sufficient in petrol but imported much of its diesel. Two thirds of UK consumers use diesel so that it could see the biggest price increases at the pump, he said. Dr Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects, told the committee that petrol prices could rise to around Â£2.40 a litre. And that diesel prices of ""Â£2.50 - even closer to Â£3"" were ""definitely in the realms of possibility"". She said the UK could follow Germany in introducing rationing measures which have already seen BP and Shell reduce diesel wholesales to industry. ""If we need to rebuild stocks over the summer so that we have a buffer over the winter...it is industry that will need to be curtailed and that's where the first set of rationing will have to come in,"" she said. Mr Piper said the only other option was for the government to release some of its stockpiles of petrol and crude oil. ""But it'll be industry that takes the brunt of any rationing initially,"" he said. Meanwhile, the AA said filling up a typical 55-litre car tank now costs Â£89.90p on average, up from Â£68.57 a year ago. Oil prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine, with the price of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - hitting a near 14-year high at one point. However, in the past few days, the price of oil has dropped as fears that the European Union would follow the US and Canada in banning Russian oil have eased. Brent crude fell as much as 8% to trade at $103.68 per barrel on Monday. Petrol price hits new record above Â£1.60 a litreHow has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices? The RAC said drivers would have to stomach probably more rises this week, but added they ""should soon get some respite from pump prices jumping by several pence a litre every day as oil and wholesale prices appear to have settled"". ""The price hikes seen over the weekend are still a result of the oil price rise which began at the start of the month and peaked early last week at $137 a barrel,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. ""As the oil price has now fallen back, we should hopefully reach the peak and start to see prices going the other way to reflect the big drop in wholesale costs seen at the end of last week, subject to no further spikes in the barrel price this week."" The reason higher prices at the pumps are likely to remain despite falling commodity prices is due to the way retailers buy the fuel and the time lag between purchasing at a certain price and then selling it on. Yet, there is a concern some retailers might be reluctant to lower their prices for fear of being caught out if wholesale costs jump back up again. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman, said a 10.6p-a-litre slump in wholesale petrol costs on Wednesday and Thursday last week, followed by oil's fall in value, had produced ""bizarre price anomalies"". ""In one town this weekend, filling a tank at one forecourt was more than a pound cheaper than directly across the road at another,"" he said. Mr Bosdet said weekends were the busiest time for forecourts and the rush by drivers to beat further potential price increases had pushed up demand, which had actually led to even higher prices at the pumps as stations had to resupply at a faster rate. Oil prices are mainly determined by the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate, as agreements are made in dollars. Russia is the third largest oil exporter and some Western countries, for example the US and Canada, decided to halt imports from the country in response to Russia's actions. It means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to increased prices. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, so is not as dependent on Russia for the commodity supply as other European countries are and has said it plans to phase it out.  It is, however, affected by the global shifts in price. But the price of Brent crude dropped in recent days, due to reduced fears of a European ban on Russian oil, and also partly due to speculation that extra supplies could come onto the market from Iran, Venezuela and the UAE. The conflict in Ukraine has led to concerns being raised by Western nations about where they get their energy from. Energy Minister Greg Hands said the UK's transition to cleaner forms of energy production was ""an issue of national security"" and not just of decarbonisation. Speaking at an event in London, he said: ""By switching to cheaper power generated in the UK, for the UK, we will ensure that we're not dependent on any unfriendly foreign country to keep our homes warm and lit."" However, Mr Hands acknowledged that the transition to cleaner energy sources would take time, and there was still a need to invest in domestic fossil fuel production."
Rolling Stones announce first UK dates since Charlie Watts' death,2022-03-14T09:02:54.000Z,"The Rolling Stones have announced their first UK shows since the death of their drummer Charlie Watts last year. The band will play in Liverpool and London as part of their 60th anniversary tour of Europe this summer. As with their US dates last year, Watts will be replaced by Steve Jordan, a session musician who has played with guitarist Keith Richards since the 80s. Watts, who joined the band in 1963, died of an unspecified illness last August at the age of 80. When the band returned to the stage the following month, singer Mick Jagger dedicated the show to his old friend. ""We all miss Charlie so much. We miss him as a band, we miss him as friends - on and off the stage,"" he told an audience in Massachusetts. Rolling Stones resume tour without Charlie WattsRolling Stones drop Brown Sugar from US tourCharlie Watts: Jazz man who became rock superstar The Stones' 60th anniversary tour is billed simply as Sixty, and will feature new staging and production. Launching in Madrid on 1 June, it will see the band performing at the home of Liverpool FC, Anfield, for the Stones' first Liverpool show in more than 50 years. They will then head to London for two dates at the BST festival in Hyde Park, with other dates in Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Austria and France. ""Sorry to keep you all hanging around, but the waiting is over,"" said Richards as he announced the tour.  ""I've always said the best place for rock and roll is on being on stage with the Stones and this year is very special. Looking forward to rehearsing with Mick and Ronnie and some friends, the wheels are in motion. See you all very soon."" Ronnie Wood added: ""When I look out at the sea of people when we play in Europe all I can see is smiles. ""It's heart-warming and I'm glad we make people happy every time we play live.

How many Ukrainians have fled their homes and where have they gone?,2022-03-29T09:40:57.000Z,"More than ten million people have now fled their homes in Ukraine because of the Russian invasion, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says. As well as the 3.8 million who have left for neighbouring countries, another estimated 6.5 million people are thought to be displaced inside the war-torn country itself. The UN's figure is based on research carried out by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) between 9 and 16 March.  Of the 2,000 internally displaced people it surveyed: nearly 30% had come from Kyiv, more than 36% had fled from the east of Ukraine and 20% had come from the northnearly 40% were now in the west of Ukraine, with less than 3% in Kyivonly 5% had left their homes in anticipation of the invasion, with the vast majority fleeing either at the start of the war or when it reached their area The IOM estimates that more than half of the people who are internally displaced are women, and many are deemed particularly vulnerable because they are pregnant, have a disability or are a victim of violence. The UN, which is working alongside other organisations to provide help to people in Ukraine, says it is offering humanitarian assistance ""wherever necessary and possible"". This includes: giving cash to people for basics like food and rentdelivering supplies from west to east, including food and tarpaulins for homes damaged by shellingproviding folding beds to people in bomb shelterssetting up reception and transit points for internally-displaced people As well as the 6.5 million people who have left their homes, about 12 million are thought to be stranded or unable to leave areas affected by the fighting. Refugees are also crossing to neighbouring countries to the west, such as Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova.  The UN says that as of 27 March, 3.6 million people have left Ukraine: Poland has taken in 2,293,833 refugeesRomania 595,868Moldova 383,627Hungary 354,041Slovakia 275,439Russia 271,254Belarus 9,075 Some people have travelled from Moldova into Romania and so are included in both countries' totals, the UN says. Trains heading towards Ukraine's border have been packed, and there have been long queues of traffic on roads leading out of the country. Refugees don't need all their official documents, but it is helpful if they can provide provide identification cards or passports, birth certificates of children travelling with them and and medical documentation. To get refugee status, they need to be Ukrainian citizens or people legally living in Ukraine, such as foreign students. There have been reports of people from African countries being prevented from leaving Ukraine.  'They said if you're black, you should walk' In countries bordering Ukraine, refugees can stay in reception centres if they can't stay with friends or relatives. They are given food and medical care, and information about onward travel. The EU has granted Ukrainians who flee the war a blanket right to stay and work throughout its 27 member nations for up to three years.  They will also receive social welfare and access to housing, medical treatment and schools. The government of Poland, which has received the highest number of refugees, has said it will need more money than the EU is currently offering in order to host the number of people arriving there. Moldova, which has by far the largest concentration of refugees per capita, has also appealed for international help in dealing with the numbers arriving. Couple hire hotel in Poland to house refugeesPoland feels the strain of Ukraine's refugees  The UK launched a family visa scheme for Ukrainians who have an immediate or extended family member in the UK. As of 27 March, 21,600 UK visas had been issued.  After the UK government was criticised for the speed and scale of its response, it also launched the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  Under this, people in the UK can nominate an individual or family to stay with them rent-free for at least six months. Refugees who come via the scheme will be able to live and work in the UK for up to three years, and access healthcare, welfare and schools. Applications are made online, and both hosts and refugees will be vetted. Hosts will receive Â£350 a month and there will be no cap on the numbers able to come to the UK.  However, some families who have applied to be sponsors have complained that the system is too slow and complicated.

Ed Sheeran copyright trial: Songwriter says he 'feels robbed',2022-03-14T15:43:09.000Z,"Ed Sheeran ""belittled"" a songwriter who accused him of stealing one of his songs, London's High Court has heard. Sami Chokri says he was hurt by the tone of Sheeran's lawyers' emails after he noticed similarities between his song Oh Why and Sheeran's Shape Of You. ""I feel like I've been robbed by someone I respect, or respected,"" he told the court. ""This is years of a cloud over my head. All I heard and read was emails belittling me and my questions."" He continued: ""All I wanted to do was ask for an explanation. If I'd had one we wouldn't have had to go through with this rubbish."" He later called the trial ""the most horrible few weeks of my life"". Mr Chokri, who performs under the name Sami Switch, says the ""oh I, oh I, oh I,"" hook on Shape Of You is ""strikingly similar"" to the chorus of his song, which was released two years earlier. In a witness statement, he said he first became aware of the alleged plagiarism in 2017. ""I was a passenger in my girlfriend's car and Shape Of You came on the radio,"" he wrote. ""She and I were both shocked to hear the similarities. Mr Chokri later put out a Facebook post saying, ""Anyone else think Ed Sheeran's new song Shape Of You chorus sounds familiar lol?""  ""I had lots of responses,"" he said, including one from Sheeran's friend Jamal Edwards featuring the ""shifty eyes"" emoji - which was later deleted. ""I thought maybe he had played a part in showing [my song] to Ed,"" Mr Chokri told the court. ""I had no reason to ever consider it coming to circumstances like these."" Before his death last month, Mr Edwards gave a written statement in which he denied playing Oh Why to Sheeran. ""Even if I was sent a copy, I did not share it with Ed,"" he wrote. ""I respect what Jamal says,"" Mr Chokri responded in court, ""but I also believe that Jamal would share music with Ed Sheeran."" Sheeran and his co-writers Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac have all denied copying Oh Why.  Last week, Sheeran told the court that the contested element of Shape of You was ""very short"", and the relevant parts of both songs were ""entirely commonplace"". He added: ""Even so, if I had heard Oh Why at the time and had referenced it, I would have taken steps to clear it. ""I have been as scrupulous as I possibly can and have even given credits to people who I believe may have been no more than a mere influence for a songwriting element. This is because I want to treat other songwriters fairly."" Giving evidence on Monday, Mr Chokri disputed the star's claim, saying: ""I believe Ed Sheeran heard it, that's my truth."" Asked if he was accusing the star of lying under oath, he responded: ""I'm not sure if he lied or he doesn't remember."" In his witness statement, Mr Chokri said he had written Oh Why in June 2014 at a time when he was ""truly in pain"". ""I remember specifically that I was drinking some wine that day whilst we were writing and recording,"" he wrote. ""I was saying, 'Why do I keep putting myself back in this place?' ""I recall singing to Ross [O'Donoghue, his co-writer], 'Oh why, Oh why, Oh why?' and Ross saying something along the lines of, 'That's It! Let's work on that'.  ""The song really resonated because it was a little bit different to anything else that I had made."" Mr Chokri later tried to get Sheeran to listen to the song ""as I was inspired by his success and stardom and his endorsement would be a significant boost"". To increase his chances, he sent an EP that included Oh Why to several people in Sheeran's circle, including producer Adam Coltman, musician Jake Roche and Jamal Edwards. Giving evidence, Mr Chokri said he was certain that one of them would have played it to the star - but ""I can't tell you exactly which because I don't know"". Ian Mill QC, representing Sheeran, suggested that Oh Why was itself inspired by Ed Sheeran's cover of the Johnny Cash song The Wayfaring Stranger. ""I doubt it,"" replied Mr Chokri. ""That was a life-changing day for me. I wasn't thinking about Ed Sheeran, I was thinking about staying alive."" He acknowledged being a fan of Mr Sheeran's work, and The Wayfaring Stranger in particular. ""I definitely appreciated his work,"" he said, ""but I've got a bitter taste in my mouth since he stole a part of my song."" Mr Chokri and Mr O'Donoghue first accused Sheeran and his copying their song in 2018. The trio denied the claims and launched legal proceedings in May 2018, asking the High Court to declare they had not infringed any copyright. Several months later, Mr Chokri and Mr O'Donoghue issued their own claim for ""copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement"". In court, Sheeran's lawyer noted that Mr Chokri had not registered Oh Why with music rights body the PRS until April 2017 - three months after Shape Of You was released. ""The fact you weren't registered is indicative of the fact you weren't earning money"" from the song, he said. ""My main focus... was to get my name out there,"" replied Mr Chokri. ""I didn't think about money at all."" Mr Mill suggested the real reason for registering the song was so Mr Chokri could pursue his copyright claim. ""I was advised that would be the next step,"" he told the court, but ""didn't know that signing up to PRS was for that purpose"". An estimated Â£20m in royalty payments has been frozen since that point. The trial continues. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Mass graves in Ukraine: Battered cities are digging makeshift burial sites,2022-03-14T12:25:35.000Z,"The Russian bombardment of some places in Ukraine is so intense that towns and cities are being forced to unceremoniously bury dozens of civilian victims in mass graves. Nowhere is this grim reality of war more apparent than in Mariupol, a key port city devastated by constant shelling, where several burial sites have been hastily dug in the past two weeks. ""We can't bury [the victims] in private graves, as those are outside the city and the perimeter is controlled by Russian troops,"" Mariupol's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC by phone. Locations include a retired city cemetery that has now been re-opened, Mr Orlov said. Warning: This article contains images that some may find upsetting On Sunday, the city council said the civilian death toll had risen above 2,100. The heavy Russian shelling has prevented any mass evacuation from Mariupol, despite efforts to open a safe exit route. Mr Orlov could not give a total for dead civilians buried in mass graves, but said 67 bodies were at one site. ""Some we can't identify but some had documents.""  Thousands of residents are hiding in cellars and in some cases, he said, people are burying family members privately in courtyards or gardens. The battered city's street cleaners and road repair teams were collecting bodies in the streets, he said, as municipal services had collapsed. ""Some people were killed during those collections. We've had no electricity, or heating, sanitation, water, food for 11 days,"" he said. Four-hundred miles to the north west, on the edge of the capital Kyiv, a mass grave was dug near a church in the town of Bucha, local MP Mykhailyna Skoryk-Shkarivska said. It contains more than 60 bodies. Video of the burial was posted on Facebook by a doctor working in nearby Irpin, Andriy Levkivsky. Doctors buried the victims, who had been brought to Irpin hospital.  Ms Skoryk-Shkarivska told the BBC that a ""ritual service"" was conducted at the hospital before burial. Not all had been identified and ""nobody knows exactly where the relatives are,"" she said.  ""Now we're discussing with volunteers how to create a digital system to identify people and trace missing relatives,"" she said.  Russian troops captured the hospital on Saturday and told the doctors to leave, she said, speaking by phone from western Ukraine. Bucha and half of Irpin are now in Russian hands, she said.  The return of mass graves is a shock for Ukrainians. Many have bitter family memories of World War Two, when Jews and Soviet partisans were murdered by Nazis, and the Holodomor - the famine created in Ukraine by Soviet seizure of grain and livestock in the 1930s. ""My uncle is 92 and even he compared it with his childhood in the war,"" said Ms Skoryk-Shkarivska, who emphasised it is ""important for us to bury relatives traditionally, the Christian way, with praying"".  ""Even now in war people sometimes ask priests to do that,"" she said. In northern Ukraine the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy are surrounded by Russian troops and relentless shelling has killed many civilians there too.  On 6 March Oleksandra Matviichuk, a civil liberties campaigner, tweeted a photo of coffins in a trench, accompanied by the message: ""Thus, civilians killed in the Russian bombing of Chernihiv are buried in trenches. Since the main city cemetery in Yatsevo is under constant shelling by the Russian occupiers, the victims are buried in the Yalivshchyna forest.""  Oleksandr Lomako, secretary of Chernihiv city council, told the BBC that victims of Russian air raids and shelling were being buried in a temporary cemetery. He confirmed that the city's main cemetery was now inaccessible, with Russian troops surrounding the city on three sides, the nearest about 10km (six miles) away. ""After the war we will rebury the dead,"" he said, estimating the city's civilian death toll in the Russian bombardment to be about 200.  One air raid killed 45 people in Chernihiv - the worst toll, Mr Lomako said - adding that nightly bombing was killing seven civilians on average. ""The planes drop three to four bombs on residential blocks. Also one hit the hospital, but it is still working. Dozens of housing blocks have been destroyed on the edge of the city."" As well as evidence of mass burials, there are accounts of makeshift graves.  A mother and son were buried in the courtyard of their new apartment block in Irpin, which has been heavily shelled by the Russians. A photo of the grave was widely shared by Ukrainians, and a tweet by journalist Olga Rudenko showed Marina Met and her son Ivan enjoying life in Kyiv before the invasion.  For those whose loved ones have suffered the effects of siege and shelling at the hands of invading forces, burial in makeshift graves will no doubt feel like the final indignity.

The Prince of Wales and Boris Johnson were among those at the Westminster Abbey service, with the prime minister wearing a Ukraine-and-UK badge. ""It is not the first time that might has demanded to be right,"" Lord Sentamu said of the attack on Ukraine. The Queen, 95, had pulled out of attending this year's service. Lord Sentamu told the Commonwealth Service, attended by royals including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and senior politicians, his prayer for Ukraine was ""heavenly justice will defend the poor and vulnerable"". In contrast to a ""world which measures power in megatons"", he said, the Queen's long reign had been about duty and service and the principle: ""Whoever shall be great among you shall be your servant.""  The Royal Family have been unusually outspoken over the Ukraine war, with Prince Charles condemning the ""brutal aggression"" and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visiting the Ukrainian Cultural Centre wearing badges in the Ukrainian national colours.

The ceremony, in Westminster Abbey, celebrated the work of the Commonwealth, with parades of flags, readings and music from Emeli SandÃ© and Mica Paris, and a focus on the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. After concerns about her ability to travel and her mobility, the Queen had been unable to attend in person.  But in a message she praised the Commonwealth as a force for good in ""these testing times"". She also showed no sign of stepping back, repeating the lifelong commitment made when she was 21 that ""my life will always be devoted in service"". The Queen recently recovered from Covid and has returned to holding diplomatic meetings and audiences in person.  But in one of those meetings last month, she said: ""As you can see, I can't move.""

How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees?,2022-03-18T17:49:36.000Z,"The government has launched its ""Homes for Ukraine"" scheme, which will let people in the UK host refugees in their homes.  It says tens of thousands of people fleeing the war in Ukraine could come to the UK through this route. The scheme will cover Ukrainian refugees who don't have family ties here.  Anyone in the UK - of any nationality, providing they have at least six months leave to remain in the UK - can apply to be a host through the government website.  You have to be able to host the refugees in your own home or in another property, for at least six months.    Charities, businesses and community groups will also be able to apply. Those offering to house refugees will be vetted by the government, and Ukrainian applicants will also undergo security checks before being matched with a host. There will be more detailed guidance on the checks in the coming days.  The government says there will be no cap or upper limit on the number of Ukrainians who can come under the scheme.  Almost 90,000 people signed up to be a host within the first day.  In the ""first phase"" of the scheme, people will need the name of a Ukrainian individual or family they wish to sponsor. The government advises them to ""get in contact with them directly and prepare to fill in a visa application with all their details and yours"". The process started on 18 March via the visa application form on the government website. Refugees with a valid Ukrainian international passport can apply online, but those without one will have to go to a Visa Application Centre. These are operating in European countries, including those bordering Ukraine such as Poland. Those who don't personally know anyone fleeing Ukraine, can register their interest on the government's website.  They are also advised to get in touch with charities, faith groups or local community organisations who are starting to make connections between individuals.  Charities which work in this area include: Refugees at Home, a charity connecting refugees and hosts onlineRoom for Refugees, which has previously settled unaccompanied child refugees with families in the UKShelter 4 Ukraine, a Ukrainian-run service which registers hosts and refugeesReset, which has run a community sponsorship scheme for refugees since 2018  Host households in the UK will be offered a tax-free payment of Â£350 a month for up to 12 months, regardless of how many individuals they support.  Only one payment can be made per residential address.  The government website says hosts ""will not be expected to cover the costs of food and living expenses (although you may wish to offer this yourself)"". Local authorities will also receive Â£10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services, with additional money available for children of school age. There will be more details on the role of local councils in providing wider support in the coming days.  Any Ukrainian national, or the immediate family member of a Ukrainian national, who was resident in Ukraine prior to 1 January 2022, will be able to apply to come to the UK. Those who are granted a visa under the scheme will be eligible to work, and can access state benefits and public services for three years. Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer and Morrisons are among UK retailers who have offered to employ Ukrainian refugees. The government has also said it will look at options to provide support to Ukrainian nationals who want to come to the UK with their pets.

Ukraine war: Editor interrupts Russian TV news show,2022-03-14T22:09:03.000Z,"A woman holding an anti-war sign ran on to the set of a Russian evening news programme on the state-controlled Channel 1 on Monday evening.  The sign, clearly visible behind the presenter, read: ""No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here."" The woman has been named as Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at the channel.  Russian TV news is tightly controlled by the Kremlin and reflects only the Russian version of events in Ukraine.  Ms Ovsyannikova is believed to be in police custody. Her voice could be heard during the broadcast saying, ""No to war! Stop the war!"" before the programme director cut early to a recorded news report. Before the protest, which happened live on the nightly news programme, she recorded a video in which she called events in Ukraine a ""crime"" and said she was ashamed to work for what she called Kremlin propaganda.  ""I'm ashamed that I allowed myself to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed Russians to be turned into zombies,"" she explained.  She called on the Russian people to protest against the war, saying that only they could ""stop the madness"".  From the moment Ms Ovsyannikova's identity became known, she has received dozens of comments on her Facebook page in Ukrainian, Russian and English, thanking her for her actions.  Russian television news has long been controlled by the Kremlin and independent viewpoints are rare on all the major channels.  But new laws introduced since the invasion of Ukraine have made the media landscape even more draconian. Legislation passed earlier this month made it illegal to call the military action an ""invasion"" or to disseminate ""fake"" news about it.  State-controlled Russian media refer to the war as a ""special military operation"" and paint Ukraine as the aggressor, with a government described as neo-Nazi.  Several of the remaining independent media outlets have stopped broadcasting or publishing after pressure from the authorities, including the radio station Echo of Moscow and TV Rain - an online TV channel.  Others, like newspaper Novaya Gazeta, are attempting to report on the situation without falling foul of the new censorship laws.

Russia's media watchdog accused the BBC and other foreign broadcasters of the ""deliberate and systematic circulation of materials containing false information"". Many social media sites have also been blocked, further restricting the number and diversity of news sources available to people inside Russia.  Facebook and Twitter have been restricted for several days, while Instagram - which is particularly popular in Russia - was blocked on Monday, although many Russians have found ways round the restrictions."
Homes for Ukraine refugee scheme launches in UK,2022-03-15T14:16:55.000Z,"The government has launched its Homes for Ukraine site for those wanting to host a refugee, with 100,000 signing up within the first day. Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove said the UK had a history of ""supporting the most vulnerable during their darkest hours"".  He said there would be no limit to how many Ukrainians could enter the UK under the visa sponsorship scheme. Each household housing a refugee will be offered Â£350 a month, tax-free. They will not be expected to provide food and living expenses but can choose to offer this. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""fantastic"" that more than 100,000 people and organisations had expressed interest in supporting Ukrainians. ""Thank you to everyone across the country who has stepped up to offer their help so far,"" he tweeted. People who wish to offer a rent-free space in their home or a separate residence, for at least six months, can register their interest online. They will be able to individually sponsor a Ukrainian national's visa from Friday. Those initial applications will rely on the applicant knowing a named individual from Ukraine they want to help. But Ukrainian refugees with no family or other links to the UK can and will be hosted as part of the scheme, Mr Gove said.  He said the sponsorship scheme was initially only between people who are already known to each other so it gets ""up and running as soon as possible"". The scheme will be expanded with the support of charities, community groups and churches who can help with matching refugees to hosts.  No timescale has been announced for when this will happen but Mr Gove said it would expand ""rapidly"".  How to sponsor Ukrainian refugeesHow does the UK's visa scheme for Ukrainians work?How many have fled Ukraine - and where are they going?The refugee host family with 'all the love to give' The government has faced criticism - including from its own MPs - over the speed and scale of its response to the refugee crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Almost three million people have fled Ukraine since Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian invasion nearly three weeks ago.  Mr Gove had said the scheme was open to nationals and residents of Ukraine, but his department later clarified that those eligible were Ukrainian nationals and immediate family members who had been resident prior to 1 January.  LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyKYIV: Ukraine generals on why Kyiv will not fall easilyIMPACT: One shell that destroyed a familyWATCH: Five times refugees were met with kindnessIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict As part of the scheme, refugees will have access to the NHS and other public services. Their children will be able to attend local schools. Local authorities will also receive Â£10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age. Mr Gove said everyone in the UK was ""in awe of the bravery of the people of Ukraine"".  ""The victims of savage, indiscriminate, unprovoked aggression, their courage under fire and their determination to resist inspires our total admiration,"" he said.  Both hosts and refugees taking part in Homes for Ukraine will be vetted. In addition, local councils will check that the accommodation offered is suitable, the government said. A Department for Education source told the BBC the government was planning for a capacity of around 100,000 school-age Ukrainian children to be placed in UK schools and said they were confident the school system could cope. Shadow housing and communities secretary Lisa Nandy said Labour was concerned about ""the lack of urgency"" and added that the visa application process could be simplified.  She said: ""We could keep essential checks but drop the excessive bureaucracy."" One person putting her name forward is Mandi Arnold, who lives in Shropshire with her partner and three children. Mandi, 35, says life in her house is already hectic and so ""it might as well be even busier"" with an extra couple of people. ""I would love to welcome someone in my home to give them that security and love,"" she says. ""I've got a lot of love to give and it's the perfect opportunity to give it to someone who's in need."" Mandi says her two sons are too young to understand what housing a refugee would involve but that she and her husband have chatted to her nine-year-old daughter, Amalia, about it. Husband and wife team Mandy and Mark Durrell were also among the first to register to offer a room. The Methodist ministers from Bangor said watching the news from Ukraine had been heartbreaking. ""We want to offer space, companionship, comfort and safety,"" said Mark. ""We have this home. There's two of us and the dog - and there's space here to give someone refuge and sanctuary.""   Read more Refugees at Home, which finds host families for refugees and asylum seekers, said it wanted to see ""as many refugees housed as soon as possible"". Its executive director Lauren Scott stressed that home visits should take place before a placement is made and called for follow-up support to be offered to hosts and guests alike.  There should also be plans for what happens ""for the rare situations in which a placement does not work out"", she added.  All that should be done quickly and also ""in a thoughtful, sensitive and thought-through way"".  Iryna Terlecky, a board member of the Associations of Ukrainians in Great Britain and chair of the Association of Ukrainian Women, praised the British public's response to the scheme but she told the Today programme Â£10,500 per refugee ""may well not be enough"" for local authorities. ""What we want to see is that local authorities have the right level of funding so that they can continue to support, not only the families coming over but also their sponsors.  ""For a six-month commitment there will be times when for whatever reason it doesn't work out and local authorities and the established charities and the Ukrainian community need to be there to help in those circumstances."" Homes for Ukraine is the second visa scheme the government has set up since the war broke out. The first has allowed Ukrainians with an immediate or extended family member in the UK to apply for a family visa to join them. Ukrainian passport holders no longer have to attend in-person appointments at visa application centres to submit their fingerprints and facial recognition, the Home Office said, with applicants now able to fill out forms online before giving their biometrics on arrival in the UK. Some 4,600 visas have so far been granted through that route, the latest Home Office figures show. The Home Office has defended requiring security checks on Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion. It says it must ensure the UK helps those in genuine need as it has seen people falsely claim to be Ukrainian. Have you signed up for the Homes for Ukraine scheme? Email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

"All UK travel rules to end on Friday, says government",2022-03-14T20:05:56.000Z,"The transport secretary has confirmed that all remaining Covid travel measures will be scrapped. Currently, everyone travelling to the UK must complete a passenger locator form before they arrive.  Travellers who are not fully vaccinated have to take a Covid test before departure, fill in the form, and book and pay for a PCR test after arriving.   Grant Shapps confirmed in a tweet that these rules will end at 04:00 on Friday. His announcement means that passengers who are not fully vaccinated will no longer have to take Covid tests before and after travelling to the UK. The passenger locator form will no longer be necessary either. People planning an overseas trip will still need to be aware of other countries' entry rules.  Mr Shapps tweeted: ""These changes are possible due to our vaccine rollout and mean greater freedom in time for Easter."" When any new Covid strains appear in the future, the government said its default approach would be to use ""the least-stringent measures"" for restricting travel. Its ""Living with Covid"" plan said new measures at the border would only be considered in ""extreme circumstances"".   It said the UKHSA would closely monitor the prevalence and spread of Covid variants. What are the UK's 'Living with Covid' plans?  Scotland and Wales have agreed to follow England in scrapping the remaining coronavirus border measures. But Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she was doing so ""reluctantly"" - and was ""extremely disappointed"" that testing requirements and the passenger location form were being ditched. The Scottish government said consistency across the four nations was agreed because of the ""negative impact of non-alignment on the tourism industry"". Testing requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals into the UK were dropped in February.  The latest move was welcomed by some figures in the travel industry, which has campaigned for the remaining rules to be dropped so businesses can take full advantage of strong summer holiday demand. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said: ""Today's announcement sends a clear message to the world - the UK travel sector is back.  ""With travellers returning to the UK no longer burdened by unnecessary forms and testing requirements, we can now look forward to the return to pre-Covid normality throughout the travel experience."" A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: ""The removal of all remaining UK travel restrictions is the final important step towards frictionless air travel, helping to further restore consumer confidence as we welcome more customers back to the skies this spring and summer.  ""To uphold the experience of all travellers, it's vital that the UK Government works closely with industry to ensure the UK border is ready for increasing passengers, as international travel ramps up."" Meanwhile, Eurostar's chief executive Jacques Damas said the easing of restrictions would help the cross-Channel train operator's recovery. ""We hope and expect to see the UK's approach replicated across our other markets in the coming weeks,"" Mr Damas said. However, as Covid restrictions recede, other headwinds for the aviation industry are appearing. The price of jet fuel has soared as a result of higher crude oil prices. This adds to cost pressures on airlines, although some have been protected by their hedging strategies, whereby they purchased fuel in advance at lower prices. On Friday, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, John Holland-Kaye, said the recovery of aviation remained ""overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty"". Businesses will also be keeping a careful eye on whether consumers' confidence to book is knocked by the war in Ukraine and rising household bills squeezing disposable incomes.  Air France-KLM and Ryanair have both recently warned air fares will rise."
Roman Abramovich: New evidence highlights corrupt deals,2022-03-14T17:01:57.000Z,"A BBC investigation has uncovered new evidence about the corrupt deals that made Roman Abramovich's fortune. The Chelsea owner made billions after buying an oil company from the Russian government in a rigged auction in 1995. Mr Abramovich paid around $250m (Â£190m) for Sibneft, before selling it back to the Russian government for $13bn in 2005. His lawyers say there is no basis for alleging he has amassed very substantial wealth through criminality. The Russian billionaire was sanctioned by the UK government last week because of his links to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Abramovich's assets have been frozen and he has been disqualified as a director of Chelsea Football Club. What do sanctions mean for Chelsea?Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? The Russian billionaire has already admitted in a UK court that he made corrupt payments to help get the Sibneft deal off the ground. He was being sued in London by his former business associate Boris Berezovsky in 2012. Mr Abramovich won the case, but he described in court how the original Sibneft auction was rigged in his favour and how he gave Mr Berezovsky $10m to pay off a Kremlin official. BBC Panorama has obtained a document that is thought to have been smuggled out of Russia. The information was given to the programme by a confidential source, who says it was secretly copied from files held on Mr Abramovich by Russian law enforcement agencies. The BBC cannot verify that, but checks with other sources in Russia have backed up many of the details in the five-page document. The document says that the Russian government was cheated out of $2.7bn in the Sibneft deal - a claim supported by a 1997 Russian parliamentary investigation. The document also says that the Russian authorities wanted to charge Mr Abramovich with fraud. It says: ""The Dept. of Economic Crimes investigators came to the conclusion that if Abramovich could be brought to trial he would have faced accusations of fraudâ¦ by an organised criminal group."" Watch Panorama Roman Abramovich's Dirty Money is on BBC One, Monday 14 March, at 20:00 GMT and on BBCiPlayer afterwards Panorama tracked down Russia's former chief prosecutor, who investigated the deal in the 1990s.  Yuri Skuratov did not know about the secret document, but he independently confirmed many of the details about the Sibneft sale. Mr Skuratov told the programme: ""Basically, it was a fraudulent scheme, where those who took part in the privatisation formed one criminal group that allowed Abramovich and Berezovsky to trick the government and not pay the money that this company was really worth."" The document also suggests Mr Abramovich was protected by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin.  It says law enforcement files on Mr Abramovich were moved to the Kremlin and that an investigation by Mr Skuratov was stopped by the president. The document says: ""Skuratov was preparing a criminal case for the confiscation of Sibneft on the basis of the investigation of its privatisation. The investigation was stopped by President Yeltsin â¦ Skuratov was dismissed from his office."" Mr Skuratov was sacked after the release of a sex tape in 1999. He says it was a stitch-up to discredit him and his investigation. He said: ""This whole thing was obviously political, because in my investigations I came very close to the family of Boris Yeltsin, including via this investigation of the Sibneft privatisation."" Mr Abramovich remained in the Kremlin inner circle when Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000.  The document contains details of another rigged auction two years later, involving a Russian oil company called Slavneft. Mr Abramovich formed a partnership with another firm to buy Slavneft, but a rival Chinese company was planning to bid almost twice as much. Many powerful people - from the Kremlin to the Russian parliament - would have stood to lose out if the Chinese won the auction. The document says that a member of the Chinese delegation was kidnapped when they arrived in Moscow for the auction. ""CNPC, Chinese company, a very strong competitor, had to withdraw from the auction after one of its representatives was kidnapped upon arrival at Moscow Airport and was released only after the company declared its withdrawal."" The kidnapping story is backed up by independent sources who did not know about the document. Vladimir Milov was Russia's deputy energy minister in the run up to the Slavneft sale. He didn't comment on the kidnapping story, but he said senior political figures had already decided that Mr Abramovich's partnership would win the auction. ""I said, look, the Chinese want to come in and they want to pay a much bigger price. They say it doesn't matter, shut up, none of your business. It's already decided. Slavneft goes to Abramovich, the price is agreed. The Chinese will be dragged out somehow."" There is no suggestion that Mr Abramovich knew anything about the kidnapping plot, or played any part in it. His lawyers told the BBC the kidnap claim ""is entirely unsubstantiated"" and he has ""no knowledge of such incident"". Different factions had been fighting for control of Slavneft and there was widespread opposition to the Chinese bid. Whatever the reason for the Chinese withdrawal, Mr Abramovich's partnership had the only bid left on the table. And they bought Slavneft at a knockdown price. Mr Abramovich's lawyers say allegations of corruption in the Slavneft and Sibneft deals are false, and he denies he was protected by Mr Yeltsin."
Russia-Ukraine war: British Fox News journalist injured,2022-03-14T22:31:52.000Z,"A British journalist working for the Fox News Channel in the US has been injured while reporting on the war in Ukraine, the network says. Fox confirmed on air that Benjamin Hall - listed as its US state department correspondent - is in hospital after an incident outside of the capital Kyiv. Afternoon news anchor John Roberts added teams on the ground were still gathering details of the incident. Mr Hall is said to have been news gathering at the time. In a memo circulated to Fox employees on Monday, CEO Suzanne Scott said there was ""a minimum level of details right now"" and called for prayers. ""This is a stark reminder for all journalists who put their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from a war zone,"" she wrote. Mr Hall, 39, joined Fox News in 2015 and has been heavily involved in the network's foreign affairs coverage. He has covered several wars from the frontlines, including in parts of the Middle East. A dual US-UK citizen, he completed both his undergraduate and graduate degrees in London. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, posted on Telegram on Monday that Mr Hall was in a serious condition. Mr Gerashchenko added that Ukrainian officials did not currently know the fate of a Fox News cameraman and a producer. He said the news crew probably ""came under mortar or artillery fire"" from Russian forces as they were heading towards the city of Irpin, which sits just 20km (12 miles) north-west of Kyiv. Earlier on Monday, Ukraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova had said that a Western journalist had been injured and was being cared for by Ukrainian doctors. The State Department Correspondents' Association issued a statement, saying the state department's press corps was ""horrified"" to learn that Mr Hall had been injured.  ""We know Ben for his warmth, good humor and utmost professionalism. We wish Ben a quick recovery,"" president of the association, Shaun Tandon, said. Mr Hall's injuries come after another US journalist - Brent Renaud - was shot and killed on Sunday in the town of Irpin while working in the region. Two other journalists were injured and taken to hospital in the same attack."
Julian Assange denied permission to appeal against extradition,2022-03-14T20:36:27.000Z,"The Supreme Court has refused to allow Julian Assange his latest appeal against extradition to the US. A court spokesman said Mr Assange's application did not raise ""an arguable point of law"". The decision is a major blow to his hopes to avoid extradition. The Wikileaks founder, 50, is wanted in the US over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011. His lawyers said he had not ruled out launching a final appeal. The case will now go back down to District Judge Vanessa Baraitser, the original judge who assessed the US's extradition request.  Profile: Julian AssangeAssange can be extradited to the US, court rules Assange's US extradition blocked on health grounds Home Secretary Priti Patel is then expected to make a final decision. If she approves the extradition, that is the stage when Mr Assange could make his fresh challenge, said his lawyers Birnberg Peirce. Mr Assange faces an 18-count indictment from the US government, accusing him of conspiring to hack into US military databases to acquire sensitive secret information relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which was then published on the Wikileaks website. The Wikileaks documents revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan, while leaked Iraq war files showed 66,000 civilians had been killed, and prisoners tortured, by Iraqi forces. The US says the leaks broke the law and endangered lives, but Mr Assange says the case is politically motivated. Extradition law includes safeguards that Parliament hoped would provide a suspect with a full and fair opportunity to challenge their removal to another country, particularly where there are legitimate questions over how they will be treated.  This Supreme Court decision underlines that past controversies over conditions in the US's most secure jails  - and the manner in which it provides assurances over humane treatment - are, in legal terms, a settled matter for our law.  Assuming the home secretary approves the extradition - which may not be before June - Mr Assange can still try to open up the parts of the US case he lost way back in January 2021.  They include potentially important questions about whether his actions as Wikileaks chief were protected by human rights safeguards concerning freedom of speech. So while the Supreme Court's decision means he's closer than ever to extradition, this affair is not over yet.  In January 2021, a lower judge who deals with extradition requests ruled that while the US had a case to prosecute Mr Assange for alleged offences relating to the mass hacking of government systems, he could not be sent from the UK to stand trial - because there was no guarantee that American authorities could safely care for him. At the time, lawyers for Mr Assange argued his fragile mental health meant the US would find it impossible to stop him taking his own life - amid fears he was likely to be subject to solitary confinement. The High Court then reversed that decision last December, saying that the US had provided good enough assurances that proved Mr Assange could be safely cared for. Senior judges found the lower judge had based her decision on the risk of Mr Assange being held in highly-restrictive prison conditions if extradited. However, the US authorities later gave assurances that he would not face those strictest measures unless he committed an act in the future that merited them. Then, last month, Lord Burnett, the Lord Chief Justice, said there was now a legal question over how those assurances had been provided - and gave Mr Assange's lawyers 14 days to make the application to the Supreme Court. Monday's denial means the US extradition request still stands. If convicted in the US, Mr Assange faces a possible penalty of up to 175 years in jail, his lawyers have said. However the US government told the High Court the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years - and it would even consider sending him to an Australian jail. At present, the Australian-born editor and activist is jailed in London's Belmarsh Prison. He was first detained in the UK in 2010 - and later bailed - after Sweden issued an international arrest warrant over allegations of sexual offences. Swedish authorities wanted to question him over claims that he had raped one woman and sexually molested and coerced another in August 2010 - but he said both encounters were entirely consensual.  Amid a protracted legal battle, he sought asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he spent almost seven years. He argued that he could not leave the embassy because he feared being extradited from Sweden to the US and put on trial for releasing the secret US documents. But in 2019, Ecuador withdrew his asylum status and he was arrested by British police. In May 2019, while serving a jail sentence in the UK for breaching bail, the US justice department filed 17 new charges against the Wikileaks founder for violating the Espionage Act, related to the publication of classified documents in 2010. The investigation into the 2010 rape allegation was dropped by Swedish prosecutors later that year, in November 2019."
Putin changes law on leased jets to keep them flying,2022-03-14T18:21:38.000Z,"Russia has implemented a new law making it harder for foreign aircraft leasing companies to repossess their planes in the face of Western sanctions.  The new law will allow foreign jets to be registered in Russia ""to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of activities in the field of civil aviation"". Russian airlines have 515 jets leased from abroad worth about $10bn (Â£7.7bn). Foreign owners have until 28 March to get them back from Russian companies before sanctions kick in. The move comes after Bermuda and Ireland, where nearly all foreign-leased planes operating in Russia are registered, said they were suspending certificates of airworthiness for those aircraft. The measure, signed into law by President Vladimir Putin, could circumvent that by bringing registration and certification of safety within Russia's borders and use the foreign aircraft to fly domestic routes across the vast country. Since the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Western companies have been terminating leases and asking for planes to be returned.  The majority of international air routes out of Russia are not being flown and many countries, including the UK, have banned Russia's national airline Aeroflot from flying in their airspace. Hundreds of foreign-owned aircraft remain in Russia. To comply with sanctions, leasing companies are trying to get them back. But that is looking highly unlikely. If Russia does hang onto these aircraft - collectively worth billions of dollars - they will be able to continue flying, in Russia and a handful of former Soviet republics at least. But it's one thing to steal aircraft, it's quite another to keep them operating for any length of time. Airbus and Boeing cannot supply spare parts, so when something needs to be replaced it will have to be taken from another plane, or be manufactured by a third party. That has serious safety implications. It will also make it virtually impossible to insure those planes outside Russia. Servicing is also a concern - many aircraft are flown elsewhere for maintenance. And when the crisis is over there will be a huge bill to pay.  If aircraft are not maintained properly, their value will plummet. So even if lessors get them back, they will demand compensation. International aviation is an international business, and you have to play by the rules.  Russia could decide to thumb its nose at the rest of the world now. But one day it will want to rejoin the club - and the conditions for rejoining could be very harsh."
"Logan Mwangi: Murder-accused, 14, was 'a monster'",2022-03-14T17:49:10.000Z,"A teenager accused of murdering a five-year-old boy has been described as ""a monster"" and spoke of killing people, a court has heard.  The body of Logan Mwangi was found in the River Ogmore in Sarn, Bridgend, last July with 56 injuries.  The court heard the boy said he wanted to kill Logan shortly before his death.  The 14-year-old boy, Logan's mother Angharad Williamson, 30, and his step-father John Cole, 40, are on trial at Cardiff Crown Court and deny murder. Logan's mum: 'What have you done with my son?'Logan mum said she'd miss punishing him - courtBoy, 5, found in river had 'significant injuries' In statements read to the court, the former foster family of the accused said he made their lives ""hell"" during a period that he lived with them, and described him as a ""monster"". He also told the family he would kill them, explaining he would do so if the plot of the horror film The Purge - in which all crime, including murder, becomes decriminalised in a 12-hour period- became real.  The boy's foster father said he had become ""terrified"" of the boy who had told him he wanted to ""punch his lights out"".  The family also told of the boy's behaviour towards their family dog, who he insisted on pulling up by his hind legs and keep him dangling even though he was aware the dog had an injured pelvis. There was also reference to an occasion when he had been witnessed spraying a can of deodorant into the dog's eyes. The jury heard how on more than one occasion the teenager, who was 13 at the time, had said he wanted to kill Logan. As details of the teen's behaviour was read to the court, Logan's mother Angharad Williamson began crying loudly from the dock. The foster family said they had continuously raised concerns about the accused's behaviour and threats with a social worker, Debbie Williams, but these were dismissed as ""nonsense"".  ""She just brushed it off as if it was nothing,"" the foster mother said in her statement. In evidence, Ms Williams denied she was ever told about these concerns.  She told the court how she had visited the accused at a number of addresses - at first virtually, and then in person as Covid restrictions eased. Ms Williams described how the teenager would sometimes ""poke, pinch or kick her"" during meetings but said he never hurt her. She also said the teenager used to swear at her regularly, but said she felt it was mainly banter. She said she last saw the teenager on 30 July and the teenager was ""his usual cheeky self, swearing at me."" Ms Williams was also asked about a conversation she had with the teenager around a month after Logan had died. She told the court, she'd said to the teenager: ""I don't think you realise the seriousness of the situation you are in."" The accused replied: ""I do know that... we didn't hurt him."" A neighbour of Mr Cole in Maesglas, Sarn, Sheryl Lewis, also gave evidence.  She said she heard Mr Cole crying outside on the phone at about 21:20 BST on 31 July, saying: ""Help me, help me. What should I do? What should I do?"" All three defendants deny murder and are also accused of perverting the course of justice, including moving Logan's body to the river near Pandy Park, removing his clothing, washing blood-stained bed linen, and making a false missing person report to police. Ms Williamson and the youth pleaded not guilty to perverting the course of justice, while Mr Cole admitted the charge. The trial continues."
Ukraine war: UK to discuss oil stability with Saudi Arabia,2022-03-14T16:43:48.000Z,"The UK government is to discuss how to diversify energy supply following disruption caused by the war in Ukraine, Downing Street has said. Petrol prices for UK drivers have reached record highs of more than Â£1.60 a litre in recent days. The PM's spokesman said discussions with Saudi officials would look to tackle market volatility but there were no ""quick fixes"" available. It comes after 81 men were executed in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Foreign Office Minister Amanda Milling said the British government was ""deeply shocked"" by the executions, and opposed the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Replying to an urgent question from Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, she said the issue had already been raised with the Saudi authorities, and the government would continue to ""speak frankly"" about human rights.  Petrol prices set to ease after hitting fresh highsEnergy boss: US gas can replace Russian suppliesSaudis execute 81 men in one day Mr Blunt said the executions were ""appalling"" and had presented the prime minister with ""exquisite difficulties"" when asking Saudi Arabia for help in easing oil shortages.  Ms Milling told MPs the UK was phasing out Russian oil, adding that it was important to have stability in energy markets, and there was a role for OPEC - of which Saudi Arabia is a key member - in this.  Human rights groups say many of those executed did not receive fair trials, but the Saudi government denies this. The average price of petrol for UK drivers hit Â£1.63 a litre on Sunday, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushing up costs. Asked whether the UK wanted Saudi Arabia - the world's second-biggest oil producer - to increase supplies, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We will be speaking to the Saudis about a range of issues, not just energy supply. ""Diversifying our energy supply is important, as is boosting renewable energy. There are no quick fixes but we do want to reduce the volatility and bring prices down."" Boris Johnson held a meeting with ministers and leaders of gas and oil companies - including Shell, Esso and BP - on Monday, during which he voiced a ""firm commitment"" to continuing extractions from the North Sea. They agreed to work to ""remove barriers facing investors and developers, and help projects come online more quickly"", Downing Street said. Saudi Arabia says those executed on Saturday, including seven Yemenis and one Syrian national, had been convicted of ""multiple heinous crimes"", including terrorism, torture, rape and weapons smuggling. The number put to death exceeded the 69 who faced that fate during the whole of 2021. ""The UK is firmly opposed to the death penalty in every country as a matter of principle,"" the PM's spokesman said.  ""We continue to raise human rights issues with other countries including Saudi Arabia. We do not shy away from raising these issues with our partners."" In the Commons, Labour's spokesman Bambos Charalambous said it was no coincidence that the Saudis had carried out the mass executions while the world's attention was elsewhere.  Responding to reports that Boris Johnson is to visit Riyadh, the SNP spokesman, Alyn Smith, said no such visit should take place, after what he described as an ""atrocity"". "
UK's most premature twins reunited as sister returns home,2022-03-14T18:02:25.000Z,"A pair of twins thought to be the most premature to survive in the UK are both home with their family. Harley and Harry Crane were born at 22 weeks and five days at the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham. Harry was discharged last week after almost five months in the neonatal unit, and his sister Harley is now home too after 140 days in intensive care. Their parents Steve and Jade Crane, from Heanor, Derbyshire, said they were ""absolutely ecstatic"". ""It's been such a long time and although it's been a really, really treacherous journey, 140 days ago we didn't think we'd be here,"" said Mr Crane. ""It's just so affirmative to see them together and to be walking out that door.  ""The absolutely stunning doctors, nurses and surgeons have all been part of the making of this moment. It's hard to say goodbye to them but I hope I never see them again."" When they were born, Harry weighed 520g (1.14lb) and Harley 500g (1.10lb). They were described by doctors as the size of Mars bars.  The babies were put into the bereavement suite for parents because doctors expected only one of them would survive. However their parents said they had been ""little fighters"".  ""Can't wait to get them home where they belong and start our life as a family,"" said Mrs Crane. ""We've waited 140 days for this. It's really emotional. Sad to leave the team but happy to be going home.""  The couple, who have been sharing their journey on Instagram, had tried to have children for 11 years with multiple IVFs, spending Â£50,000 on fertility treatments. The twins have had six operations and 25 blood transfusions between them, and suffered sepsis, eye problems, brain and lung bleeds. Doctors warned they could face developmental challenges in the future and they still need oxygen to help them breathe, which will be monitored at home by their parents. Neonatologist, Dr Chantelle Tomlinson, said the day was ""huge"" for the family and had ""been coming for a really long time for them"". She said while their news was exciting it is never to be taken for granted that all the babies will go home.  ""For any of the families who need our real high-level intensive care, and have spent time on the unit with us, there's nothing to be presumed about the fact that they're going to go home, so we're delighted that they [the Crane twins] are.""

Ukraine conflict: What military and economic support could China offer Russia?,2022-03-14T17:15:27.000Z,"Russia is increasingly looking for allies as the war in Ukraine intensifies and international economic sanctions bite. China has sought to keep a diplomatic distance from the conflict, choosing to abstain in a UN vote condemning Russia's invasion. But if it chose to do so, how far could China help Russia by expanding its military and economic ties? Moscow has asked China for military equipment in support of its invasion of Ukraine, according to US official quoted in media reports. China says this is untrue and has called the reports ""disinformation"".  In recent years, most of the movement in arms has been the other way. China has relied heavily on Russian military hardware to modernise its armed forces, made increasingly necessary by the imposition of US and European arms embargoes in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. About 80% of China's total arms imports were from Russia between 2017 and 2021, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). These Chinese purchases make up 21% of Russia's total arms exports - its second largest global customer.  But China has been gradually expanding its own military production capabilities.  It's now the world's fourth largest arms exporter. ""China's weapons are getting more advanced now. Its drones, for example, are one area that Russia would be very interested in,"" says Siemon Wezeman at SIPRI.  But, he says, ""so far we haven't seen any evidence"" that Russia has bought Chinese drones. China accounted for around 18% of Russia's overall trade in 2021 - almost $147bn (Â£110bn) last year . During President Putin's visit to Beijing in February for the Winter Olympics, the two countries said they would boost trade to $250bn by 2024. China is a major importers of grains such as wheat and barley and one of its most important sources is Russia - one of the world's largest producers. Until very recently, China had placed restrictions on the importing of wheat and barley from Russia because of disease concerns. But these were all lifted on the day the Russian assault on Ukraine began. However, as a bloc, the EU remains by far the biggest overall trading partner with Russia. In 2021, total trade between the two was worth almost twice as much as China's trade with Russia.   That could now be changing.  ""It is inevitable that EU-Russia trade diminishes in the light of sanctions"" , says trade economist Dr Rebecca Harding. ""The current crisis has just sharpened a focus within the EU on the need to diversify supply"". China is one of the biggest markets for Russian oil, gas and coal.  Just a week before the Ukraine invasion, the two countries agreed on a new Russian coal deal worth more than $20bn.  Mr Putin also recently unveiled new Russian oil and gas deals with China worth an estimated $117.5bn.  However, Russia's biggest energy market by far has been the EU, and it supplies 40% of the bloc's gas and about 26% of its oil.   ""Russian exports of oil and gas [to China] have been increasing at a rate of over 9% annually for the last five years"". says Dr Harding.  ""This is rapid growth but even so, China is half as big as the EU market for Russian oil."" China says it will ""continue to have normal trade co-operation"" with Russia.  But some Russian banks have been banned from the Swift international payment system. This has already forced companies in China, as elsewhere, to cut back purchases from Russia as traders struggle to arrange financing. Both China and Russia have encouraged moves towards alternative payment methods in recent years. Russia has its System for Transfer of Financial Messages (STFM) while China has the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), both of which operate in their own currencies. But Swift has continued to dominate the financial transactions in the global trading network. Currently only about 17% of trade between Russia and China uses the Chinese yuan (up from 3.1% in 2014), according to media reports citing official Russian statistics.  Energy trading between the two countries is still mostly done in US dollars.

Ukraine war: Pub dedicated to Hemingway destroyed in Kharkiv,2022-03-14T21:39:57.000Z,"You'll Never Drink Alone were the words that hung above the bar at the Old Hem, an iconic pub in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.  The pub is named after Ernest Hemingway, and its patrons would walk past a statue of the legendary American writer on their way in. It was popular among the city's young creatives, and Serhiy Zhadan, one of Ukraine's best known poets, would often perform and drink there. But now the Old Hem lies in ruins.  It was completely destroyed during Russian shelling of the city on Monday. The Kharkiv prosecutor's office says two people died in the attack. The bar's owner, Kostiantyn Kuts, told the BBC that no staff were in the bar when the strike hit, and those who died were in apartments above the pub.  The Old Hem stopped pouring pints and turned into a makeshift bomb shelter when the Russian army invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Mr Kuts says.  He initially hoped that he'd only be shutting up briefly.  ""We did not completely believe in what was happening and hoped that soon the bar would work. But the illusions were destroyed with the first bombs on residential buildings,"" he said in a message.  In the early days of the invasion, Kharkiv fought back a Russian armoured column. Since then, it has suffered nightly Russian airstrikes and shelling, with dozens of civilians killed and hundreds injured. But in the weeks leading up to the invasion, Mr Kuts says it was business as usual at the bar.  ""The atmosphere was friendly. Many felt at home in the bar,"" he says. ""The pub was popular among young people, and they were all optimistic and did not believe in war."" This homely atmosphere was one the Old Hem had built up over a decade. Mr Kuts says the pub was opened in 2012 as a place where people could ""meet and discuss current affairs over a glass of beer"". It soon became a focal point for Kharkiv's creatives and would showcase local talent.

He recalls musician Oleh Skrypka, vocalist with the ground-breaking Ukrainian rock band Vopli Vidopliassova, playing a rare intimate show. Parties would regularly continue into the early hours.  ""It was one of the first places in Kharkiv to support Maidan publicly with flags and manifestos on the doors,"" he says, in reference to the protest movement that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. ""Freedom and democracy combined with cheap beer is why youth loved it I guess,"" he says. The pub was dedicated to Hemingway, one of Mr Kuts' heroes, and had a statue of the writer at the entrance. The walls of the bar were decked out with portraits of other iconic authors including 20th Century Russian writer Sergei Dovlatov, Charles Bukowski and Mark Twain. ""I was often asked the question - why Old Hem?"" Mr Kuts says.  He said this was out of affection for an old friend rather than a reference to his age. But what really made the bar was the people, he adds.  Mr Kuts is now in western Ukraine and is hoping to make it to Germany. But one day he hopes to return to his city to rebuild his beloved bar.  ""I'm sure Hem's story didn't end today,"" he says. ""We will win and Hem will rise again."""
NHS struggling with 'long tail' of pandemic mental ill health,2022-03-15T00:07:45.000Z,"The number of referrals for specialist NHS mental health care reached a record high in England by the end of 2021, an analysis suggests. The Royal College of Psychiatrists says the pandemic has led to unprecedented demand and backlogs and services are struggling to keep up.  There were 4.3 million referrals, for conditions such as anxiety and depression, in 2021, NHS Digital says. Just under a quarter - 1.025 million - were for children or adolescents. Child mental health: Huge rise in severe cases, BBC analysis reveals The previous two years had each seen about 3.8 million referrals.  The college said the NHS had delivered 1.8 million mental health consultations in December 2021, as the Omicron variant of Covid-19, first identified in South Africa, spread across the UK.  But an estimated 1.4 million people were still waiting for treatment.  And hundreds of adults were being sent far from home for treatment because of a lack of beds in their area. President Dr Adrian James said: ""As the pressure on services continues to ratchet up, the silence from government continues to be of grave concern for the college, the wider mental health workforce and, most importantly, our patients.   ""The warning of the long tail of mental ill health caused by the pandemic has not been heeded.  ""Many thousands of people will be left waiting far too long for the treatment they need unless the government wakes up to the crisis that is engulfing the country.  ""Staff are working flat out to give their patients the support they need but the lack of resources and lack of staff mean it's becoming an impossible situation to manage.  ""We don't need warm words or empty commitments.  ""We need a fully funded plan for mental-health services, backed by a long-term workforce plan, as the country comes to terms with the biggest hit to its mental health in generations.""  Marjorie Wallace from the mental health charity SANE said: ""We need urgent action or our failures to act now may leave us with a lost generation. The huge rise in the number of referrals last year, including more than one million children, suggests that we are sleepwalking into a crisis. ""Mental health staff are so depleted and on their knees that we know of patients and families told they have to wait until something terrible happens before action is taken."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring everyone is able to access the help and advice they need, which is why we are investing an additional Â£2.3 billion a year into mental health services by 2023/24, on top of the Â£500 million we have made available to address the impact of the pandemic.    ""We will be launching a national conversation to inform the development of a new long-term mental health plan later this year."""
Covid in Scotland: What's behind the latest surge?,2022-03-15T16:53:16.000Z,"Just a few weeks ago it seemed Covid was at last losing its grip on our lives.  Under the Scottish government's strategic framework for managing Covid,  Monday 21 March was meant to be the date when the last legal restrictions would be lifted.  Now, against a backdrop of surging cases, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that face coverings will be required in shops and on public transport until early April.  So what's changed and why?  With the world's attention focused on the war in Ukraine, it's unsurprising that a recent resurgence of infections has not attracted the coverage it might have done earlier in the pandemic.  The previous big Covid surge came in late December and early January when the faster spreading Omicron variant prompted a raft of new restrictions including strict attendance limits on large events, the closure of nightclubs and the return of social distancing in pubs and restaurants.  Daily case numbers peaked at more than 20,000 on 3 January, then fell away rapidly before levelling off.  By late February we were typically seeing about 5,500 new confirmed infections per day - but that changed at the start of March.  Some of the increase may be explained by a change in the way the figures are presented, as re-infections are included in the numbers - but it now seems clear that something else has been happening. While the daily case figures have in the past been a reasonable guide to infections, the shifting emphasis onto lateral flow tests rather than PCR testing has led to a suspicion that many positive lateral flow results are not being reported.  Public health experts are increasingly focusing instead on the weekly Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey - where swabs are collected from thousands of households across the UK to give a snapshot of how the virus is circulating.  Importantly, this survey picks up infections among people who are showing no symptoms, who would not show up in the daily figures.  The following chart shows how many people in Scotland are estimated to have had Covid each week, based on the ONS sampling. For much of the time, these ONS estimates mirror the daily cases data, but if you look closely there are some key differences.  The ONS figures suggest that while Covid numbers did fall back sharply after the early January Omicron peak, this respite only lasted for about a fortnight before infections started climbing again.  They also suggest that in recent weeks, the daily case figures have drastically underestimated the extent of Covid infection. The most recent estimate, for the week to 6 March, is that 5.7% (one in 18) of Scotland's population had Covid, the equivalent of 299,900 people - which is the highest figure since ONS sampling began in autumn 2020.  So what's behind the increase?  The Omicron variant of Covid-19 was first identified in South Africa on 24 November, and was detected in the UK a few days later.  Fears about its increased transmissibility proved well-founded as it replaced Delta as the dominant strain, but for most people it caused less severe illness - which contributed to a fall in mortality. Vaccination and improved medical treatments have also driven down the death rate. Omicron is an umbrella term for a number of closely-related versions of the virus -  not so different that they are classed as new variants but instead regarded as ""sub-variants."" What we know about the new Omicron variant  The original version of Omicron is known as BA.1 but early this year a number of countries reported a rise in cases involving the BA.2 sub-variant.  Sometimes dubbed the ""stealth variant"", for most people BA.2 Omicron also causes a milder version of the disease than Delta, but it appears to spread even faster. According to Danish scientists it could be 1.5 times as transmissible as BA.1. BA.2 is now the dominant strain in Scotland - accounting for 85% of cases - and it's come at a time when many of the earlier restrictions such as vaccine passports and limits on large gatherings have already ended.  It's also likely that we're seeing waning immunity over time as the protection given by vaccines wears off. For some older people, it was last autumn when they had their third jab.  Even having had Covid is no guarantee you won't get it again - about 10% of new cases are re-infections, according to Public Health Scotland.  A spring booster programme is now under way for the most vulnerable including the oldest age groups, to top up their protection with a fourth vaccine dose. The better news is that, so far, there doesn't appear a sharp upturn in death rates or numbers of people who are so ill that they require intensive care treatment.  There has, however, been a steady rise since mid-February in the number of patients in hospital with Covid.  On Tuesday there were 1,996 Covid-positive patients, higher than the January 2022 Omicron peak and not far short of the whole-pandemic peak of 2,053 patients seen in January 2021. The chief medical officer, Prof Sir Gregor Smith, says hospital occupancy is particularly increasing for the over-60s, partly because of their increased vulnerability but also because older people tend to have longer hospital stays. Not all of these patients will be in hospital because of Covid - many will have come in for other ailments, but then tested positive. But regardless of how ill these patients are, such big numbers inevitably put enormous strain on the NHS.  NHS Lothian and NHS Grampian say they have more Covid patients now than at any time in the pandemic.  NHS Lanarkshire has said its three acute hospitals are operating beyond capacity and is warning of knock-on impacts on A&E waiting times.  Greater Glasgow's health board says its hospitals are also near capacity, while NHS Highland says some elective surgery is having to be cancelled.   Some might argue that there's little evidence that mask wearing will slow down transmission given that case numbers are already soaring even with existing restrictions in place.  Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross argued in Holyrood that the public should be trusted to take the steps they think are right to protect themselves.  Leading NHS Grampian health expert Jillian Evans, however, had argued that retaining face coverings a little longer would send an important signal.  She told the Press and Journal newspaper: ""Our behaviour is influenced when we see things - such as masks. They are a reminder that we need to be more cautious."" Prof Sir Gregor Smith had also advocated a cautious approach.  The phrase ""living with Covid"" is increasingly heard on the lips of politicians and health experts, as we move from a pandemic phase to endemic - where the disease is always with us, possibly with seasonal peaks like with flu, but with measures in place to protect the most vulnerable. Nicola Sturgeon says the face masks rules should only be with us a little longer, but even when the legal requirement is dropped, the guidance may still advocate their use.  With spring and summer approaching, the hope will be that pressures on the NHS will ease in the coming weeks, but in the meantime people will be urged to maintain voluntarily many of the safeguards that have previously been backed up by law.

IMF: Ukraine economy could shrink as much as 35%,2022-03-14T19:27:04.000Z,"The Ukrainian economy could shrink by more than a third this year if the war with Russia continues, the International Monetary Fund said. The global lending body said the country is already facing a downturn of 10% due to the invasion, which has hit major cities, destroyed airports and precipitated a refugee crisis. The IMF recently sent $1.4bn in emergency funds to Ukraine - the maximum allowed under its rules. Billions more will be needed, it said. The dire economic outlook for Ukraine was included in a report prepared before the emergency loan was approved last week. The estimates were calculated by looking at wartime economies in countries such as Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. ""With the war ongoing, the situation remains extremely fluid, and any forecast is at this stage subject to massive uncertainty,""  the report said, predicting the economy could contract by between 25% to 35%. It said the estimates in the report should be ""seen as a bare minimum"". In 2014 and 2015, Ukraine also suffered economic shock, with output falling 6.6% and 10% respectively, following Russia's annexation of Crimea.  But Ukraine's economy, which is heavily dependent on exports, expanded 3% last year, lifted by a record grain harvest. Output had been expected to grow another 3.6% in 2022. Now, the IMF said: ""A deep recession and large reconstruction costs are to be expected, on the backdrop of a humanitarian crisis."" For now, the government has prioritised defence and social spending and remained current on its foreign debt obligations, according to the 7 March report. Companies are still paying taxes and money is still flowing through its financial system, though many bank branches have shut and authorities have had to take emergency measures. The country is likely to struggle even more, the report warned. The IMF plans to set up tools to help its members send money to help Ukraine, which has already spent the equivalent of $1.4bn to service and repay the government's foreign debt since the start of the war, IMF officials said. In an interview with the BBC, the head of Ukraine's central bank Kyrylo Shevchenko said Russian assets frozen in foreign countries, as a result of sanctions, should be used to help rebuild the country. ""The need for money will be huge,"" he told the BBC. ""It could be fulfilled through loans and grants from multinational organisations and direct help from other countries. However, a large share of financing is needed to be obtained as a reparation from the aggressor, including funds that are currently frozen in our allied countries."""
Outdoor civil weddings and partnerships here to stay,2022-03-15T00:08:08.000Z,"Outdoor civil weddings and partnerships are being legalised permanently in England and Wales. Until last summer, non-religious ceremonies had to be held inside or in a permanent outdoor structure. The rules were relaxed to allow for more guests while coronavirus social distancing measures were in place. The temporary measures are being made permanent from April after ""overwhelming support"" from the public, the Ministry of Justice said.  A government consultation found that 96% of respondents were in favour of the changes being made permanent, with 93% supporting it being extended to religious ceremonies. The weddings and partnership ceremonies will still have to be held at licensed venues.  Reforms to religious ceremonies will follow, the Ministry of Justice said. Civil weddings and partnerships can be held outdoors for first timeCovid 'has highlighted archaic wedding laws' Justice minister Tom Pursglove said: ""A wedding is one of the most important days in a person's life and it is right that couples should have greater choice in how they celebrate their special occasion. ""These reforms will allow couples to hold more personalised ceremonies and provide a welcome boost for the wedding sector."" The government is to also consider recommendations from a Law Commission review into marriage laws, which is due to be published in July. The report is looking at how to modernise marriage law, including widening the locations where people can get married and whether more types of weddings should be legalised. Until 1994, marriage ceremonies in England and Wales could only take place in churches and register offices.  An amendment to the law permitted ceremonies at other locations including landmarks, stately homes and dedicated wedding venues. The sites must be approved by local councils, with a registrar attending to record the ceremony.  For historical reasons, the law already allows Jewish and Quaker wedding ceremonies the option of taking place outdoors.  But other religious ceremonies still currently take place indoors in churches or certified places of worship."

War in Ukraine: What happened on day 19 of Russia's invasion,2022-03-14T22:51:09.000Z,"On day 19 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, some civilians were able to leave the city of Mariupol along a pre-agreed route for the first time.  Mariupol, a key port city in the south-east of Ukraine, is facing a humanitarian crisis after nearly two weeks of continuous Russian shelling, with food, water, and medicine running out and communication to the outside world all but cut off.  There have been several previous agreements to allow civilians to leave the city, but they quickly broke down each time.  On Monday, however, the Mariupol city council said 160 private vehicles had managed to leave and were on their way to the relative safety of Zaporizhzhia - a city to the north-west.  The level of destruction in Mariupol was made clear in drone footage, which showed bombed out apartment blocks and smoke rising from the rubble. Last week, Russian bombs hit a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Powerful images of two pregnant women escaping from the wreckage were shared around the world.  But on Monday, we learned that one of the women had died along with her baby who was stillborn by Caesarean section.  After delivering the baby, who showed no signs of life, medics focused on the mother but were unable to keep her alive, surgeon Timur Marin told the Associated Press.  In another vivid example of the terrible conditions in Mariupol, the city's deputy mayor told the BBC that several burial sites had been dug to cope with the rising number of civilian deaths.  Serhiy Orlov said the city's street cleaners and road repair teams were collecting dead bodies in the street. More than 2,500 people have been killed in Mariupol since the war began, according to a Ukrainian presidential adviser. The BBC heard similar stories from local officials elsewhere in Ukraine, for example the town of Bucha near Kyiv, where more than 60 people were buried in a mass grave.  Away from the dire situation on the ground, the war continues to have far-reaching international consequences.  After multiple US news outlets reported that Russia had requested military help from China, the US warned that there would be consequences if Beijing helped Russia to evade sanctions.  The Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of spreading disinformation, and Russia later denied asking Beijing for military help. With tensions between the global superpowers so high, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday that further escalation of the conflict ""threatens all of humanity"", with the prospect of nuclear conflict ""now back within the realm of possibility"".  Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shone a spotlight on the expensive homes around the world that belong to billionaire Russians, many of whom are allies of Vladimir Putin.  On Monday, protesters in London climbed onto the balcony of a mansion in central London thought to belong to the energy tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who has been sanctioned by the UK government over the war in Ukraine.  The protesters said they were reclaiming the building for Ukrainian refugees who have fled their homes.  LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyKYIV: Ukraine generals on why Kyiv will not fall easilyIMPACT: One shell that destroyed a familyWATCH: Five times refugees were met with kindnessIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict The UK government is examining whether the properties of sanctioned oligarchs could be used to house refugees, according to the prime minister's official spokesperson, although it is thought new legislation would be required. In the city of Kharkiv, in north-east Ukraine, the beloved Old Hem bar - named after the owner's literary hero Ernest Hemmingway - was destroyed by Russian shelling.  An extraordinary image shared widely on social media showed the building which once housed the pub reduced to rubble.  The owner - now in western Ukraine - told the BBC that he hopes to return one day to his city and rebuild his bar.  ""We will win and Hem will rise again,"" Kostiantyn Kuts said.  Russia's invasion is taking place on several fronts.  Although Ukraine's resistance has been stronger than expected, Russian forces continue to take territory in the south and are slowly moving towards the capital, Kyiv.

Ukraine war: A baby born under bombardment in Bucha,2022-03-15T00:49:38.000Z,"Anna Tymchenko was scared. She had been in labour for hours but her hometown was being bombed and her apartment was shaking. She and her husband were trapped with no electricity, running water or doctor. The small town of Bucha, 30km (18.5 miles) from the capital Kyiv, had come under relentless bombardment since the start of the war. Twenty-one-year-old Anna, along with her husband and brother, had previously taken refuge in the basement of their block of flats. But when the electricity was cut off and the heating stopped working, the basement was plunged into darkness, and it was bitterly cold.  Anna's husband Volodymyr was torn between remaining in Bucha or trying to flee. When they did finally try to escape by car, they had had to turn back when they heard that a column of Russian military vehicles was heading their way. ""We then decided to stay in the apartment,"" Anna told the BBC. ""I preferred to give birth at home and not in a dusty basement. I had difficulty breathing, my lungs hurt.""  When she went into labour late on 7 March, she called her neighbours for help. They agreed to come, but none of them had experience delivering babies. Viktoria Zabrodskaya, Anna's 49-year-old neighbour, told the BBC they worried that if something went wrong, they wouldn't know what to do.   The room was lit with candles and the only available water was freezing cold from bottles.  ""I never imagined that I would give birth in such conditions,"" Anna says. ""It was surreal. It was my first child and I didn't know anything.""  In desperation, Anna's neighbours tried to contact medical staff, but the phone signal was poor. They were eventually able to make contact with a gynaecologist in Bucha after getting a signal from the balcony. He agreed to come but never appeared.    Later that day, he messaged with an apology and explained that he had been stopped by a Russian patrol who had broken his phone.  Anna's neighbours would have to deliver the baby themselves. Only one of them - Irina Yazova - had any medical expertise.  ""When the baby's head came out, we got scared,"" Viktoria says. ""She was blue and we didn't know what to do. Then Irina gently turned the baby's head and she came out. She didn't cry at first - we started hitting her, and then she cried and we all cheered."" Husband Volodymyr cried tears of relief for baby Alisa, who was born on 8 March - International Women's Day.

""We spent the whole night discussing whether to go or not,"" Anna says. She and her husband finally decided to leave with their new-born child. They tried to contact people to ask if the route was safe, and downloaded maps on to their phones. The following day, 21 cars left the town heading towards Kyiv. Viktoria, who had helped deliver Anna's baby, drove at the front of the convoy, a white flag wrapped around a mop attached to her car and a sign saying ""Children"".   ""On the way we saw horrible scenes,"" Anna says. ""I never thought that I would see such things in real life - only in movies. There were dead bodies lying on the road. The houses were destroyed. Russian tanks parked, pointing their barrels at the road. We were so scared that they could fire when we passed by.""  After several hours the evacuees had safely passed all the Russian checkpoints and arrived in Kyiv - and from there went their separate ways.  ""When we got out, I couldn't stop smiling,"" Anna says. ""I couldn't believe that we managed to flee.""   Anna is enjoying motherhood and is looking forward to introducing her parents to their new granddaughter. But while many of her relatives have now left the country, she and her husband cannot leave - and Anna says that she still doesn't feel completely safe.  ""All my thoughts are with what's happening [in Bucha] and in the rest of the country,"" she says. ""It's just unbelievable but we hope that we can return home soon.""

"Ukraine war: Kyiv terrain will slow Russian troops, say Ukraine generals",2022-03-15T00:52:17.000Z,"At a briefing in their war room on Monday, the two Ukrainian generals responsible for the defence of Kyiv told the BBC how their forces were fighting hard to keep Russian artillery out of range, and explained why they believe the city has strengths that will make all the difference against the Russians. Kyiv is feeling the sharp touch of the war more acutely, along with Russia's destructive firepower.  A nine-storey block of flats was hit by a Russian missile on Monday morning, killing at least one person and wrecking the building, making dozens of Ukrainians homeless. It would have been worse had many residents not taken to shelters.  But the centre of Kyiv and many of its sprawling suburbs are still untouched by Russian weaponry. Other Ukrainian cities are being very heavily shelled, and there have been many casualties.  Kyiv's remaining citizens - perhaps half have moved to western Ukraine or left the country - are facing the possibility that the same brutal experience lies ahead for them. The generals responsible for Kyiv's defence said they were fighting hard to keep Russian artillery out of range, but accepted that the capital was vulnerable to missiles. However the city's topography and terrain is on their side, Gen Andriy Kryschenko told me. The city is big and sprawling. It is cut up by rivers, not just the mighty Dnieper which divides Kyiv in two, but its tributaries.  ""It is difficult to defend on the one hand, given that it is very large,"" he told me. ""But on the other hand, this is a plus. Rivers, bridges, are on the approaches to the city. Our troops are building defences and fortifications.  ""Around the city there are many small rivers that flow into the Dnieper and there are many peat bogs, so that means the area is not suitable for large-scale movement of troops.""  Gen Kryschenko, who is also a deputy mayor, was wearing the same kind of informal outfit in army green that his President Volodymyr Zelensky has worn to rally his people, impress his allies and infuriate his enemies. The general also exuded the president's optimism.  Another advantage, according to the general, is that Kyiv is an industrial city, with workshops and factories that have repurposed themselves to produce the items needed for fortifications - concrete blocks, sandbags, and a variety of savage-looking anti-tank obstacles. Gen Kryschenko and Gen Knyazev stood in front of the big interactive screen they use to track the Russian push towards Kyiv.  They explained they had attacked and stopped the forward movement of two main thrusts, one from the east and one from the north-west, which included the much talked about 64km (40 mile) column of Russian armour.  They said it had been attacked and forced to disperse, and insisted it was no longer a threat.  The north-west is still the Russians' main focus. Gen Knyazev pointed to what he said was the closest force of Russian infantry. It was the other side of the Irpin River, around 20km (12 miles) from central Kyiv. The Ukrainians have deployed a well-organised and well-armed force, which has blown strategic bridges. Thousands of people displaced from the town of Irpin have been filing over the river on the remains of the one of them with a few possessions and very often, their dogs and cats.   But the Russians, said Gen Knyazev, have not been able to follow them.   ""These are such marshy lowlands, and they can't pass them. If there were no Ukrainian soldiers, they would simply throw a pontoon crossing over the river. But we are there, and we want to destroy them."" As we were talking another missile exploded not far from the first one. The noise of the blast could be heard clearly in the war room. ""Listen,"" said a junior officer, ""that was our air defence bringing down another one."" But it did not take the missile out in mid-air. A trolley bus conductor was killed when it hit the ground with a big explosion that also wrecked a line of buildings.  Ukrainian military success has surprised their friends, and their enemies. The president and his commanders are more than pleased with the performance of their army and thousands of volunteers.  But the Russians have not turned anything like their full force on this capital city yet.

Newspaper headlines: 'Rush to take in Ukrainians' and 'you're Putin us up mate',2022-03-16T00:00:57.000Z,"""UK families open homes to refugees"" is the i's lead. The paper reports that the public is responding generously and there is no cap on the number of people who can be sponsored. This comes after the UK government launched its Homes for Ukraine scheme for those wanting to host a refugee.  The Daily Mail also reports on the Homes for Ukraine refugee scheme. The numbers signing up to host a refugee is changing at speed, but the paper reports that as of 21:30 GMT on Monday, nearly 44,000 people had signed up. The Sun's lead says the ""nation rallies against Putin"" and ""big-hearted Brits"" with their ""incredible generosity crashed the Homes for Ukraine appeal website in its first two hours"".  The Times leads on the UK government scheme to welcome Ukrainian refugees, and then goes on to picture Roman Abramovich in Ben Gurion airport, in Tel Aviv, Israel. The paper reports that Mr Abramovich is allegedly part of a ""Â£2bn organised crime scam"", according to an investigation by BBC's Panorama. His lawyers have said that there was no basis for alleging that he had amassed his wealth through criminal activity. ""You're Putin us up mate"" is the Metro's lead. The paper reports that a group of protesters stormed Oleg Deripaska's Â£50m London mansion. It reports that, according to the protesters, the mansion was ""liberated"" and they would be inviting Ukrainian refugees to move into the property. No 10 has said it is looking at the possibility of housing Ukrainian refugees in the empty properties of sanctioned Russian oligarchs. The Guardian's front page pictures ""an extraordinary protest"". A woman holding an anti-war sign ran onto the set of a Russian evening news programme on the state-controlled Channel 1 on Monday evening. The sign read ""no war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here"". Meanwhile, its lead story says Russia's deadly raids are plunging Ukrainians into a nightmare. The Daily Mirror reports that three British people were killed in ""missile hell"" in the Polish border, which ""left more than 100 dead"". The Daily Express also reports on three ex-special forces British people who have reportedly been killed in Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to confirm this information.

The popular apps aiming to tame the chaos of family life,2022-03-15T00:22:57.000Z,"""My husband and I couldn't live without three apps,"" says Jo O'Connell, from Bournemouth in Dorset. She lives with her husband, Jonathan, their two children, Bethany and Bo, plus one rescue dog. As well as juggling household and family responsibilities, she also runs her own public relations company. ""Everyone has busy lives,"" she says. ""There is school work, appointments, shoppingâ¦ all constantly demanding our attention. We used to double-book ourselves, waiting to get back home to look at a calendar, or shopping list on the fridge."" The O'Connells turned to technology, looking for apps that would update on their phones immediately, giving them shared information in real-time. Trello is a list-making app, which the family use to keep track of household chores, to manage a house renovation, to list account passwords, favourite recipes, and Christmas and birthday presents. They use Google Calendar to sync activities, and OurGroceries to plan meals and share shopping lists. ""The pace of life just gets faster and faster,"" says Ms O'Connell. ""It can be overwhelming. We never stop."" Research shows that communication is key to maintaining a relationship through stressful times. With the increased pressures of modern life, is the way we're communicating with our partners changing? Lou Baltruschat Hollis, 35, from Bedfordshire, is another working parent juggling a busy schedule. She lives with her husband and their two young boys. ""Running a business full time and having two children - there is always a lot going on in our lives,"" she says. Research from UN Women suggests that women also took on a greater burden of household work during the pandemic. So, could technology help -among the multitude of apps that promise to help families collaboratively manage their lives, which ones are popular? Ms Baltruschat Hollis trialled various apps. Then she had a brainwave: to re-purpose an existing app she was already using for her online business. Notion is a project management software that is used for note-taking and task management. ""I found it so helpful to compartmentalise things - from cleaning to Christmas,"" says Ms Baltruschat Hollis. ""Using this tech feels simple and streamlined. It makes life easier."" When Steven Rueter, 32, from San Francisco, and his now wife, Lily, first moved in together, they found they had new shared responsibilities to divvy-up.  ""We learned that the seemingly simple tasks of running a household can really add up,"" says Mr Rueter. ""I figured, there needs to be an app for this - so I built Merge."" Task management app, Merge, was launched in 2017.  ""It helps couples organise the everyday responsibilities of living together,"" says Mr Rueter. ""The growth to tens of thousands of users was unexpected. Membership continues to grow daily."" But it's not all about managing life's mundane tasks. After what has been a largely fun-free couple of years, during the pandemic, there are apps popping up geared to helping couples get their lives back.  Apps that help organise adventures, plan for a family or simply spend quality time together. ""We use quite a few apps as a couple,"" says Lavina Dsouza, 34, from Leeds. ""Some to log expenses or for daily chores. But mostly we use them for travel."" Previously, Ms Dsouza and her husband would lose track of budgets and end up paying more than they had planned. Now they use an array of apps to plan for their adventures. ""We particularly like TripIt,"" she says. ""It keeps track of all our reservations and tickets, so we're not arguing [over] who was in charge!"" When Tom, 35, and Madeleine, 32, Whiteley, from Surrey, discovered they were expecting their first child, they turned to an app called Kinder, to help them choose a name for their new baby. ""It was a fun way to do something that was otherwise quite boring,"" says Mr Whitely. ""We'd been out of the dating scene for a while, so doing something Tinder-style was a bit of fun!"" Kinder uses the 'swipe-to-like' characteristic of dating app, Tinder. It was launched in 2016 by Dutch developer, Krijn Haasnoot.  In the first year after it was launched, around 3,000 people downloaded the app. In 2018, the app went viral and has now been downloaded 1.5 million times. ""Technology can improve 'old' ways of doing things by making them more fun,"" says Mr Haasnoot. Another app similar in design to Tinder is Cobble, which promises ""less time planning, more time together"". ""I was tired of going back and forth with my husband every night about what we were doing for dinner,"" says founder, Jordan Scott. ""While there were tonnes of great resources out there, there was nothing to help us collaboratively land on a decision."" Ms Scott launched decision-making app, Cobble, in June 2020. Since then, Cobble has grown to a team of 16 people and, this year, the firm plan to launch in 15 new cities. Cobble makes ""decision-ing"" easy, says Ms Scott - what to watch on TV, which bar to go to, where to go on a mini-break. ""Gone are the days of sending 50 texts back and forth, or going around in circles over what to watch, or what to order. We don't need to waste time like this."" All of the apps mentioned so far, might make life more efficient - but do they just add another layer of screen-based activity?

Recent studies have shown screen time often replaces healthy behaviours like physical activity and sleep and, rather than making us feel more connected, can lead to loneliness and depression. Jeremy Edge, founder of internet addiction counselling service Escapingthe.com raises some concerns. He helps people who suffer from gaming disorders, social media addiction and other problematic screen use. He says that if we are on our devices while in the company of others we are 'phubbing', or ignoring someone in favour of our phones, which ""hurts the relationship and leaves people feeling disconnected"". Mr Edge says social media should be used to contact loved ones, and to organise a place to spend time together in-person.  ""Great relationships are built face-to-face in the physical world,"" he says. ""Couples need time to talk and connect without any screens or distractions."" But back in Bournemouth, Ms O'Connell says using tech as a tool can mean we get to spend more time with our loved ones. ""Simply having a few apps can make life easier,"" she says, ""so you can spend more time doing what you love with those you love."""
Covid: People scared to sing together after lockdowns,2022-03-15T06:04:45.000Z,"A generation of musicians could have been lost in lockdown as people are scared to sing again, Only Boys Aloud's founder has said. Like so many things, choirs and music groups had to come to a sharp halt when lockdowns began. Musical director Timothy Rhys-Evans said ""concerted efforts"" were needed to get singers back up to scratch as time away affected their voices. He said young people needed to ""get off TikTok"" and perform together. Like any muscle, those used to sing and play instruments need to be trained to be in top shape.  However, when you are performing with lagging Zoom calls, masks and mute buttons, it can be quite tempting for some to stay quiet. Grandad, 85, becomes TikTok hit singing with granddaughterGareth Malone on why more people now want to singWelsh choir on the way to the silver screen Now the director of music at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama (RWCMD), Mr Rhys-Evans said: ""For these last two years singers, brass players, woodwind players have almost been public enemy number one. ""It's something my whole musical life has been about, creating those opportunities for us to continue to sing as a nation and we were forbidden from doing that. ""So I have great concerns about the impact of that and what it will be like going back to rehearsal.  ""The voice is a muscle and if you don't use a muscle it loses its flexibility, its strength and also the confidence people have when they sing is not going to be there. ""I'm sure we will come through it, but it's going to take some time."" He said that while people made online meetings work, he was ""just starting to see people lose that freedom to let rip and sing"". ""It's just such a joyful activity, when people have had a few drinks and they're watching Wales in the Six Nations, they burst into song. It's as natural to us as breathing, but when that's been taken away it's going to start to have an impact. ""I think the impact on mental health, particularly of teenagers who have not been able to socialise and discover who they are as musicians, but also discover who they are as people -  is something we will be seeing the effects of for some years to come."" Classical singer Elin Manahan Thomas, from Swansea, sung at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding in 2018. She said people were feeling nervous about performing again at all levels. ""It might seem like small fry in the great scheme of things, but actually they've had a huge knock,"" she said. ""Singing was first to go in the pandemic, very much the last to come back because it was seen as evil because we had to breathe in order to sing."" She said people often forget how physical performing could be. ""It [the voice] needs training as much as athletes need to train - singers need to keep their voices going. ""The whole body is involved in making that sound and in tuning and perfecting it.  ""So it's going to take a while for muscle memory to come back, for our breath support to be there, to get back to the level that everybody was at."" She said for a lot of choirs and musical groups, coming back together has been an ""emotional experience"" but many still lacked confidence. ""It's about finding out the little tricks to warm up the voices, to practise getting the breath support, so that you can get back to the level you were on and reach that repertoire that maybe you've been aiming for a while, but you feel it isn't quite within your reach. ""I think more than anything it's a social experience singing in a choir, it's about listening to each other because it's about blend and tuning and it's about creating something as a team and that's not going be there straight away. ""It's going to get better and it's a lovely thing to do as a team. But do not put too much pressure on perfection, because it's going to take a while to get back to where you personally want to be, so that you as a team, can create that same volume of fantastic sound.""

War in Ukraine: Why Vladimir Putin couldn't have trained fighters in Africa,2022-03-15T00:40:37.000Z,"A black and white image which some people falsely claim shows Russian President Vladimir Putin training liberation movements in southern Africa, has been circulating.  It has been used by some to justify why African countries should support Russia in the war in Ukraine. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter The image was also posted on Twitter by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's son. But it doesn't show Mr Putin in Africa, and the time when people are claiming it was taken is also incorrect. The photograph was widely shared online after it was posted in Zimbabwean blogs at the end of 2018. The posts claimed it shows Mr Putin in a Tanzanian military training camp for southern African independence movements in 1973.   Also present in the photo, it was claimed, were future Mozambique President Samora Machel and Emmerson Mnangagwa, now the president of Zimbabwe.  ""Putin stayed in Tanzania training freedom fighters for four years from 1973 to 1977,"" the blogs also claimed. However, there is no evidence either from Russian or African records of Mr Putin, who was born in 1952, having been to the continent during the 1970s.  Mr Putin's profile on the Kremlin website shows that he was studying at the Leningrad State University at the time, and graduated in 1975. Also outside training offered to Mozambican freedom fighters in camps in Tanzania was largely conducted by Chinese instructors, not Soviet ones. And Mr Mnangagwa could not have been in Tanzania in 1973 as he was arrested in 1965 and imprisoned for 10 years by the white-minority government in then Rhodesia. Mozambican author Renato Matusse used the photo in his 2018 book, where he says it shows Mr Machel with Soviet military advisers touring a military facility near the country's capital Maputo in the mid-1980s. But he says it's clear that Mr Putin is not the man in question. Mr Putin was working as a KGB agent in East Germany between 1985 and 1990 and early on would have been a low-ranking officer, which makes it highly unlikely that he would have been a leading member of such a delegation. There is also no mention of him having visited Mozambique by the Kremlin, or in any of his biographies. Georgi Derluguian, who worked as a Portuguese-Russian interpreter in the 1980s, and is now a professor at New York University Abu Dhabi, says the claim that the man in the photo is Mr Putin ""is a joke"". He says the boots worn indicate the person is a military man, while Mr Putin was an intelligence officer. The appearance is also more like that of an older Mr Putin. And one final piece to add to this puzzle.  The mystery man in the photograph is wearing a watch on his left arm. Mr Putin - at least nowadays - habitually wears one on his right arm. Although the man pictured is thought to be a Soviet official, so far no-one has been able to confirm his actual identity. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions"

Ukraine war: West made terrible mistake after Crimea - PM,2022-03-15T11:34:23.000Z,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the West made a ""terrible mistake"" and let President Vladimir Putin ""get away"" with annexing Crimea in 2014.  Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson said ending the West's dependence on Russian oil and gas was vital to end Kremlin ""bullying"". It comes as the UK banned exports of luxury goods to Russia among other sanctions. About 100 more people are also expected to be sanctioned under a new law. The legislation allows the UK to target individuals alongside the US and the European Union, which has signed off its fourth package of sanctions against Russia. In addition, Mr Johnson said the only way to halt President Putin's ""continuous blackmail"" was by ending western reliance on Russian fossil fuels - a process that would be ""painful"". The prime minister is preparing to head to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf for talks about increasing production of oil and gas to compensate for reduced Russian supplies. Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions?How sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia He also said his promised Energy Security Strategy for the UK would step up wind energy, exploit solar power and make a ""series of big new bets"" on nuclear energy. Further drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea was one suggestion he made. The UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. A decision by the government to talk to Saudi Arabia about measures to bring down the cost of energy has been criticised by many MPs after the country executed 81 people at the weekend. Downing Street says the UK ""will continue to raise human rights abuses"" with Saudi Arabia. The prime minister chaired cabinet meeting this morning before hosting a summit of northern European leaders in London. The leaders of those countries, which form a security alliance called the Joint Expeditionary Force, will consider what steps they can take to help Ukraine and shore up their own resilience against Russia. In a video call to those leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Nato alliance had been ""hypnotised by Russian aggression"" and repeated his plea for western military intervention. While he welcomed the latest western sanctions, Mr Zelensky said they ""are not enough"" to end the war and called for a full trade embargo on Russia. Boris Johnson is talking about taking back control again, but this time of the country's energy supply and, along the way, increasing efforts to make the UK a ""net zero"" carbon emitter. ""Green electricity isn't just better for the environment, it's better for your bank balance,"" says the prime minister in his article in the Daily Telegraph. ""There's nothing [Putin] can do to stop the North Sea wind."" Mr Johnson has been talking about making the UK ""the Saudi Arabia of wind"" for some time now so this is not a new policy, but it would represent a significant acceleration of the move towards low carbon power. Yes, he is backing new drilling in the North Sea, but there's also the promise of ""big new bets"" on nuclear power and - a surprise for many - no mention of the return of fracking, a controversial method of shale gas mining. In his article in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson said: ""When Putin invaded Ukraine the first time round, in 2014, the West made a terrible mistake. The Russian leader had committed an act of violent aggression and taken a huge chunk out of a sovereign country - and we let him get away with it."" Mr Putin ordered the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 after months of protests against its pro-Russian president culminated in his ousting. He then backed an eastern rebellion by pro-Russian separatists, who have fought Ukrainian forces in an eight-year war that has claimed 14,000 lives. Despite years of western sanctions, Russia remains firmly in control of Crimea, which it absorbed following a referendum vote discredited by much of the international community. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last month, a growing number of Russians have been sanctioned by the UK. Most recently, 386 Russian MPs who voted to recognise two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine as independent have been hit by asset freezes and UK travel bans. In its latest sanctions, the EU has agreed bans on any transactions with certain Russian state-owned enterprises and the export of luxury goods to ""directly hit Russian elites"". Sources have told the BBC that the EU's measures will target Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, who has already been sanctioned by the UK.  Co-ordinated with western allies, the sanctions ""will further contribute to ramping up economic pressure on the Kremlin and cripple its ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine"", the European Commission said. BBC Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker says the EU has gone farther and faster than many expected, although there is a growing rift between cautious countries and those like Poland and the Baltic states, who want even stronger measures. On Tuesday, the UK announced new sanctions that mirrored the EU's in several areas, including the export ban on luxury goods such as high-end fashion and works of art. As part of these measures, Russian vodka and hundreds of other goods worth Â£900m were hit with an additional 35% import tariff. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the new tariffs ""will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade"". On top of this, the UK's fast-tracked Economic Crime Bill, which passed through Parliament the early hours of Tuesday, will now allow the UK to automatically sanction those who have had their assets already frozen by the EU, US or Canada. This will potentially open the door to hundreds more individual sanctions. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is likely to announce new measures on Tuesday on more than 100 individuals with links to President Putin's regime, the BBC understands. Speaking to BBC's Hardtalk, senior Conservative and chair of the Defence Select Committee Tobias Ellwood said sanctions on Russia would lead members of the Russian elite and generals to ""recognise there is no future for Russia"" and Mr Putin would ""eventually go"". However, Mr Ellwood warned that ""until then, he will cause absolute carnage in Ukraine and beyond unless we stand up to him"".

China: Businesses shut as officials widen Covid lockdowns,2022-03-15T11:28:41.000Z,"Multinational companies have halted some operations as China widens its Covid lockdowns - among its biggest since the start of the pandemic. Tens of millions of people across the country face restrictions, including the entire Jilin province and technology hub Shenzhen, as authorities report record numbers of cases. Toyota, Volkswagen and Apple supplier Foxconn are among the firms affected. The lockdowns have raised concerns that crucial supply chains may be disrupted.  China on Tuesday reported a record high of more than 5,000 cases, most of it in Jilin. All 24 million residents of the north-eastern province were placed under quarantine orders on Monday. It is the first time China has restricted an entire province since the Wuhan and Hebei lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic.  Jilin residents have been banned from moving around, and anyone wanting to leave the province must apply for police permission.  It came a day after a five-day lockdown was placed on the 12.5 million residents of the southern city of Shenzhen, with all buses and subway services suspended.  On Tuesday authorities in Langfang city which borders the capital Beijing, as well as Dongguan in the southern province of Guangdong, also imposed immediate lockdowns. The messy cost of China's harsh lockdown playbookWhy China is still trying to achieve zero Covid Businesses in many of the affected regions have been told to close or have their employees work from home, unless they supplied essential services like food, utilities or other necessities.  Foxconn, which manufactures iPhones for Apple, stopped its operations in Shenzhen on Monday, saying the date of resumption would ""be advised by the local government"".  But it has several production sites in China and told the BBC it had ""adjusted the production line to minimise the potential impact"". Its plant in Zhengzhou - the world's largest iPhone factory - remains open, as the city was not hit by the restrictions.  Toyota, which shut its factory in Changchun city in Jilin province, did not give a timeline for when business would resume. The Japanese carmaker told the BBC that the move was made to consider the ""impact of supplier operation"", and the ""safety and security of employees and related parties"".  German carmaker Volkswagen also shuttered operations in Changchun, saying production of Volkswagen and Audi cars and their components was ""affected"", but that it hoped to reopen its factory on Thursday.   On Tuesday the Shanghai Composite lost 5% and the Hang Seng index, where several Chinese technology giants are listed, fell more than 6%. Analysts believe that firms would be able to manage the disruptions. ""Such lockdowns have happened before, and [cities] have re-opened within a short period of time once the number of Covid cases were within control,"" Yeang Cheng Ling, senior investment strategist at Singapore's DBS Bank, told the BBC. UBS analyst Grace Chen said Shenzhen was not a ""major"" production site for suppliers, but it would be worrying if the lockdowns extended to Shanghai and surrounding areas as the region is a key manufacturing hub for notebooks, servers and smart devices. It feels like China has gone backwards. Two years backwards. To the early days of the outbreak that first emerged here.  Drastic measures are being imposed - again - on a large scale, to try to contain the virus. An entire province has been sealed off.  The lockdown of Jilin is similar in so many ways to Hubei in early 2020; the area of China where it all began.  Shenzhen, the globally important tech hub (where your iPad was most likely made) is also a city in lockdown.  Shanghai - where I am writing this - home to 24 million people, is a nervous place. All schools are closed, children are learning online, increasingly people are working from home.  Some compounds where people live are enforcing strict rules on who can come in. Deliveries are being sprayed with disinfectant again at the gates.  It's all part of the ongoing effort to maintain/retain/regain China's ""dynamic zero-Covid"" strategy - a goal that has been boosted by the mass roll-out of China's homemade vaccines, and that has been helped hugely by effectively shutting China's borders.  But now that goal is being significantly undermined by the Omicron variant. China has seen relatively fewer cases of Covid due to its strict zero-Covid policy, where it resorts to rapid lockdowns, mass testing and travel restrictions whenever clusters have emerged.  However the rapid transmissibility of the Omicron variant has made sticking to that approach increasingly challenging.  Since the start of the year, China has reported more domestically transmitted cases than in the entire 2021.  Top Chinese infectious disease expert Zhang Wenhong has called the recent outbreaks ""the most difficult period in the last two years of battling Covid"" and that they were still in ""the early stage of an exponential rise"", in an online post widely circulated on social media. But he added that while it was necessary for China to maintain its zero Covid strategy to control the outbreaks for now, ""this does not necessarily mean we will continue implementing the strategy of lockdowns and mass testing forever""."
Ukraine war: Fears Russian aggression could spill into Poland,2022-03-15T04:47:49.000Z,"With Russia's war in Ukraine raging on its doorstep, Poland is holding its breath. It feels vulnerable on two fronts as the number of refugees coming into the country swells and a military base near its border with Ukraine was attacked. As a first responder in one of Europe's biggest refugee crises since World War Two, over 1.7m Ukrainians have chosen to flee to Poland, according to the UN's latest figures. Some move on, but most choose to stay because of cultural, linguistic or family ties. As a result, population figures have swollen by 15% in the Polish capital Warsaw over the past two weeks. In terms of security, alarm bells are also ringing. Over the weekend, Russia bombed a Ukrainian military base in Yavoriv, just 16 km (10 miles) from the Polish border.  Poland warned the West for years that Russia planned to redress the balance of power in Europe in its favour. Polish leaders were dismissed as alarmists at the time. But no longer. ON THE GROUND: Poland feels the strain of Ukraine's refugeesNEAR THE BORDER: 'Sky turned red' as missiles hit Lviv military baseANALYSIS: How many refugees have fled Ukraine and where are they going? On Monday, the Polish Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Ukrainian soldiers needed and deserved Western support. They were fighting not only for their own freedom, he insisted, but also the freedom of their Eastern European neighbours. He also described Russian President Vladimir Putin's onslaught in Ukraine as a calculated part of his geopolitical plan.  Once side-lined by some in Nato as a post-communist Russophobe, Poland has now become a linchpin in the eastern flank of the alliance. The strongest part of the chain now linking the West with Ukraine.  Most of the weapons convoys sent by the West to help the Ukrainian military travel through Poland. On Saturday, Moscow declared those convoys ""legitimate military targets"" inside Ukraine.  But do Poles believe the Kremlin would attack their country - a member of the European Union - and, more significantly in this case, Nato? The Western defence alliance's charter says an attack against one of its nations will be viewed as an attack against all. That would mean a face-off between two global nuclear powers - Russia and the US - something the West is keen to avoid. Moscow too, it hopes. Warsaw's mayor and high profile political figure, Rafal Trzaskowski, told me his country wasn't panicking, but that people were beginning to ask questions - especially after Russia's missile strike so close to the Polish border, and Nato's talk of Russia possibly planning chemical attacks. Something urgent needs to be done about the refugee crisis too, the mayor insisted.  He said one of President Putin's goals was to divide, and therefore weaken, the West. ""Putin is happy to use fake news, disinformation campaigns or a refugee crisis,"" Mr Trzaskowski argued, warning that, ""if refugee numbers keep rising, the system in Poland will crash."" He's called for more international assistance - from the European Union and United Nations - in terms of practical help, financial aid and housing refugees in other countries. Brussels says Ukrainians are welcome across the bloc. It has pledged funds to Poland too. But the authorities here say it's not enough. The European Commission is coy about mentioning exact figures. Mayor Trzaskowski has also appealed to the UK to ""get rid of its red tape"" and allow Ukrainian refugees more easily into Britain. Arguably, Poland's painful past makes it a lot more anxious about the future.  The arrival of Ukrainian refugees here has evoked national memories of war, followed by decades of Soviet occupation. This week in Warsaw, I met Polish pensioner Kristina and her friends, busy making Ukrainian flag solidarity ribbons. ""I'm too poor to give money and too old to hold a gun,"" Kristina explained, ""so I do what I can for the refugees. Partly, because I fear for my own tomorrow.""

Ukraine war: One shell that destroyed a family,2022-03-15T06:00:27.000Z,"""He was everything I could ever dream of, an example of what a man should be,"" says Maryna. ""He was the centre of our family, our fortress and our heart. He made my most secret dreams come true."" Maryna's husband of 34 years, Myhailo, was killed by Russian forces on 6 March, in the commuter town of Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv.  This is the story of one shell that hit one flat and destroyed one family, but almost three weeks into Russia's invasion there are countless other families like this across Ukraine. Maryna wants to tell her story for the sake of Myhailo, 54, and their son Serhiy, aged 32, who was also killed in the attack. Warning: Some readers may find details in this story distressing. We speak via video call, as Maryna is now sheltering with distant relatives in western Ukraine, along with her daughter Yanna and her grandson. The three-year-old is named Myhailo, after the grandfather he adored.  Maryna appears on my screen looking drawn and wearing black. And her words pour out, in a torrent of pain, grief and anger. ""When a person is killed somewhere, ""she tells me, ""the police look for the killer. There is a court case. The person is punished. Now it's not just one person being killed, it's many. The nation is being killed. I want the world to see who is doing this so that Putin and his regime bear the blame for the killing of my beloved ones."" When the Russians began targeting Irpin, Maryna, her husband and son left their flat and moved to her daughter's home nearby. On the day of the attack, repeated shelling drove them down to the underground car park. In the evening it was quieter, so they went up to the apartment on the 15th floor to collect some food and give her grandson a bath.  ""We did everything quickly, ""she said, ""then we heard a thunderclap. Myhailo and Serhiy pushed us away - me, my daughter and my grandson. We managed to get out, but they didn't. I felt whistling in my ears, and something hot on my skin. I didn't know what had happened, but I knew I was alive."" A shell had hit the bedroom of the flat, and blown it away, from corner to corner.  LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyKYIV: Ukraine generals on why Kyiv will not fall easilyIMPACT: One shell that destroyed a familyWATCH: Five times refugees were met with kindnessIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict Outside in the corridor she started calling for her family and found her daughter and grandson, by touch. They were scared but unharmed - saved by a mattress which fell on top of them. ""I started calling my husband and son,"" she says. ""I was calling 'Serhiy, Misha'. My son replied. I followed his voice and found the flat. My husband was at the front step. If he had made it just a few more inches, out of the flat, that would have saved his life. The entire concrete wall fell on him."" Serhiy was alive, just. ""My son was screaming 'Mum don't come here. Run! Run away from here and take Yanna and the baby with you."" I realised he could not move. I said: 'Darling please wait, I will come back for you.'"" Maryna, Yanna and little Myhailo felt their way downstairs through the smoke and dust - step by terrified step. Down in the car park she begged neighbours to help. ""The men went first, ""she said, ""in the blink of an eye. They came down and said someone was alive but there was nothing they could do. I asked for sheets and bandages and said I would go there myself,"" Maryna recounts.  ""A woman doctor came with me. We found my son, still fully conscious. His stomach was ripped open, and his legs were broken. He said 'Mum, I can't stand it. Kill me now. My son died in my arms, not asking for anything, just cursing Putin.""  Serhiy's plans died with him - his hopes of settling down and having a family. ""I will never be able to see my son's children,"" says Maryna. ""Putin did not just kill my son and my husband. He killed my family."" The bereft wife and mother has her own name for the Russian leader's ""special military operation"" as he calls it. She says it is a ""special shelling operation"". One house shelled might be a fluke, she argues, but not hundreds of houses all over Ukraine. She says the Russians targeted houses deliberately in Irpin.  ""The tanks moved from one place to another, to get the best view,"" she tells me. The 53-year-old angrily rejects Vladimir Putin's claim that his mission is to protect Russian speakers. ""He didn't need to rescue me,"" she says. ""I have never been oppressed. I have been speaking Russian all my life. I could travel. I could speak the language I wanted. I have started speaking Ukrainian as a form of protest (as have many others). Putin has taught me to love my homeland even more."" This is the second time Russia's long shadow has enveloped Maryna and her family. In 2014 she and Myhailo had just settled into their ""dream home"" in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, when Kremlin-backed rebels went to war with the Ukrainian government. They had to flee and settled in Irpin where history - or Russia's version of it - repeated itself.  In a bitter irony, many who fled the East started new lives in Irpin and neighbouring Bucha - both of which have suffered relentless Russian bombardment.  Maryna says each day is harder now, as her loss seeps through to the bone. ""You wake in the morning and the person you are closest to is not there, the one who always said, 'good morning' and made you a cup of coffee. There's no-one who can come and hug you if you aren't in a good mood.""  Myhailo was a mechanical engineer and adored his family. ""He was a father unlike many, perhaps because he spent all his time with his children,"" Maryna says. ""When the grandson was born, he was the same with him. He taught him so many things"". She says she and Myhailo were ""big dreamers"", always planning for the future. Now in place of dreams, there is gnawing worry for the family she has left.  ""My grandson doesn't know his grandfather and uncle have passed away,"" she says. ""He is afraid of noise. When he hears a sound, he asks if it's the bad guys shooting. I need to save my daughter and grandson and get them away from the war."" For a short time it seemed they had outrun the threat by getting to the city of Lviv, close to the Polish border. But early on Sunday morning it too was attacked, with a cruise missile strike killing 35 people at a military training base.  In Ukraine it is now safe to assume that nowhere is safe. Having been robbed of her husband and son, Maryna is begging Western nations to impose a no-fly zone. ""I am asking you to shield the sky over Ukraine,"" she says. ""Don't let them shoot at us. Ukraine is protecting all of Europe, and we will not manage this alone."" Ten days on, Irpin remains under fire, and most of the town's 60,000 residents have fled. Myhailo and Serhiy still lie unburied in the ruins of the flat - a torment for Maryna.  ""My husband and son are still in that room,"" she says. ""I could not bury them by myself. There is no funeral service, no doctors, and no morgue. I hope there is a way to bury them, with their names on the graves. I want there to be a cross, and I want to go to visit."" One shell, one flat and one family hold up a mirror to the brutality of Russia's invasion, and the agony of Ukraine."
Marina Ovsyannikova: Russian journalist tells of 14-hour interrogation,2022-03-15T20:13:02.000Z,"A Russian journalist has been fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme and made an anti-war video. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel 1, was detained after she ran on to the set on Monday holding a sign saying ""no war"". She said she had been questioned for 14 hours and not slept for two days, and was not given access to legal help. The 30,000 rouble (Â£214; $280) fine relates to her video message. She had pleaded not guilty to the charge of organising an unauthorised public event. In the video, she called on the Russian people to protest against the war, saying only they have the power to ""stop all this madness"".  ""Don't be afraid of anything. They can't imprison us all,"" she said. It is not clear if she will face separate charges relating to her protest on live TV, and there had been fears she would be prosecuted under a more serious, new criminal law that bans calling Russia's military action in Ukraine an ""invasion"" or spreading ""fake news"" about the conflict. After the court hearing Ms Ovsyannikova told reporters that she needed to rest after two days without sleep.  ""The interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours, I wasn't allowed to get in touch with my family or friends, I was denied access to a lawyer,"" she said.  She also stressed that she came up with the idea of the protest alone.  ""It was my anti-war decision. I made this decision by myself because I don't like Russia starting this invasion. It was really terrible,"" she said in English as she left the courthouse.  Lawyers were unable to locate Ms Ovsyannikova for several hours after she was detained on Monday evening. Her whereabouts were unknown until an image circulated on Russian media which showed her in court with lawyer Anton Gashinsky. Images of Ms Ovsyannikova's protest were quickly shared across the world after she ran on to the set of one of Russia's most-watched news programmes, Vremya, holding a sign reading ""No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here."" She could also be heard repeating the words ""no war, stop the war"".  The placard was clearly visible for a few seconds before the programme cut away from the live broadcast to a pre-recorded report.  Before the incident she recorded a video in which she said she was ashamed to work for what she called Kremlin propaganda. ""I'm ashamed that I allowed myself to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed Russians to be turned into zombies,"" she explained. ""We just silently watched this inhumane regime."" Ms Ovsyannikova, who said her father was Ukrainian, said the whole world had turned against Russia.  ""The next 10 generations won't be able to clean themselves from the shame of this fratricidal war."" Her colleagues at Channel 1 were reportedly surprised by her actions. One told the Faridaily blog - run by former BBC Russian Service journalist Farida Rustamova - that Ms Ovsyannikova, who has two children, had never discussed politics, but spoke ""mostly about children, dogs and the house"". From the moment her identity became known, Ms Ovsyannikova received dozens of comments on her Facebook page in Ukrainian, Russian and English, thanking her for her actions.  Ukraine's President Zelensky also praised her for ""telling the truth"". French President Emmanuel Macron said France would launch an effort to offer her protection, either at the embassy or through asylum, and said he would discuss it in his next conversation with President Putin.   But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called her actions an act of ""hooliganism"".

It is also unusual for employees of state-controlled news organisations to express an opinion that differs from the official Kremlin position.  But since the war in Ukraine began, at least three journalists have resigned from top Russian TV channels: Zhanna Agalakova from Channel 1, and Lilia Gildeyeva and Vadim Glusker from NTV.  State-controlled Russian media refer to the war as a ""special military operation"" and paint Ukraine as the aggressor, describing Ukraine's elected government as neo-Nazis.  Several of the remaining independent media outlets in Russia have stopped broadcasting or publishing after pressure from the authorities, including the radio station Echo of Moscow, and TV Rain - an online TV channel.  Others, like newspaper Novaya Gazeta, are attempting to report on the situation without falling foul of the new censorship laws. Access to the BBC has also been restricted inside Russia, leading the corporation to issue guidance over how to continue using its services.  Many social media sites have also been blocked, further restricting the number and diversity of news sources available to people inside Russia. "

Ms Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said she understood British negotiators were in the Iranian capital. She met Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard for ""yet another strategy meeting"" on Tuesday - saying she hoped there would not be many more. What is Nazanin's case about?Richard Ratcliffe ends hunger strike after 21 days Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe loses Iran appeal'My wife has been used as a bargaining chip' Mr Johnson said during a visit to Abu Dhabi that talks with Iran over Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release were ""moving forward"". He said he would not comment further ""because those negotiations continue to be under way and we're going right up to the wire"". The prime minister also said negotiations for the release of dual nationals in Tehran had been going on ""for a long time"". According to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's employer the Thomson Reuters Foundation, her lawyer Hojjat Kermani has said he is ""hopeful that we will have good news soon"". A Â£400m debt relating to a cancelled order for 1,500 Chieftain tanks dating back to the 1970s had been linked to the continued detention of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other UK-Iranian dual nationals held in the country - although the government has said the two issues should not be linked. Downing Street said it was committed to paying the debt and was ""exploring options to resolve it"", but said it had not been resolved. A Foreign Office spokesman said it continued to ""explore options"" to resolve the debt but would not comment further as discussions were ongoing. He added the Foreign Office would not comment on speculation about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe but had long called for the release of ""unfairly detained British nationals in Iran"". Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt - who has campaigned for her release - said it was traditional for clemency to be shown to some prisoners to coincide with Persian New Year, Nowruz.  This year's festival falls this Sunday so Mr Hunt said it could be ""a very, very critical next few days"".  Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 43, who has always denied the charges against her, was first jailed for five years in 2016 after being accused of plotting against the regime - spending the last year of her sentence under house arrest at her parents' home. After that sentence expired she was then sentenced to another year's confinement in April 2021 on charges of ""spreading propaganda"", which has been served at her parents' house in Tehran. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe, who lives with their daughter Gabriella in Hampstead, London, has campaigned for her release, including by going on hunger strike in October last year. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sister-in-law Rebecca Ratcliffe told BBC Radio 5 live there had been ""so many false hopes"" over the last five or six years so it was hard to tell ""if this is a really positive sign or just the Iranian government playing games again"". She said her sister-in-law was on edge when things like this happened because she did not want to get her hopes up. ""We have everything crossed, but remain sceptical,"" she said.  Her mother-in-law, Barbara Ratcliffe, told the BBC Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe ""seemed really quite upbeat when I last spoke to her"", but added that the family was ""all a bit battle-scarred"", having had disappointments in the past. Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK's chief executive, warned the latest reports should be treated with caution as there had been ""false dawn after false dawn"" in the long-running process. And Rupert Skilbeck, director of the Redress human rights organisation, echoed such sentiments. ""We remain cautious and continue to encourage the UK government to do the right thing and ensure the debt it owes to Iran is paid, and that it does everything in its power to secure Nazanin's release,"" he said. There are other Western passport holders detained by Iran including Anoosheh Ashoori, a retired civil engineer from London, who was convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency in 2019.

Ukraine war: Zelensky urges Russian troops to surrender,2022-03-15T12:06:54.000Z,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on Russian soldiers to surrender. In his nightly TV address, he said Russian forces had suffered worse losses during their invasion of his country than in the Chechnya conflict.  He said they had already begun to understand that they would not achieve anything by war. ""I know that you want to survive,"" he said, adding that those who surrendered would be treated ""as people, decently"".  Mr Zelensky also paid tribute to Marina Ovsyannikova, the woman who interrupted Russian state TV news by holding up an anti-war sign. He said he was ""grateful to those Russians who do not stop trying to convey the truth"" and who fought disinformation. Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine are expected to continue on Tuesday, with Mr Zelensky saying ""pretty good"" progress had been made so far. Later, in a video call to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and representatives from the multinational Joint Expeditionary Force, the Ukrainian leader once again berated Nato over its refusal to implement a no-fly zone. Mr Zelensky said Nato was ""the strongest alliance in the world"" but ""some of the members of this alliance are hypnotised by Russian aggression"". He added that Vladimir Putin's invasion had undermined European security infrastructure and that fears of World War Three were allowing Russia to bombard peaceful cities. In another diplomatic move, the Polish, Czech and Slovenian prime ministers are on their way by train to Kyiv to meet Mr Zelensky. The Polish government said in a statement that the visit was intended ""to confirm the unequivocal support of the entire European Union for the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine and to present a broad package of support for the Ukrainian state and society"". However, authorities in the beleaguered capital have announced a 35-hour curfew to begin at 20:00 local time on Tuesday. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said it would last until 07:00 on Thursday, adding that it came at ""a difficult and dangerous moment"".

Therefore, he said, he was offering them a choice on behalf of the Ukrainian people. ""If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently.  ""In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours. Choose!""

Camelot to lose licence to run National Lottery,2022-03-15T09:20:39.000Z,"The company that has run the National Lottery since it was launched, Camelot, has lost out on the next licence. The Gambling Commission has announced Allwyn Entertainment Ltd as its preferred applicant for the lottery's next licence, which starts in 2024. It said it had received the highest number of applications to run the National lottery since the first licence was awarded in 1994. Camelot has been named as the ""reserve applicant"" after four firms applied. The National Lottery is one of the world's largest lotteries and has raised more than Â£45bn for 660,000 causes across the UK. It has also played a part in funding training and facilities over the past three decades for Great Britain's Olympic and Paralympic athletes. Coming for Camelot: The battle to land the lottery Allwyn is a UK-based subsidiary of Europe's largest lottery operator Sazka, which is owned by Czech oil and gas tycoon Karel Komarek. It signalled its intent to run the National Lottery by launching in early 2021. Its board includes former members of the London 2012 Olympics organising committee, Lord Coe and entrepreneur Sir Keith Mills, who sit on its advisory board. In a statement, Allwyn said its proposal was ""judged to be the best way of growing returns to good causes by revitalising the National Lottery in a safe and sustainable way"". ""The appointment of Allwyn will breathe fresh life into the National Lottery,"" it added. Camelot chief executive Nigel Railton said: ""I'm incredibly disappointed by today's announcement, but we still have a critical job to do - as our current licence runs until February 2024. ""We're now carefully reviewing the Gambling Commission's evaluation before deciding on our next steps."" The Gambling Commission said it was ""satisfied"" that no application had been impacted by sanctions imposed by Western nations in relation to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Our priority was to run a competition that would attract a strong field of candidates. Having received the most applications since 1994, it is clear that we've achieved just that,"" said Andrew Rhodes, the Gambling Commission's chief executive. ""I am confident that the success of the competition will lead to a highly successful fourth licence - one that maximises returns to good causes, promotes innovation, delivers against our statutory duties, and which ultimately protects the unique status of the National Lottery."""
Cost of living: 'My pay isn't keeping up with rising prices',2022-03-15T10:40:20.000Z,"UK wage growth failed to keep up with the rising cost of living between November and January, new figures show. Wages rose, but when taking rising prices into account, regular pay showed a 1% fall from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. Gamu Nyasoro, a senior registered nurse, told the BBC that despite a recent pay rise, she has barely noticed a difference in her income after bills. There is concern the Ukraine war will further push up energy and food bills. The new employment figures also show that the number of jobless people in the UK has dropped below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said there were 1.34 million unemployed in the three months to January, below the 1.36 million recorded in December to February 2020.  The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in the most recent quarter, while job vacancies hit another record high. But according to the ONS, employees' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 3.8% between November and January from a year earlier.  However, the rising cost of food, energy and household goods has pushed inflation, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, to a 30-year high. Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, increasing pressure on household budgets. The Resolution Foundation think tank has warned that the squeeze on workers will get worse, with those on the lowest incomes most likely to be affected by surging bills. Why are prices rising so quickly?Borrow billions or see incomes hit, Sunak toldFury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise The ONS said its latest figures showed the number of unemployed people fell below pre-pandemic levels for the first time, while there was another strong rise in the number of pay-rolled employees in February. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, added: ""However, the number of people out of work and not looking for a job rose again, meaning total employment remained well below its pre-pandemic level. ""We have seen yet another record number of job vacancies, and with the redundancy rate falling to a new record low, demand for workers remains strong."" The ONS said early estimates for February 2022 indicated that median monthly pay was Â£2,041, an increase of 5.1% compared with the same period last year. ""The issue is not that pay growth is weak, it's that prices are running even higher,"" Mr Fitzner told the BBC's Today programme. Recent research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested that public sector workers in particular are facing pay cuts once rising prices are taken into account. Gamu Nyasoro, says her pay rise is barely noticeable once increasing council tax, energy and food bills are taken into account. As a single mother to three children, a lot of her outgoings are spent on childcare. ""I look at my pay cheque and you literally want to cry because you know that by day two, the things that you need to pay have gone out and you are literally left with no money."" She says finances are now a constant worry. Her forecast energy bill for the next year has nearly doubled. She was recently also forced to use a foodbank for the first time. ""It was one of the most scariest thing that I've done and something that I didn't do lightly.""  You can't sugar-coat this. It's been widely predicted that living standards would fall as a result of rising inflation. Before inflation, the average pay rise was 3.8% excluding bonuses - substantially more than most workers have been used to over the past decade.  However, because prices are now rising faster than that, the average wage (now Â£555 per week) can buy fewer goods and services than a year ago. After allowing for inflation, it amounts to a real terms pay cut of 1% across the board.  That average hides a growing gap between the private sector, where bonuses have lifted total pay by 5.3% including bonuses, enough to keep up with the rising cost of living, and the public sector, where total pay rose by only 2.4% and living standards are falling more sharply.  We've only just got over the worst decade for improvements in living standards in 200 years. Now, once again, living standards for most workers are falling. And that's before what's anticipated in the coming weeks - a rise in interest rates, rising energy bills and higher taxes.  Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation, said: ""Rising prices and the energy cap increase in April will affect all households across the UK, but it will acutely impact those in low paying and insecure employment."" He called on the chancellor to use the Spring Statement on 23 March to support those most at risk by, for example, increasing Universal Credit payments. The British Chamber of Commerce suggested that Rishi Sunak should use the Spring Statement to delay a planned rise in National Insurance contributions by one year, to give firms a bit of financial headroom in the face of rising costs. Responding to the new figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I am confident that our labour market is in a good position to deal with the current global challenges. ""We know people are concerned about the rising cost of living so alongside continuing to help people find great jobs - we're providing direct support worth more than Â£20bn this financial year and next."" Other experts also suggested that action was needed to help older people in particular. Separate research published by the ONS shows that a significant number of older workers have dropped out of the workforce for a mix of reasons, such as long-term sickness or those taking early retirement. However, some analysts said the strength in the labour market overall meant the Bank of England was likely to increase interest rates on Thursday. Martin Beck of the EY Item Club said the Bank might be worried that a tight jobs market could see workers asking for higher wages to off-set budget pressures. Earlier this year, the Bank's governor came under fire for suggesting that workers should not ask for big pay rises, to try to stop prices rising out of control."
Roman Abramovich: Sanctions restrict rent payments to Crown Estate,2022-03-15T12:59:58.000Z,"The UK sanctions against Roman Abramovich have restricted rent payments to the Crown Estate, which manages properties owned by the Queen. The UK government froze Mr Abramovich's assets last week as part of its sanctions response to the Ukraine war. He and other wealthy Russians have been targeted to put pressure on President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions prevent them from making transactions related to their properties and businesses in the UK. Mr Abramovich's frozen assets include Chelsea FC, which was allowed to continue operating under a special licence granted by the UK government. The 55-year-old Russian billionaire, who has denied close ties to President Putin, has also been linked to the ownership of properties in the UK. They include a 15-bedroom mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens, an exclusive street known as ""billionaires' row"" in west London. Land records show companies that manage assets for Mr Abramovich are registered as the lease owners of the property. This means the companies own the home, but the land it was built on belongs to the Crown Estate - a business created by Parliament to oversee a portfolio of the British monarch's properties. The Queen is not involved in management decisions by the Crown Estate, which is tasked with generating profit for the government. The terms of the lease require the companies to pay the Crown Estate ""Â£10,000 rising to Â£160,000"" over a 125-year term, a Land Registry document shows. RAbramovich sanctioned by UKChelsea owner disqualified as club directorWho are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? When asked about the impact of sanctions on Mr Abramovich, a spokesperson for the Crown Estate said they would not comment on the details of individual leases. But condemning the invasion of Ukraine, the spokesperson said: ""We are doing all we can to comply swiftly with the introduction of sanctions."" The BBC has requested comment from a spokesperson for Mr Abramovich. The restrictions on rent payments were first reported by the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which said Mr Abramovich bought the house for $140m (Â£107m) in 2011.  Built in the mid-1800s, the Grade II listed building hosted a Soviet diplomatic mission in 1972 and is across the road from Kensington Palace. Last week the UK government imposed travel bans and full asset freezes on ""seven of Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs"", including Mr Abramovich. These measures prohibit anyone in the UK from dealing with frozen assets owned, held or controlled by a sanctioned person. Legal experts said Mr Abramovich would have to apply for licences to make any transactions related to his properties - from security services and utility bills, to maintenance and gardeners. A licence is a written permission from the Treasury allowing an act that would otherwise breach financial sanctions. The special licence granted to Chelsea FC is one example. A Treasury spokesperson said the department cannot comment on specific properties. In general, though, a sanctioned person who is subject to an asset freeze can still live in their house but cannot rent or sell it, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said they can ""apply for a licence on the grounds of 'basic needs', which can cover things like payment of insurance, property management, rent or mortgage payments, utility charges"". ""The licence would enable their bank to release those specific payments without contravening the freeze."" Joshua Ray, a lawyer for Rahman Ravelli, told the BBC that licence applications ""can often take at least several weeks if not longer"". ""With respect to licences related to Chelsea, the government has signalled a willingness to put applications on a fast track, but that doesn't appear to apply to his other UK assets,"" said Mr Ray, who advises international companies on sanctions. Treasury guidance says lawyers advising a sanctioned person ""cannot receive any payment"" for that service without a licence. Mr Ray said Mr Abramovich ""would likely need to engage a lawyer located in a jurisdiction where he is not yet sanctioned"". On Sunday, Housing Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme the government was looking at using the properties of Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the UK for ""humanitarian purposes"". But he said there was ""quite a high legal bar to cross and we're not talking about permanent confiscation, adding ""if we can use it in order to help others let's do that""."

Wilko sorry for saying staff could work with Covid,2022-03-15T10:10:21.000Z,"Retail chain Wilko has apologised for ""some miscommunication"" in which it told staff they could continue to work if they tested positive for Covid. In a memo, reported by The Mirror, the company said staff with the virus could continue to work in stores if they felt well enough to.  Wilko confirmed the memo was sent out and the firm has since made a U-turn. ""When we get something wrong, we hold our hands up, admit it, and work to correct the situation,"" the firm said. Jerome Saint-Marc, Wilko chief executive, said he wanted to ""reassure all our customers and team members"" that the company's advice to staff with Covid symptoms or those who test positive was to stay at home and avoid contact with others. ""As throughout our 92 years on the High Street, the safety and wellbeing of our shoppers and teams is at the heart of our business and we're truly sorry for any understandable concerns our communications may have raised,"" he added. People with Covid in England are no longer legally required to self-isolate with all restrictions now removed, but it is still recommended. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people are still asked to self-isolate after a positive test. What are the new self-isolation rules?Covid: 'I will still ask my staff to isolate' In Wilko's initial memo to staff, the company, which has 414 stores in the UK, said: ""If you test positive for Covid-19 and feel well you can continue to come to work, if you feel too unwell you can follow the absence policy."" The removal of all legal Covid rules has made the decision over whether to self-isolate or not an individual one. It has led to concern that lower-paid staff face the toughest choice when deciding to isolate or not, with up to two million workers not qualifying for sick pay due to the amount they earn. The Trades Union Congress has said people should not be forced into making a ""terrible choice"" over going into work with Covid or risking losing income by self-isolating at home.

What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?,2022-03-24T11:41:20.000Z,"Measures designed to damage Russia's economy have been introduced by countries opposed to its invasion of Ukraine. This has led to higher prices for Russian households and shortages of some goods.  Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop it acting aggressively, or breaking international law. They are among the toughest actions nations can take, short of going to war. Military goods and mercenaries A ban on the export of dual-use goods - items with both a civilian and military purpose, such as vehicle parts - has been imposed by the UK, EU and US. This is reportedly having an impact on some Russian manufacturers.  Ukraine says Russia's main armoured vehicle factory has run out of parts to make and repair tanks. It also says a tractor plant has stopped production because of a shortage of foreign-made parts. The UK is also imposing sanctions on Russia's Wagner Group - a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military. Flights All Russian flights have been banned from US, UK, EU and Canadian airspace.  The UK has also banned private jets chartered by Russians.  Luxury goods The UK says it will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia - including vehicles, high-end fashion and art. The EU has already imposed a ban.  The UK will also put a 35% tax on some imports from Russia, including vodka.  Targeting individuals The US, EU and UK have together sanctioned over 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses, including wealthy business leaders known as oligarchs, who are considered close to the Kremlin. One high-profile oligarch sanctioned by the UK is Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich.  Assets belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov are also being frozen in the US, EU, UK and Canada. However, many Russian oligarchs have put their properties and wealth under other names, which means they may be beyond the reach of the UK's sanctions.  The UK is also limiting the sale of ""golden visas"", which allowed wealthy Russians to get British residency rights. The hunt for superyachts of sanctioned Russians Oil and gas The US is banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. The EU, which gets a quarter of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia, says it will switch to alternative supplies and make Europe independent from Russian energy ""well before 2030"". Germany has put on hold permission for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to open.  Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas? Financial measures Western countries have frozen the assets of Russia's central bank, to stop it using its $630bn (Â£470bn) of foreign currency reserves. This has caused the value of the rouble to slump by 22% since the start of the year. That, in turn, has pushed up the price of imported goods and led to a 14% rise in Russia's rate of inflation.  Some Russian banks are being removed from the international financial messaging system Swift, which is used to transfer money across borders. This will delay payments to Russia for energy exports. Other UK sanctions include:  major Russian banks excluded from the UK financial systemall Russian banks have had their assets frozenthe Russian state and major companies are not be able to raise finance or borrow money in the UKa limit placed on deposits Russians can make at UK banks The EU also said it would target 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned firms. A growing number of international companies including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks have suspended trading in Russia.  After facing fierce criticism for continuing to operate in Russia, Nestle has withdrawn some of its brands including KitKat and Nesquik, but will still sell ""essential foods"". However, a number of other Western brands including Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor say they can't pull out from Russia because their businesses there operate under complex franchise deals.  Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Russia's President Putin has said he will make ""unfriendly"" nations pay for their imports of Russian gas in roubles, which would push up the value of the currency. Russia has banned exports of more than 200 products until the end of 2022, including telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, electrical equipment and timber. In addition it is blocking interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds, and banning Russian firms from paying overseas shareholders. It has stopped foreign investors who hold billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds from selling them. Could Russia turn to China as sanctions bite?"
Couple injured in Alton Towers Smiler crash to marry,2022-03-15T11:16:56.000Z,"A couple seriously injured in a rollercoaster crash at Alton Towers have announced their engagement. Leah Washington and Joe Pugh were both teenagers riding the Smiler when it crashed in 2015. Leah's leg was later amputated and Joe had shattered knees. Leah showed off her engagement ring in a photo from Venice on her Instagram page. She received thousands of likes and wrote: ""So this happened yesterdayâ¦ I SAID YES."" Joe wrote on his Instagram page ""What a great end to a long weekend in Veniceâ¦ SHE SAID YES""  The pair, from Barnsley in South Yorkshire, were among 16 people hurt in the crash, five of them seriously, when two carriages on the ride collided in June that year. An investigation by the Staffordshire theme park in November 2015 found it had been caused by human error. Theme park owner Merlin admitted breaching the Health and Safety Act and was fined Â£5m in September 2016. Leah and Vicky Balch, of Leyland, Lancashire, who also lost a leg as a result of the crash, later announced they were suing Merlin for negligence and or breach of statutory duty.

Ukraine: Nick Robinson on how Germany is reversing decades of closer ties with Russia,2022-03-15T10:51:50.000Z,"Just over three decades ago I stood on top of the Berlin Wall which - for almost three decades before - had torn friends and families apart, split a country and set the division of Europe in concrete.   I watched and held my breath with thousands of others on that heady night in November 1989, when one brave young man dared to jump off the wall into what had been ""no man's land"".  Days earlier he would have been shot, joining all those who had paid with their lives for daring to try to bridge the gap between East and West. Not on the night the wall fell. He held out a flower to a bewildered-looking East German soldier who, after a pause that seemed to last a lifetime, held out his hand and accepted the gesture of peace. The crowd lining the wall cheered wildly.   They - we - dreamt that Europe might now be ""free and whole"". People might soon be free to choose who governed them - whether they lived in Berlin or Prague, Warsaw or Budapest and perhaps, just perhaps, in Moscow and St Petersburg too.   I am back in Berlin - a city facing up to the fact that that dream is now dead thanks to Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine and to bomb its people into submission.  Germany's leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, spoke of this being a historic turning point. In German they have a word for it (they have a word for everything). It is zeitenwende.  Mr Scholz announced his country would now offer real military aid to Ukraine. A few weeks before, his government had been mocked for its offer of 5,000 helmets to equip the Ukrainian army. The head of the German navy had to resign after he observed that all Mr Putin wanted was respect and that he probably deserved it.    The German chancellor has now pledged to spend more - â¬100bn (Â£84bn) more - on defence. What that means is that this country will soon become the biggest military power in Europe and the third biggest in the world - behind only China and the United States.  Not so very long ago, that prospect would have been greeted with fear abroad and protests at home.   As a young man - a member of what he calls ""the 1989 generation"" - Nils Schmid studied in Ukraine in what was then part of the Soviet Union. These days, he is a German MP and foreign affairs spokesman for the governing Social Democrats. He told me he and his fellow countrymen and women now had to accept that the ""iron curtain"" which divided Europe had simply moved.  Once it had stood a few hundred yards from his office. Now, long after the fall of the wall, it is on the border between Nato countries - whose defence is guaranteed by the US - and those who look to Moscow.  Opposite his office stands the vast Russia embassy - in what used to be East Berlin. It is now protected by police and there are barricades decorated with anti-war posters. A blanket lies on the ground and is filled with soft toys. The message to passers by is that it could be your children dying in Ukraine.   There, I met Michael - a biker from the Black Forest in south-west Germany. He was recording a video next to his Yamaha, which he had re-painted in the blue and yellow colours of the Ukrainian flag. He had ridden for eight hours carrying a folder bulging with 600 messages to Vladimir Putin - from friends, neighbours and colleagues calling on the Russian president to stop the war.  The embassy staff had refused to accept it. Michael had come to realise that talking to Russia (what used to be called detente) was not enough. Germany now had to be prepared to confront Moscow.   What that means is the children of that 1989 generation will not enjoy the same freedoms as their parents. They will not grow up believing that wars are what happened in the past. Indeed a recent poll showed that seven in 10 Germans fear the spread of this war.  And no wonder. The refugees driven from their homes by this conflict are pouring off trains into Berlin's stations at a rate of, some say, 10,000 a day.   This war is re-shaping how Europe's most powerful country thinks. That will have dramatic consequences which are only just beginning to be thought through.   You have to be almost 40 years old to remember the day when the wall fell back in November 1989. These days of February and March 2022 are turning out to be just as consequential.

Ukraine war: Infection and hunger as hundreds hide in Mariupol cellar,2022-03-15T15:39:28.000Z,"Hundreds of people are crammed into the basement of a large public building in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, but are running out of food, with many also in need of urgent medical help.   ""Some have developed sepsis from shrapnel in the body,"" said Anastasiya Ponomareva, a 39-year-old teacher who fled the city at the start of the war but was still in contact with friends there. ""Things are very serious."" The city is encircled by Russian troops and remains under constant bombardment with almost 400,000 people still trapped without running water, and food and medical supplies quickly running out. The local authorities say the war there has left at least 2,400 civilians dead, but even they acknowledge that this is an underestimate. Ms Ponomareva's friends are with other families in the basement of the building. They have all left homes that are no longer safe or no longer standing. ""People who managed to hide in underground shelters basically live there permanently,"" Ms Ponomareva said from the western city of Drohobych, where she was living. ""They practically cannot leave at all.""  Most of their day is spent hiding in the basement. From time to time they go upstairs for some sunlight, but rarely outside. Conditions, she was told, were quickly deteriorating, as some people had a fever and nothing could be done to treat them. ""There is no medical help, no antibiotics.""  Some streets are so dangerous that few go out to pick up the dead. Many are being buried in mass graves. The almost non-stop Russian attacks have turned their old neighbourhoods into wasteland. New drone footage (pictured above) showed the vast extent of the damage, with fire and smoke billowing out of apartment blocks and blackened streets in ruins.  ""On the left bank, there's no residential building intact, it's all burned to the ground,"" Ms Ponomareva said. ""The city centre is unrecognisable."" Sheltering in the same building, a family of four has been in touch with Serhii Kozyrkov, a 40-year-old pastor who left Mariupol two weeks ago. ""It's very crowded and there isn't enough food,"" Mr Kozyrkov, who is now in Lviv, said. ""People get ill because it's very cold and everyone is lying next to each other."" The family are desperate to flee. On Tuesday, about 2,000 cars managed to exit Mariupol, the city council said, and 2,000 more were ready to go. It was the second day that residents were allowed to leave. Previous evacuation attempts had failed, with Ukrainian authorities accusing Russia of attacking the city and even routes to be used by civilians, despite agreeing to ceasefires. But, again, no humanitarian aid was allowed into the city. Sergei Orlov, the deputy mayor of Mariupol, said things were ""getting more difficult by the hour"".  ""The situation is horrible,"" he said. ""There isn't enough food, water, medicine, insulin, baby food. Everyone has specific needs."" According to Mr Orlov, cars with supplies have been waiting for four days but the Russians have not let it in. ""We get a lot of calls. For example, a mother who says 'I have a child in my hands [who] is dying from hunger.' Or we get a call 'Here's our address. We're blocked in the basement. What should we do?',"" Mr Orlov said. ""Unfortunately,"" he said, ""we can't do anything."" Back in the basement, the family told Mr Kozyrkov they could hear the sound of explosions nearby but that their building remained intact. There is one generator which they use to recharge their phones and, from time to time, they venture outside to make some calls. ""The shelling doesn't stop,"" he said. ""They're very frightened."" Ms Ponomareva said the situation was ""very difficult, to put it mildly."" People need a humanitarian corridor, she said. ""Otherwise, it's a slow death from hunger and thirst.""

Star Hobson murder: Frankie Smith's sentence increased to 12 years,2022-03-15T14:49:57.000Z,"The mother of murdered toddler Star Hobson has had her sentence for causing or allowing her daughter's death increased to 12 years. Frankie Smith, 20, was handed an eight-year term at Bradford Crown Court in December. Attorney General Suella Braverman said this was ""unduly lenient"" and referred the sentence to the Court of Appeal. Three senior judges considered the case and extended the original term by four years. A seven-week trial heard Star had endured a campaign of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Smith and her partner, Savannah Brockhill, 28, who was jailed for a minimum of 25 years for the toddler's murder. The original sentencing hearing was told Star was ""caught in the crossfire"" of the pair's toxic relationship, resulting in her death at 16 months old from ""catastrophic"" blunt-force injuries. As she delivered the Court of Appeal's ruling, Lady Justice Sharp said Smith's original sentence was unduly lenient because it ""did not reflect the overall seriousness of the offending"". She said Smith had shown a ""deliberate disregard"" for her daughter's welfare and had failed to take any steps to protect her, treating the toddler with ""callous indifference"", cruelty and neglect. She said Smith had failed to contact the police or social services, seek medical attention or help from family members - some of whom had reported their concerns to social services after seeing Star with bruises. Star was ""particularly vulnerable due to her very young age"", the judge said, and Smith had been a neglectful parent who had remained in the relationship with Brockhill for her own ""selfish"" gains.  Sitting alongside Mr Justice Sweeney and Mr Justice Jeremy Baker, she said the sentencing judge had been wrong to hand Smith a lesser sentence based on mitigation such as being a victim of domestic abuse and the fact she had lost her daughter. ""In our judgment no less a sentence than 12 years would meet the justice of this case,"" Mrs Justice Sharp said. Tom Little QC, representing the Attorney General's Office, told the court the defendant had participated in ""degradation of Star and sadistic behaviour"". ""This was not a case where the offender was so racked with guilt and pleaded guilty at the very first opportunity,"" he said. Mr Little further argued Star's vulnerability and a delay in calling 999 on the day of her death were not taken into account by sentencing judge Mrs Justice Lambert. Smith's barrister Zafar Ali QC said it was ""simply incorrect"" to say she was not remorseful, and that she ""broke down several occasions during the crown's case in the trial"". He said the case had been ""permeated by domestic violence"" and instances of physical abuse against Smith by Brockhill, whom he described as ""a very intimidating character"". Star Hobson's babysitter: My warnings were ignoredThe short life and death of a beloved toddlerWoman guilty of murdering partner's toddler  Speaking before the hearing, Star's great-grandfather David Fawcett said: ""It doesn't matter what sentence she gets, it'll never bring Star back."" He told BBC News he had been visiting Smith in prison and was the only family member who had visited recently. ""I've been to see Frankie last Sunday and she's not doing good,"" he said.  His partner Anita Smith, who made one of the five referrals to social services, was still devastated over Star's loss, along with the rest of the family, he said. ""Anita says she'll never be able to face seeing Frankie and can never forgive her. She says she could've got away from the situation."" Hollie Jones, who would regularly babysit Star and made the first referral in January 2020, said she was pleased with the outcome. ""No sentence will feel like justice but I'm glad that it's been increased and I'm happy with the sentence she's got,"" she said. The Attorney General welcomed the judge's decision and said: ""This is a tragic and extremely upsetting case and my thoughts are with all those who loved Star Hobson.  ""This case involved prolonged and multiple cruelty and neglect, deliberate disregard, and a failure to take any steps to protect or seek assistance for her before and after her murder.""

Ukraine war: Russia's ex-president among 370 new UK sanctions targets,2022-03-15T18:11:58.000Z,"The UK has announced 370 more sanctions, with Russia's former president one of those targeted, in its latest response to the war in Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev and President Vladimir Putin's spokesman are among those to be hit with asset freezes and travel bans. Earlier, the UK hit Russia with trade restrictions, including an additional 35% tariff on vodka. The move comes after the passage of new legislation to speed up and harden UK sanctions. The government fast-tracked the Economic Crime Act through Parliament after criticism that UK had been too slow to target Russians with links to President Putin. The legislation allows the UK to sanction those who have had their assets frozen by the EU, US or Canada, and take action to stop wealthy Russians using London for money laundering. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee of MPs, which oversees the UK's intelligence community, said it hoped the new legislation was ""at least the first step"" in helping authorities ensure the UK is ""no longer a safe haven for the oligarchy and their enablers"". But a statement from the committee said it had made it clear two years ago in its report on Russian interference in British politics that the UK had been ""welcoming Russian money for many years with few questions - if any - being asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth"", and urgent action had been needed then.  What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions?How sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu were among the other high-profile allies of President Putin to be sanctioned by the UK. Others include Mr Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who the UK government called ""Russian propagandists"". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK was ""going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin"".  ""We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia's crimes in Ukraine,"" she said. ""Working closely with our allies, we will keep increasing the pressure on Putin and cut off funding for the Russian war machine."" A growing number of Russians have been sanctioned by the UK and its western allies since President Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been issuing increasingly frank pleas for stronger sanctions and western military intervention as Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities exact an ever-higher death toll. In a video call with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Mr Zelensky said ""we can still stop the Russian war machine"" and it was vital to do so because otherwise ""they will come for you"". Last week, the UK imposed asset freezes and travel bans on Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich and 386 Russian MPs who voted to recognise two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine as independent. A further wave of sanctions was announced on Tuesday morning in co-ordination with the European Union. They related to trade with Russia and included a 35% import tariff hike on Russian vodka and hundreds of other goods worth Â£900m. The latest package of UK sanctions was targeted at individuals and organisations with links to President Putin's administration. Some of them had already been sanctioned by western allies, among them Mr Mishustin and Mr Peskov, described by the US as ""a top purveyor of Putin's propaganda"". The UK was quicker to sanction others such as Mr Abramovich, who was blacklisted by the EU on Tuesday and accused of ""benefitting from Russian decision-makers"" responsible for destabilising Ukraine. A prominent name on the UK's latest list of sanctioned individuals was Mr Medvedev. Currently deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia since 2020, Mr Medvedev served as president from 2008 to 2012 and as prime minister from 2012 to 2020. Once regarded as more liberal than President Putin, Mr Medvedev warned western nations against sanctions in a tweet earlier this month. Do not forget, he wrote, ""that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones"". The UK government has been accused of moving too slowly on sanctions against Russians with links to President Putin. Opposition parties were worried a delay in imposing them meant some could move many of their assets out of the UK before they were frozen. The Economic Crime Act received royal assent in the early hours of Tuesday morning. It has given ministers the power to go further, and quickly sanction those who had been targeted already by the EU and the US. Ministers had expressed frustration about the process for sanctioning individuals under previous legislation. The Economic Crime Act should remove some of the difficulties around building legal cases to justify sanctions under UK law. The UK government also said Russian oligarchs with a combined estimated worth of more than Â£100bn were added to its sanctions list. On the list was billionaire Mikhail Fridman, founder of Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia. He lives in London and has business interests in the UK. At a London press conference on 1 March, he said while the Ukraine war was a ""huge tragedy"", sanctioning oligarchs would not sway President Putin. Some of the other oligarchs sanctioned by the UK included: German Khan, a business partner of Mr Fridman in Alfa Bank, with an estimated net worth of Â£7.8bnPetr Aven, a former president of Alfa Bank, with an estimated net worth of Â£4bnAlexey Mordaschov, a majority shareholder in steel company Severstal, with an estimated net worth of Â£22.4bnAndrey Melnichenko, the founder of EuroChem Group, with an estimated net worth of Â£13.7bn For Labour, shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""Urgent sanctions have been needed so that Putin and his inner circle cannot live a Mayfair lifestyle in Moscow while committing atrocities in Ukraine. ""The government now needs to ensure that the export ban has no loopholes so it has maximum impact.""

Abramovich: Jet linked to oligarch lands in Moscow,2022-03-15T12:50:34.000Z,"A private jet linked to sanctioned billionaire Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich has landed in Moscow.  The jet arrived in Moscow on Tuesday morning after taking off from Israel and stopping in Istanbul, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 said. Mr Abramovich was seen in a VIP lounge at the airport in Israel, though it is not known if he boarded the flight. The Russian was among seven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government last week in response to the Ukraine war.  Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. Secret paper highlights corrupt Abramovich dealsRoman Abramovich sanctioned by UKWho are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Reuters news agency said it had obtained a photograph showing Mr Abramovich in a VIP lounge in Ben Gurion Airport in Lod near Tel Aviv on Monday. It is not known whether he boarded the jet at any stage on its journey from Israel to Istanbul and subsequently from Istanbul to Moscow. Mr Abramovich has Israeli and Portuguese citizenship. A rabbi who helped him gain citizenship in Portugal was detained on Thursday as part of an investigation into how that citizenship was granted. Meanwhile, sources have told the BBC that the European Union is set to include Mr Abramovich on its expanded list of oligarchs who are subject to EU asset freezes. Under UK sanctions, Mr Abramovich and the other six oligarchs - including billionaires Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska - have been banned from entering or remaining in the UK.  Some of his assets were frozen, including Chelsea FC, though the club has been allowed to continue operating under a special licence granted by the UK government.  Mr Abramovich announced he was selling the club earlier this month, before the sanctions against him were introduced. He is also believed to own a number of properties in the UK, including a 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens in west London, reportedly valued at more than Â£150m. His purchase of Chelsea FC in 2003 transformed the club's fortunes, turning them into a side that won every major trophy in club football. It also raised the bar for the level of investment required to compete at the top of the Premier League.   Mr Abramovich made his money in the 1990s during Boris Yeltsin's presidency of Russia.  This week a BBC Panorama investigation said it had uncovered new evidence about the ""corrupt"" deals that made his fortune. The Chelsea owner made billions after buying an oil company from the Russian government in what BBC Panorama said was a rigged auction in 1995. Mr Abramovich paid around $250m (Â£190m) for Sibneft, before later selling it back to the Russian government for $13bn in 2005. His lawyers say there is no basis for alleging he has amassed very substantial wealth through criminality."
Oil price falls below $100 but petrol hits new high,2022-03-15T22:22:53.000Z,"Motoring groups have called for fuel prices to fall as the cost of crude oil fell to its lowest level for two weeks. The price of Brent crude - the global benchmark for prices - dropped below $100 a barrel for the first time since the start of March. The RAC has said it is ""vital"" that fuel retailers start passing on falling wholesale prices to consumers. Petrol prices hit another record high on Monday, meaning it costs more than Â£90 to fill a family car, the RAC said. The average price of a litre of petrol rose to 163.71p on Monday, and diesel also hit a fresh record of 173.68p. Oil prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine, with the price of Brent crude oil hitting a near 14-year high at one point. But in the past few days, the price of oil has dropped due to a number of factors, including hopes of progress in ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine, and also expectations that demand from China will ease as Covid cases there surge. Brent crude fell to about $98 a barrel on Tuesday before recovering some ground. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that although petrol prices were at record highs, drivers ""should be encouraged"" by the fall in oil and wholesale prices. ""It's now vital that the biggest retailers who buy fuel most often start to reflect these reductions at the pumps to give drivers a much-needed break from the pain of constantly rising prices,"" he added.  How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices?Petrol prices set to ease after hitting fresh highsFuel price jump will hit food bills, industry says The AA said that the wholesale price of petrol has plummeted by 12.8p a litre since Wednesday.  Luke Bosdet from the AA said: ""We should be seeing these record prices level off and start to fall away later this week. If not, MPs who are being deluged by complaints from angry constituents, need to be asking questions in Parliament. ""The government is under intense pressure from the cost of living crisis. They don't need the fuel trade to 'feather' a potential drop in pump prices."" Andrew Opie from the British Retail Consortium said supermarket retailers ""understand the cost pressures"" facing motorists, and will do ""everything they can to offer the best value-for-money across petrol forecourts, particularly if the price of oil falls"". The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent forecourts, said it would expect prices to fall when fresh stock is delivered.  Gordon Balmer, the PRA's Executive Director, said forecourts bought from suppliers based on a price with one or two days' lag, or in some cases a week's lag.  This means it can take a few days for wholesale prices to filter through to the pumps. Oil prices are mainly determined by the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate, as agreements are made in dollars. Russia is the third largest oil exporter and some Western countries, for example the US and Canada, decided to halt imports from the country in response to Russia's actions. It means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to increased prices. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, so is not as dependent on Russia for the commodity supply as other European countries are and has said it plans to phase it out. It is, however, affected by the global shifts in price. On Monday, some analysts told MPs on the Treasury Committee that they expected the recent fall in the oil price to be temporary. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at financial services company Investec, said further restrictions on Russian oil exports would mean consumers ""need to get ready for what could be continued increases in fuel prices.""  Dr Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects, told the committee that petrol prices could rise to around Â£2.40 a litre. And that diesel prices of ""Â£2.50 - even closer to Â£3"" were ""definitely in the realms of possibility"". Energy Minister Greg Hands has said the UK's transition to cleaner forms of energy production is now ""an issue of national security"" and not just of decarbonisation."
Ukraine UK refugee hosting scheme: Mum-of-four opens home to refugees,2022-03-15T16:46:14.000Z,"Two days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Mandi and John Arnold were curled up on the sofa of their home in Shropshire, streaming a film about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on Netflix.   It struck a nerve with the mum-of-four - she and John were both born in 1986, the same year as the disaster. So later that week when Mandi saw news of millions of Ukrainians fleeing their homes to escape Russian attacks, including in the Chernobyl area, she jumped at the chance to help. ""From the moment this all started to evolve, my heart just went straight out to them and I thought if I could help anyone I would do so without any reservations,"" she says. On Monday evening Mandi, 35, was among the almost 90,000 people to register their interest in a new visa scheme allowing people in the UK to host Ukrainian refugees in their own homes. Many of those who have signed up to help are doing so because their children have all grown up, left home and they've got some extra space. But Mandi's house is a pretty hectic place to be. She and John live with their sons, one-year-old Presley and four-year-old Phoenix, and Mandi's nine-year-old daughter, Amalia - not to mention pet cat Nala and Oakley the Labrador. Mandi's 19-year-old daughter, who's studying in Scotland, is also ""in and out"" of the house. ""It's quite a busy household anyway, it's constantly on the go,"" Mandi says. ""Adding more would just be more love, more memories."" How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees in UK homesHow can Ukrainian refugees come to the UK?89,000 sign up to UK's refugee site The family will free up one of the bedrooms for refugees to live in. They'll bring in an old single bed from the garage and have space for a child as well as an adult, if needed. Mandi and John's sons aren't quite old enough to understand that they'll be sharing their home with strangers in the near future, but Mandi has explained it to her daughter, Amalia. She's excited about meeting new people and will ""welcome anyone with open arms"", Mandi says. Under the newly-launched Homes for Ukraine scheme, UK households can offer a space for a refugee to live for at least six months. Each host household will be offered Â£350 a month, tax-free, as a ""thank you"" payment. They won't be expected to provide food and living expenses, but can choose to offer this.  Mandi fled an abusive relationship when she was younger, leaving her network of friends and family behind to start a new life. To begin with she had nowhere to call home, so lived in hotels for months. She and John scraped the money together from what he'd saved up from his business selling private number plates. Mandi says she knows fleeing a warzone is ""completely different"" to what she went through, but she can relate to the feeling of disconnect many Ukrainian refugees might have as they step foot on UK soil for the first time. ""I know the feeling of removing yourself from somewhere that you once called home, or once felt secure and safe,"" she says. ""I've been in times of struggle, I've been in situations where I really needed someone to help. To know that I've overcome that and got to where I am now, I know it's something that can be achieved and all it takes is time and love. And these people deserve that."" Mandi says she thinks the whole family will benefit from taking in Ukrainian refugees. ""My kids, they've got all the love to give and we don't have much family. I'm not saying I'm going to grab [the refugees] and say 'you're my family now,' but they will be welcomed as a family member,"" she says. ""I've got a lot of love to give and it's the perfect opportunity to give it to someone who's in need."" ...from people across the UK who have hosted refugees or asylum seekers in their own homes in the past:  1. Be prepared for the mental impact. Lucy Stevens, near Colchester: It is likely people will be very traumatised. Our foster son was highly traumatised and required a lot of input with regards to mental health [which] also has an impact on your own family. 2. Find people who match your stage of life. Ruth Elphinston, Birmingham: If you've got young kids, bring in families with young kids. Or if your kids have left home, think about hosting a young adult. It makes things easier as they'll fit in with the way you're living your life already. 3. Lean on your community. Ruth: Ask neighbours and friends to help you out. They could maybe show your refugees around the area, offer them work, or have you all over for a meal. 4. Think about ground rules. Alison Baxter, Oxford. Sharing the sitting room, smoking and if you will cook for them are all points to consider. It's better to set down clear guidance because your guest is going to be anxious if you just say ""make yourself at home"". 5. Give them space. Robert and Margaret Spooner, Sheffield: Don't force your guests to speak about their experiences. Instead focus on finding common bonds, as well as giving them the chance to do small jobs or make food to take their mind off things. 6. Get the GP sorted early. Karina Litvack, London: I've never found access to the NHS to be a problem for the refugees I've helped, but you sometimes have to book an interpreter which takes longer.  7. Don't feel bad about saying no. Justyna Bell, Belfast: Have a conversation with your entire household before you decide for sure about taking someone in. Really open up and don't think it's not very humanitarian if you have some objections."

John Cole, 40, Angharad Williamson, 30, and a 14 year old who cannot be named, deny murdering Logan Mwangi. A friend of Mr Cole, Callum Williams, told Cardiff Crown Court he had seen Logan being disciplined in the house in Sarn, Bridgend.   This included standing on the step for 30 minutes each time.  He was also denied Chinese takeaway and fed cereal for dinner instead for misbehaving, the court heard.  Murder trial told accused, 14, was 'a monster'Boy, 5, found in river had 'significant injuries' Mr Williams said he had seen Logan on a video call on 27 July, just days before his body was found in the River Ogmore in Sarn, Bridgend.  He said the boy was ""very happy and joyful"" and had been colouring in a picture of a field and some flowers.  The court was also told Logan had previously been taken to A&E after an injury to his arm or shoulder following a fall down the stairs.  Jurors were told hospital staff had referred the matter to social services because of concerns over a delay in reporting the injury, and Ms Williamson had ""tried to put the injury back in place"". The court also heard from nursery teacher Catherine Richards who said Logan ""would light up the classroom with his smile"" and ""was a very bright little boy"" who had never been any trouble. She said there was an occasion when she saw Logan with a bruise on his face, which said he had ""poked himself"" in school, but Ms Williamson said had been the result of him being hit with by a Nerf gun while playing with Mr Cole.  The court heard there was another incident when Logan had soiled himself in school, Ms Richards said Logan ""was very distressed about it and didn't want mum to know"". He asked for the clothes to be thrown out.  Logan's mother, Angharad Williamson, 30, step-father, John Cole, 40, both of Sarn, and a 14-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, all deny murder. All three are also accused of perverting the course of justice, including moving Logan's body to the river near Pandy Park, removing his clothing, washing bloodstained bed linen, and making a false missing person report to police. Ms Williamson and the youth pleaded not guilty to both offences, while Mr Cole admitted perverting the course of justice. The two adults were also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they both deny. Last July, Logan was found with 56 ""catastrophic"" injuries, which were consistent with a fall from a great height or a car crash, the court previously heard. The trial continues."
Ukraine war: Protester exposes cracks in Kremlin's war message,2022-03-15T17:44:33.000Z,"Russian state TV's Channel One plays a crucial part in the Kremlin's media messaging. It is Russia's second most popular channel, and its flagship news programme Vremya (Time) is watched by millions. Normally, there is no room for deviation from the party line. So when Marina Ovsyannikova ran on to the set behind the news anchor in prime time, brandishing a poster saying ""Stop the War!"", it was an unprecedented moment of dissent against the Kremlin which reached into living rooms across the country. Ms Ovsyannikova, who has a Ukrainian father and Russian mother, has been fined 30,000 roubles (Â£214, $280) for an anti-war video she had also released. Her protest is extraordinary in more ways than one.  To start with, Channel One viewers are not even used to hearing the word ""war"" used to describe Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The government has ordered the media to call it a ""special military operation"" launched to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine. Ms Ovsyannikova's protest also targeted the core President Putin supporters: most Russians still use state TV as their main source of news, rather than from reports in the diminishing number of independent websites or from social media.  Staging a protest like this takes extraordinary courage. Ten days earlier, Russia approved a law under which anyone challenging the Kremlin's version of events in Ukraine can face up to 15 years in jail.  Almost 15,000 anti-war protesters have been detained since the invasion began, according to the Ovd-info website. None of them have reached into as many Russia homes as Ms Ovsyannikova did. Beyond a few seconds of exposure on Channel One, state media have ignored the protest. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has dismissed her action as hooliganism. For fear of being targeted, independent Russian websites have blurred out or pixelated Ms Ovsyannikova's poster.  Novaya Gazeta, for example, left only one line from her poster still legible: ""Don't believe propaganda."" It is a different story on social media, where this anti-Putin moment has been seen as a glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak Russian media landscape.  ""Marina Ovsyannikova is a hero of Russia!"" opposition politician Ilya Yashin said on Twitter. ""Five seconds of truth can wash away the dirt of weeks of propaganda,"" said another opposition politician, Lev Shlosberg. Her protest is not the only crack to appear in the Kremlin media machine's campaign to convince Russians that the operation in Ukraine is neither a war nor an invasion. News broke hours afterwards that a veteran presenter from another top television channel, NTV, had left the country. ""First, I left [Russia] because I was afraid they would not let me go just like that, then I submitted my resignation,"" Lilia Gildeyeva told a prominent blogger.

Ukraine war: European leaders risk train ride to meet Zelensky,2022-03-16T10:20:02.000Z,"Ukraine has praised the courage of three European leaders who made a long, hazardous journey by rail from Poland to Kyiv in a show of support as the city came under further Russian attack. The prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday evening as a curfew began in Kyiv. Afterwards, the Czech leader told Ukrainians that they were ""not alone"". They are the first Western leaders to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded. ""We admire your brave fight,"" Petr Fiala wrote in a tweet. ""We know that you're also fighting for our lives. You're not alone, our countries stand by your side."" ""Your visit is a powerful expression of support for Ukraine,"" Mr Zelensky is quoted as telling the group. On Wednesday, Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki tweeted that Ukraine was reminding Europe what courage was. It was time for ""sluggish and decayed"" Europe to reawaken and ""break through her wall of indifference and give Ukraine hope"", he said. The leaders had arrived back in Poland on Wednesday morning, a Polish government spokesperson said. Also on the trip was Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland's ruling party, and he called for the creation of a Nato or international peacekeeping mission that ""will also be able to defend itself and operate in Ukraine"". However, one of his advisers later clarified that Mr Kaczynski had not been calling for Nato to get involved militarily. ""Here the position is unchanged. Neither Poland nor Nato are taking, or will take part, in the war,"" Michal Dworczyk told Polish Radio. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on Twitter that ""devastating"" sanctions against Russia had been discussed during the meeting in Kyiv, including the ""recognition of Russia as a sponsor of terrorism"". As the talks took place on Tuesday evening, loud explosions could be heard from fighting on the western edge of the capital city.  The European Union said the politicians were not carrying any particular mandate, but that leaders in Brussels were aware of the trip, as it was mentioned during an informal EU summit in Versailles, France, last week.  Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz admitted the trip was risky, but said it was ""worth taking for the sake of values"". He said they had told the Russians the visit was taking place.  All three leaders on the trip to Kyiv have been vocal supporters of Ukraine in recent weeks. Slovenia's prime minister said last week that the EU should send a strong message that Ukraine will eventually be granted membership. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said the visit was a strong and important gesture to show solidarity with Ukraine.  ""Ukraine's security is European security; therefore we need to do everything possible to help them survive this sickening barbaric Russian attack,"" he told the BBC. The leaders decided to travel by train because flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reports.  Ukraine's president has repeatedly called on Nato to impose a no-fly zone over his country's airspace, but Nato has refused. Mr Zelensky said Ukrainians now understood they could not join Nato: ""We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognised. I am glad that our people are beginning to understand this and rely on themselves and our partners who help us.""

Fox News' Pierre Zakrzewski and Oleksandra Kuvshinova killed in Kyiv,2022-03-15T22:30:08.000Z,"Two journalists working for Fox News have been killed in Ukraine, staff at the US network say. Cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and Oleksandra Kuvshinova, 24, were killed when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire in Horenka, on the outskirts of Kyiv. Their colleague, Benjamin Hall, 39, was wounded and remains in hospital. Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott said it was a ""heartbreaking day"" for the organisation. Ms Scott said Zakrzewski's ""passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched"". ""Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for Fox News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us,"" she said. National security correspondent for Fox News, Jennifer Griffin, said Zakrzewski was ""wildly popular"" and ""profoundly committed to telling the story"".  ""His talents were vast and there wasn't a role that he didn't jump in to help with in the field - from photographer to engineer to editor to producer, and he did it all under immense pressure with tremendous skill,"" she tweeted.  Ms Griffin described Kuvshinova as a ""bright light and talented journalist"". ""The loss we feel cannot be put into words,"" she said.  Senior field producer for Fox Yonat Friling said Kuvshinova had been working with the team for the past month and ""did a brilliant job"". ""We have lost a beautiful brave woman"" Ms Friling said. ""She loved music and she was funny and kind."" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the killing of Kuvshinova and Zakrzewski, who was an Irish citizen. ""My thoughts are with their families, friends and fellow journalists,"" the taoiseach tweeted. News that Mr Hall was injured emerged on Monday but Ms Scott gave no further detail.  On Monday Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, posted on Telegram that Mr Hall was in a serious condition. Mr Hall, dual US-UK citizen, joined Fox News in 2015 and has been heavily involved in the network's foreign affairs coverage. The attack which killed Zakrzewski and Kuvshinova follows the death on Sunday of 50-year-old US journalist Brent Renaud, who was shot and killed in the town of Irpin.  According to Lyudmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament's human rights chief, at least two other Ukrainian journalists have also been killed in the conflict."

Met Police apologises for strip-search of Hackney schoolgirl,2022-03-15T20:20:06.000Z,"A black schoolgirl was strip-searched by police after being wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis. The ""traumatic"" search by Metropolitan Police officers took place without another adult present at the girl's secondary school in Hackney in 2020. A safeguarding report on the incident concluded it was unjustified and racism was ""likely"" to have been a factor. Scotland Yard said the officers' actions were ""regrettable"" and it ""should never have happened"". According to the report, the impact on the pupil - referred to as Child Q - was ""profound"" and the repercussions ""obvious and ongoing"". Family members described her as changing from a ""happy-go-lucky girl to a timid recluse that hardly speaks"", who now self-harms and needs therapy. Police were called to a school in Hackney at the end of 2020 by teachers, who told investigators they had been concerned the teenager had drugs in her possession because she smelt of cannabis. She was taken to the medical room and strip-searched by two female officers, while teachers remained outside. During the ordeal her intimate body parts were exposed and she was made to take off her sanitary towel, according to the review. No drugs were found.  Her family strongly believe the strip search was a racist incident, and the review found her experiences are ""unlikely to have been the same"" had she not been black. The Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review, published in March, was conducted by City & Hackney Safeguarding Children Partnership (CHSCP) . It said it was highly likely that ""adultification bias"" was a factor - where adults perceive black children as being older than they are because they see them as more ""streetwise"". In a written statement to the review, the girl said she wanted everyone who allowed the strip search to happen to ""be held responsible"". She said: ""I need to know that the people who have done this to me can't do it to anyone else ever again, in fact so no-one else can do this to any other child in their care."" Investigators found that school staff deferred to the police's authority and ""should have been more challenging"". This has been accepted by the school, with one staff member saying: ""I have never known, nor would I condone, a strip-search of a young person on a school site."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) was now investigating, the Met confirmed. Det Supt Dan Rutland, of the Met's Central East Command, said: ""We recognise that the findings of the safeguarding review reflect this incident should never have happened. ""It is truly regrettable and on behalf of the Met Police I would like to apologise to the child concerned, her family and the wider community."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said this was a ""deeply disturbing case"" that no child should face and he would be ""closely following"" the IOPC review. Hackney Council's mayor and deputy mayor have condemned the ""humiliating, traumatising and utterly shocking treatment"" by police officers. They have asked for a report in six to nine months on progress made regarding the review's eight findings and 14 recommendations. Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Covid in Scotland: Mask rules will stay in force until April,2022-03-15T19:59:34.000Z,"Scotland's rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport will remain in place until April due to a rise in cases of Covid-19. All other restrictions on businesses and services are to move from legal requirement to guidance from 21 March. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would be ""prudent"" to keep mask rules in place due to a spike in cases. These will be reviewed again in two weeks, and are likely to be converted to guidance by 4 April. Ms Sturgeon said a sharp rise in infections was putting ""significant pressure on hospital capacity"", but that vaccines were still giving people good protection. She also told MSPs that mass testing will be wound down in April, with routine testing and contact tracing to end by May. Omicron sub-variant driving Covid rise in ScotlandWhat are the UK's Living with Covid plans? When will free Covid tests end? The average number of new cases reported each day in Scotland is more than 12,000, up from an average of 6,900 per day three weeks ago. There has also been a rise in the number of people in hospital with Covid-19, from 1,060 three weeks ago to 1,996 today. Ms Sturgeon said the BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus in Scotland, accounting for more than 80% of cases - adding that while it spreads much more quickly, there is no evidence it causes more severe illness than previous variants. Under the government's strategic framework for managing the virus, remaining legal restrictions - including mask-wearing and the need for businesses to record customer contact details and follow other guidance - were to be lifted on 21 March. The rules for businesses will be dropped as planned, but Ms Sturgeon said she needed to ""ask everyone to be patient for a little while longer on face coverings"". She said: ""I know this will be disappointing for businesses and service providers such as day care services.  ""However, ensuring continued widespread use of face coverings will provide some additional protection - particularly for the most vulnerable - at a time when the risk of infection is very high, and it may help us get over this spike more quickly."" The first minister stressed that the lifting of other measures marked ""steady progress back to normal life and a more sustainable way of managing this virus"". Testing in England is being wound down by the end of March, but Ms Sturgeon said there would be no change in Scotland until Easter. Asymptomatic people will still be advised to test regularly until 18 April - with tests free of charge - and people with symptoms should continue to get a PCR test until the end of that month. However, the population-wide testing and contact tracing system will come close at the end of April, with people with symptoms advised to stay at home. From May onwards, testing will be used on a targeted basis to monitor levels of the virus in society and to look out for new variants. The Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland said changes were slower than many would like, adding that ""the impression that Scotland has a first-in, last-out approach to Covid restrictions frustrates many"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the announcement about face coverings was a ""bitter disappointment"". Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said: ""Businesses cannot continue to operate with the start-stop lever being pulled just weeks apart."" And the Scottish Licensed Trade Association said the move will confuse visitors from England, where face coverings are no longer required by law. It has become almost second nature - grab your mask alongside your keys as you dash out the front door. And in Scotland, unlike any other part of the UK, you will be doing it for a while longer. Many in public health think this is not a big ask, a sensible move at a time when community transmission is so high. It is a very visible reminder that Covid has not gone away, and they point to a growing body of research that suggests community mask wearing can offer some protection against infection spread. However, others argue the evidence is not compelling and the reality is people don't wear masks in the places where they would make the most difference, at home with family and friends.  After all, Scotland is experiencing a surge in cases despite such measures being in place.  The Scottish Conservatives said the retention of the mask rules was ""a blow for households and businesses"". Leader Douglas Ross urged Ms Sturgeon to trust people to manage their own risks, adding: ""We can't get complacent with Covid, but we need to move forward - we can't stay stuck with Covid rules forever."" Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said hospitals were ""overwhelmed"" with staff absences rising, and called for more information about testing for health workers. Ms Sturgeon said health and care staff would continue to test twice weekly after the wider programme ends, and that the system would focus on high-risk settings like hospitals and care homes. Meanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said it was disheartening that ""despite the extra sacrifices that have been made in Scotland, our infection rates are still so stubbornly high"". Health Secretary Humza Yousaf later told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime he expects Covid hospital occupancy levels to reach record levels in the next few days. He also defended the extension of the face covering rules and described the evidence for their effectiveness as ""indisputable"". Asked if he was concerned about another wave of infections given the current case numbers, Mr Yousaf said he has been reassured by the success of the vaccination programme. He told the programme: ""If you have not had your first, second or indeed your booster dose then please get it because that is clearly and significantly been the difference in terms of severity of illness. ""If we had these case numbers that we are seeing today, and we have seen over the last number of weeks, without a vaccine we would be frankly in lockdown. ""Vaccines are the game changer.""

Russians to give American astronaut ride to Earth in spite of tensions,2022-03-15T16:40:58.000Z,"A US astronaut will now be returning to Earth, after fears his Russian lift home might not materialise. It was originally thought Mark Vande Hei - who has been in space for 355 days - might be left behind on the ISS due to heightened tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  But it has been confirmed he will travel aboard a Russian capsule to Kazakhstan. The American and two Russian cosmonauts will be brought back to Earth. ""I can tell you for sure Mark is coming home... We are in communication with our Russian colleagues. There's no fuzz on that,"" Joel Montalbano, Nasa's International Space Station (ISS) programme manager said. He admitted the astronauts were ""aware of what's going on"" in the world, but they still work as a team. Under international space law, astronauts from all nations must ""provide all possible help"" to other astronauts when needed, ""including emergency landing in a foreign country or at sea"".  Dmitry Rogozin, chief of the Russian Space Agency Roscosmos, had previously warned about sanctions causing technical issues to the ISS but Mr Montalbano said it had continued to run smoothly.  ""All these activities have continued for 20 years and nothing has changed in the last three weeks. Our control centres operate successfully, flawlessly, seamlessly,"" he said. The US controls power and life support aboard the ISS and Russia controls things such as its propulsion. Earlier this month on Russian state TV, Mr Rogozin announced Roscosmos would halt rocket sales to the US in response to sanctions against Russia. Mr Vande Hei, 55, has now made a new US record for the most time spent in space."
"Russia sanctions Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and others",2022-03-15T17:51:39.000Z,"Russia's foreign ministry says it has imposed sanctions on US President Joe Biden and 12 other US officials. The list includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, press secretary Jen Psaki and other members of the administration. But it also includes two surprises: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden's son Hunter. The measures block their entry into Russia and freeze any assets held in the country. However, the ministry has said the sanctions will not impede necessary high-level contacts for the affected individuals. Other names on the list are: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark MilleyNational Security Adviser Jake SullivanDeputy National Security Adviser Daleep SinghUS Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha PowerDeputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally AdeyemoPresident of the Export-Import Bank of the US Reta Jo Lewis The ministry has said it is applying sanctions ""on the basis of reciprocity"". Russia is now the most sanctioned country in the world. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?Russia's ex-president targeted in new UK sanctionsHow sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia Western countries have already sanctioned top Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov. On Tuesday, the US announced sanctions on 11 Russian defence leaders and signalled that it could levy sanctions against Alexander Lukashenko, the President of Moscow-allied Belarus. Earlier, the UK slapped sanctions on another 370 Russian individuals, including former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev. President Biden is due to travel to Europe next week to attend an emergency Nato summit in Brussels where he will assert Washington's ""iron-clad"" backing to its allies, the White House said on Tuesday.  Hillary Clinton can abandon dreams she may have had of buying a vacation dacha in Sochi. Any Joe Biden post-presidency plans for starting a business in Moscow will have to be shelved. Jokes aside, the Russian ""stop"" order placed on the US President, senior White House staff and - interestingly - a former secretary of state who has not held public office in nine years is a symbolic but not particularly consequential reprisal for the staggering sanctions the US and allies have imposed on Russia. It's not like any of the listed Americans had significant financial interests in Russia. The move is a reflection, however, of the growing chasm between the US and Russia in the wake of the latter's invasion of Ukraine. Prohibiting the top American diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, from even setting foot on Russian soil suggests relations between the two nations are at a post-Cold War nadir. That has very real consequences outside of the Ukrainian conflict, as the US and Russia had hoped to co-operate on Iranian nuclear negotiations, counterterrorism, global warming and other pressing international issues. Chances of that happening now are increasingly dim."
UK gets first new-style pylons in a century,2022-03-15T15:24:07.000Z,"The first 36 of a new T-shaped design of electricity pylon have been wired up, National Grid has announced. The pylons, the first major UK redesign since 1927, will be rolled out where possible across England and Wales. Instead of an Eiffel-Tower-style lattice A-frame with a series of arms holding the electricity cables, they are strung below a cross-arm atop a single pole. The aim is to reduce the visual impact on the environment.  The new design, submitted by Danish company Bystrup, was selected from more than 250 entries in a 2011 competition run by the Royal Institute of British Architects and the government. At 35m (115ft), they are about a third shorter than traditional high-voltage pylons, with a smaller ground footprint. The first ones form part of a 57km (35-mile) route that will carry low-carbon electricity between Bridgwater and Portbury, in Somerset.  They will connect the Hinkley Point C Nuclear power station to six million homes and businesses, National Grid says. Hinkley nuclear power station on track for 2026 opening Hinkley pylon scheme in Somerset given the green light The electricity supply will be turned on in October. As part of the project, 249 old-style pylons will be removed. Their design, submitted by US engineering company Miliken Brothers, was chosen by leading British architect Sir Reginald Blomfield, the designer of London's Lambeth Bridge, in a 1927 competition. Formally known as ""transmission towers"", they became known as ""pylons"" from the Greek word ""pyle"" meaning ""gateway"". Egyptology was all the rage after the 1922 discovery of boy king Tutankhamun's tomb and mummy. And the public thought the new steel towers resembled the impressive obelisks on either side of the doors of ancient Egyptian temples. There are about 22,000 pylons in England and Wales, covering more than 4,300 miles.   They need to be high to straddle obstacles such as roads, rivers and railway lines and ensure nothing comes too close to them.   The electricity cables on pylons are uninsulated, so there is a very high risk of electric shocks. But birds are not electrocuted, because they are not touching the ground, so the electricity stays in the power line."
Queen holds afternoon tea for Canada's governor general after missing service,2022-03-15T19:11:49.000Z,"The Queen has hosted an afternoon tea for Canada's governor general, the day after missing the Commonwealth Service. Mary Simon was welcomed to Windsor Castle by the Queen, 95, on Tuesday. The monarch's absence from the annual Westminster Abbey service is understood to have been due to concerns about her ability to travel and her mobility. She was represented by the Prince of Wales at the event. In a message, she praised the Commonwealth as a force for good ""in these testing times"".  Her Commonwealth Day message also repeated the lifelong commitment she made when she was 21, that she would devote her life in service.  The ceremony in Westminster, attended by royals including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, celebrated the work of the Commonwealth and also focused on the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.  The Queen has recently recovered from Covid and returned to holding diplomatic audiences and meetings in person. She has also been carrying out some virtual engagements. Ms Simon and her husband Whit Fraser were greeted by the Queen in the castle's Oak Room.  The Queen, who is also monarch of Canada, was pictured standing without the walking stick she has been seen using recently as she shook hands with Ms Simon.  Ms Simon is Canada's first indigenous governor general and took up her post last July.  Earlier on Tuesday, the Queen held two virtual audiences at her Berkshire residence, receiving the ambassadors of Mongolia and Tajikistan via video link.  She is due to be represented by Prince Charles again at the next Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, due to take place in Rwanda in June.  "
Ukraine's wartime rail chief has to be faster than the Russians tracking him,2022-03-15T16:51:50.000Z,"There is a last-minute change of plan. He won't be leaving from the main station after all. The bodyguards move fast and we follow, racing along the quiet streets behind the convoy, and into the suburbs.  The Russians would like to kill him.  Oleksandr Kamyshin is sure of this. So the 37-year-old chairman of Ukraine's railway network constantly changes his travel plans. Never stay in one place too long. Never have a routine that the Russians can discover. ""We have to be faster than those people who try to track us,"" he tells me.  The railway is the country's biggest employer with 231,000 staff across 233,000 square miles (603,470 sq km) of territory - Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe. So far Mr Kamyshin estimates his staff have helped to move 2.5 million people to safety. But the vast operation has come at a cost. Schedules have to be constantly updated because of Russian attacks. Since Vladimir Putin's invasion began, 33 railway staff have been killed. ""They hit our track daily. They hit the stations. Our people risk their lives. They go under shelling. They keep saving people,"" says Mr Kamyshin.  When we first meet, he is sitting at a long table with his close advisors, studying a map of the national rail network. Police guard the entrance to the room. There are constant phone calls. ""Thank you for your support. But I also have a request,"" he says to one caller. ""Please help us build trade between Ukraine and Poland."" He hangs up and smiles. ""That was the Polish minister for infrastructure,"" he says.  Mr Kamyshin wants to set up a joint venture with Poland to send Ukrainian exports west.  Before joining the railways Mr Kamyshin was a financier but he is now one of the most important men in the country. In a few weeks he has gone from reforming the rail sector to a wartime director of operations.  ""All people in Ukraine were businesspeople, farmers and all other professions before the war started. Now all people in Ukraine are at war. All of us have started doing war,"" he says. His own life is a blur of rail journeys, stopping at one place to talk to local staff, at another to meet government officials, and constantly in contact with the senior leadership in Kyiv.  He hasn't seen his wife and two young sons since the war started nearly three weeks ago. Not only do the railways keep refugees moving, they also deliver tonnes of aid to the embattled areas of the country, transport troops to frontline cities, and continue to export whatever Ukraine can produce in these wartime conditions. A Russian blockade has closed the key ports in the south. Mr Kamyshin comes across as a man who is planning for a long campaign. ""Instead of seaports we go west,"" he explains. ""We have launched a programme to relocate production from east to west. So we can move people, ideas, plans, maybe machinery to launch new production in the west."" It is an ambitious project and could be essential to the country's economic survival. However, Mr Kamyshin believes the West needs to do more than supply weapons and humanitarian aid. He wants the Nato military alliance to enforce a no-fly zone. It is a mantra repeated by government officials at nearly every opportunity - however unlikely the prospect of it happening.  ""This war will be won by Ukraine anyway. Now the only thing that needs to happen is the closing of the sky by the West."" My last sight of Mr Kamyshin is close to midnight at a suburban rail depot. He is walking along the side of the tracks in darkness until the spotlight of the approaching train briefly illuminates his small group.  The train pulls alongside and a stewardess welcomes him on board. I cannot say where his train is heading, but the night ahead will be filled with calls and discussions. There will be a few hours of sleep, perhaps, and constant checking of where the Russians have recently attacked. ""We will keep repairing the tracks once the firing stops,"" he says before leaving.

Hertfordshire gardener smashes own tomato growing record,2022-03-15T19:24:50.000Z,"A man has broken his own world record for growing the most tomatoes from a single stem. Douglas Smith from Stanstead Abbotts, Hertfordshire, grew 1,269 tomatoes on a single truss last September, a feat which has just been verified by Guinness World Records.  It beat his previous record of 839 which came from a plant that bore fruit just before the new record-breaker. The title-holder prior to that was 488 which was set in 2010. Mr Smith said: ""The record attempts were only a few weeks apart but it took a little bit of time for the second record to go through the system.  ""We counted up the first plant and there lurking in the background was the second one."" With so many tomatoes he said he had been able to keep friends and family stocked up with punnets of fresh produce.  Mr Smith said he researched different aspects to help him make the right choices for his record attempts, including taking soil samples to be tested at a laboratory to allow him to make any necessary adjustments.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter In the past, Mr Smith has also grown a giant sunflower measuring 20ft (6m), a giant pumpkin and giant tomatoes.  ""With all these things you want to have a bit of a run-up. Every year I'll split it up into two main camps,"" he said. ""I want to have stuff that I'm focusing on - this year it's on the most tomatoes, but then I'll run little experiments with other giant veg and giant crops. ""They won't be the focus of the year but you want to trial and experiment so when you do have a go you're going to be a little more up to speed."" This year's experiments are due to include peas, aubergines and potatoes.  Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Gucci bag murder: 'Why are shops selling 15-inch machetes?',2022-03-15T22:06:39.000Z,"As Ryan O'Connor walked home with his new Gucci bag he had no idea he had just minutes left to live.  He was walking across the Aberthaw Road roundabout in Alway, Newport, when two men brandishing hunting knives stabbed him through the heart and lungs. The 26-year-old fractured his hand during the attack, in which witnesses saw his assailants kicking him before they fled back to their car. He did not know his killers but was a random victim of a savage attack involving a group of men, all known to police. Now there have been calls for those responsible for illegal knife sales to be held accountable.  Nick Corrigan, director of Media Academy Cymru which runs weapons prevention programme Braver Choices, said: ""Children are not allowed by law to buy knives but it is clear that enterprising young people are using other people's identification documents to get knives. ""What we need to be asking retailers is, 'why are they selling 15-inch machetes?'.  ""What is that going to do for anyone whether that is legal or not legal?"" Just 1% of children carry knives in the mistaken belief it makes them safer, he said, but those who did were 63% more likely to be stabbed. ""What we need to do as a legislation, as a country, in Wales particularly, is look at those establishments selling those knives and who they are selling them to and make sure they are accountable for sales,"" Mr Corrigan said. ""Just showing some ID that might not be theirs is not good enough.""  Ryan O'Connor murder accused filmed with knivesGucci bag murder: two accused decline to give evidenceGucci bag murder: Accused was 'bubbly' after attack Two men were found guilty of murdering Mr O'Connor after a trial at Newport Crown Court.  Known to many as Apple, he was stabbed five times and bled to death on the pavement in June last year. Joseph Jeremy, 18, of no fixed abode and Lewis Aquilina, 20, of Riverside, Cardiff, were found guilty of the murder and robbery of Mr O'Connor.  Kyle Raisis, 18, of Canton, Cardiff, was convicted of manslaughter and robbery, while Ethan Strickland, 19, of Caerau, Cardiff, was found guilty of robbery.  Elliot Fiteni, 20, of no fixed abode, was cleared of murder, manslaughter and robbery. At the time of the attack Jeremy was on the run from secure accommodation where he was being held after stabbing a 17-year-old. He had continued to buy knives in that accommodation using his father's driving licence.  Ethan Strickland's relative Lee was one of three convicted for the homophobic murder of Cardiff doctor Gary Jenkins in the city's Bute Park. The much-loved and respected psychiatrist was kicked repeatedly and suffered catastrophic brain injuries. The knives used in the assault came from a Cornwall shop for so-called ""preppers"". These are survivalists readying themselves for the end of civilisation. The shop said it no longer sells knives of the type used in Mr O'Connor's killing. The BBC interviewed owner Lincoln Miles in 2015, asking him whether he was concerned knives on sale could be used for crime.  ""I would have thought if someone was [going to do that] they are going to buy a Â£2.99 kitchen knife or grab something from their kitchen,"" he said. Newport Crown Court was told Mr O'Connor's killers travelled from Cardiff to Newport in a stolen Ford Fiesta ST on the evening of 10 June last year with hunting knives, gloves and balaclavas, looking for someone to rob. Although witnesses saw only two men attack Mr O'Connor, the prosecution said all five were equally responsible because they knew the intention of the trip was to rob someone and cause serious harm. Mr O'Connor was walking home after visiting his brother Daniel and his girlfriend when he was killed. Daniel said his brother wanted to show them the Gucci bag he had bought that day. As he crossed the roundabout witnesses saw two men get out of their car.  The court heard one shouted at him to ""come here"". Clad in dark clothing and gloves they ran toward Mr O'Connor with their knives, and their victim stumbled and fell as he tried to get away.  He was stabbed through the heart and lungs and fractured his hand as he tried to fend off his attackers. Witnesses said he was kicked before the men ran back to the car, taking the bag with them. The attack lasted 30 seconds. Joanna Verallo, whose home overlooks the roundabout, told police the five drove slowly past Mr O'Connor, laughing as he lay dying, and she shouted at them and called them ""disgusting"". Joseph Jeremy, 17 at the time, was the youngest of the group and his fellow defendants said he was ""bubbling with excitement"" after the stabbing, saying: ""I yinged him."" He already had convictions for serious violence before Ryan O'Connor was killed and had admitted firing a replica gun in a racially aggravated assault in Penarth in August 2020, when he was given a supervision order. In November the same year he stabbed a 17-year-old Cardiff boy in the shoulder and stomach with what was described as a ""ferocious looking knife."" He later posed with the blade on Snapchat. The court heard Jeremy bought knives using his father's driving licence as ID - he was too young to buy them himself. He was staying at the home of fellow defendant and car thief Strickland. The pair spent hours making videos with their knives, even showing off a 15in (38cm) hunting knife in a Cardiff park. On making their getaway after the attack on Mr O'Connor, the group returned to Cardiff and a fuel station CCTV camera captured Jeremy putting Â£10 of petrol into the car. Witnesses gave police a description of the car and officers spotted it driving at speed on the city's Western Avenue.  There was then a high-speed chase on a busy A48 and through the streets of Pentwyn before police burst the tyres with a stinger. The car then careered into a barrier, boxed in by two police vehicles and the five ran from the car, leaving the knives behind. Jeremy live streamed his arrest on social media. During a recorded prison phone call while Jeremy was on remand, his father asked him to think about what Mr O'Connor's family were feeling.  He replied: ""I don't give a toss. This is why I need my head checked ASAP."" Traces of Mr O'Connor's blood was found on Aquilina's trainer and trousers. He claimed he was trying to kick the blade out of Jeremy's hand, describing Mr O'Connor in court as ""that poor boy"".  He drove the car to Newport after stealing it from a house in Usk in the early hours of the morning with fellow defendant Elliot Fiteni, who was cleared of murder, manslaughter and robbery. Aquilina told the court he was ""a car thief but not a murderer"". The 20 year old tried to strangle the police officer who arrested him. In a statement, PC Ben Thomas said Aquilina had his neck in a ""vice like grip"" leaving him struggling to breathe. Finally restrained and arrested on suspicion of murder he sobbed, telling police: ""It wasn't me,"" but a witness said they saw Mr O'Connor being kicked as he fought for his life. With his balaclava still on his head Strickland, 19, sobbed as armed police arrested him and claimed he didn't know anything about the murder. ""I literally got picked up 10 minutes ago,"" he told them.  In fact he was behind the wheel of the stolen Fiesta ST when traffic police spotted it racing through Cardiff. Strickland grew up around crime. His older brother Lee, a serial burglar and car thief, was one of three found guilty for the murder of Dr Gary Jenkins in Bute Park in July 2021.  Raisis, 18, sat in the back seat of the car as it left the scene of Mr O'Connor's murder. The court heard he rummaged through the bag where he found less than Â£40. Raisis was first to be arrested and police cameras showed him stumbling and falling as he tried to outrun officers. Also obsessed with knives he, along with Strickland, chose not to give evidence in court. His barrister told the jury Raisis, dressed in a light-coloured top and shorts, ""was not dressed for mayhem"". At the time of his death, Mr O'Connor's family said: ""He has left us far too soon, and he will be greatly missed by all of us. ""He was loved by his family and the local community.""  Mr O'Connor's brother Johnny dubbed his sibling ""an Alway lad through and through"". He said: ""I'm still in shock, this doesn't seem real. None of this. ""My brother, was chopsy, but had a heart of gold."" His killers will be sentenced in the coming weeks."
Fears Russia will not be able to pay its debts remain,2022-03-17T16:44:12.000Z,"Russia has claimed it has made a key interest payment to international investors and avoided a debt default. Western sanctions were imposed on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, freezing its access to its foreign currency reserves. Russia says it has made $117m payments on two dollar-denominated bonds, but investors have not yet reportedly been paid. If the payments are not made by 30 April, then Russia would be in default. In announcing that Russia had made the debt payment, Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov said he was not sure if money would go through because of sanctions.  ""We have the money, we have made the payment, now the ball is in the court, primarily, of the American authorities.""  The US Treasury Department has said that current sanctions would not stop Russia from paying this bill. Despite the confusion, if the debt is not ultimately paid by the end of the 30-day grace period, then Russia will have defaulted on its debts. Credit ratings agencies have warned that a Russian debt default is ""imminent"". The Russian government - and firms such as Gazprom, Lukoil and Sberbank - owe about $150bn to overseas investors. Most of this is in either dollars or euros, and interest and repayments must be made in those currencies. But sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine mean it has lost access to a large proportion of its $630bn (Â£470bn) in foreign currency reserves.  However, it still receives dollars for the oil, gas and other things it sells abroad, and that foreign currency is accessible. If Russia does default, it would be its first debt default since 1998.  It would also be its first default on a foreign-currency debt since the 1917 revolution when the new Bolshevik government refused to recognize the debts of the last tsar. Russia could try to pay in roubles. Its foreign ministry has said it would pay international investors in roubles if it were stopped from paying them in dollars or euros.  Most of Russia's debts need to be paid in dollars or euros, but debt agreements do allow for different currencies to be used - in which case paying in roubles could be acceptable. This would depend on whether the rouble payment was judged to be the same value as the original dollar or euro amount investors were expecting. Investors in Russia have seen the value of their investments slump in recent days. The problem for many will have been the swiftness of Russia's fall from financial grace, which has left them with little time to react by selling-off their holdings. Credit ratings agency Moody's says that in its 21-point ratings scale, which indicates how reliable a country is as a place to invest, Russia's rating is at its second-lowest, and could fall still further. Moody's says this rating means that it expects Russia to default, and that it is warning investors in Russia that they could lose between 35% and 65% of their money.  The last time Russia defaulted - in 1998 - it sent shocks through the financial markets. A default now would be hugely symbolic but is ""unlikely to have significant ramifications,"" says Capital Economics chief economist William Jackson. The IMF has said it will downgrade its forecast of 4.4% global economic growth in 2022 as a result of the war. However, IMF head Kristalina Georgieva has also discounted the idea of a wider shock to the global financial system from a Russian default.  But she warned that the sanctions imposed on Russia would lead to a ""deep recession"" there, and that the war would drive up global food and energy prices. The unknown factor, as yet, is what debt defaults there may be by Russian firms - and what impact these may have on overseas investors who have heavily invested in Russia. Any debt default is likely to exacerbate Russia's financial and economic problems. Before it invaded Ukraine, Russia was considered one of the most creditworthy countries in the world, with low debt levels. But things have dramatically changed. Foreign firms have left in droves, and Moscow has already imposed strict credit controls to limit the outflow of money in order to protect its economy and the rouble.  Despite this, Russia's economy is set to shrink 7% this year as a result of sanctions.  Inflation in February was already 9.15% before the invasion of Ukraine. It is now forecast to surge significantly this year - despite Russia's central bank raising interest rates from 9.5% to 20%. "

Why is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil so controversial?,2022-03-15T18:54:05.000Z,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended a trip to Saudi Arabia, saying ""the widest coalition"" is needed to end reliance on Russian oil and gas. But maintaining close ties with the Gulf kingdom is controversial among critics of its human rights record. The US, UK and EU have announced that they will buy less Russian oil and gas, because of its invasion of Ukraine. However, prices have rocketed. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec and has the spare capacity to help lower prices by increasing supplies. It means Western countries need its goodwill and to keep on friendly terms with its ruling family.   PM defends Saudi trip despite human rights record Saudi Arabia is among the countries carrying out the most executions. In March it executed 81 men in a single day - more than during the whole of last year. They were convicted of ""multiple heinous crimes"", including terrorism, kidnapping and rape, state news agency SPA said. Rights organisations say many do not receive fair trials in Saudi Arabia, an allegation the government rejects. Saudi Arabia's international standing was severely damaged by the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Saudi journalist who was a prominent critic of the government. UN-appointed human rights expert Agnes Callamard said Saudi agents had ""used state means to execute Mr Khashoggi"" at its Istanbul consulate. Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and other senior officials were incriminated. Although the crown prince denied any involvement, his reputation was badly tarnished.  After the kingdom's Public Investment Fund was allowed to buy an 80% stake in Newcastle United, Mr Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, called the takeover ""heart-breaking"". OVERVIEW: The other companies owned by Newcastle's buyers In 2018, Saudi authorities arrested 13 women's rights activists who had led a campaign to lift a ban on women driving. At least four of the women were allegedly tortured and sexually harassed by interrogators. In 2020, a terrorism tribunal found the most prominent activist, Loujain al-Hathloul, guilty of crimes against the state.  After the original sentence was upheld at an appeal, Amnesty International's Lynn Maalouf said: ""By failing to quash Loujain al-Hathloul's conviction, the Saudi Arabian authorities have clearly demonstrated that they consider peaceful activism a crime.""  Women's rights activists have not been the only people detained as part of a crackdown against critics in Saudi Arabia, where political parties, trade unions and independent human rights groups are banned.  Dozens of human rights defenders, intellectuals, academics, clerics and reformists have also been arrested since 2017, merely for exercising their right to freedom of expression, according to international human rights organisations.  Many have faced what Amnesty International has said were grossly unfair trials on vague terrorism and cybercrime charges, and received harsh sentences, including the death penalty.  Days before the Newcastle United takeover, a court upheld a 20-year prison sentence handed to Saudi-American aid worker Abdul Rahman al-Sadhan for writing satirical tweets criticising the authorities. His sister, Areej, said he was ""brutally tortured"" before his conviction. Saudi Arabia has been heavily criticised for a military campaign in neighbouring Yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe. A Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 after Yemeni rebels seized control of much of the west of the country and forced the president to flee abroad. More than 100,000 people have reportedly been killed in the fighting. Tens of thousands are also estimated to have died from indirect causes, such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure. A partial blockade by the coalition has hampered efforts to help the 20 million people in need of humanitarian aid. UN experts say both sides in the conflict may have committed war crimes, though the coalition has insisted it is abiding by the rules of war. Although Saudi Arabia has no laws regarding sexual orientation or gender identity, sexual relations outside marriage, including homosexual sex, are strictly prohibited.  Under the country's interpretation of Islamic law, the death penalty is a possible punishment for same-sex sexual conduct.  It is also illegal for men to ""behave like women"" or to wear women's clothes, and vice versa. An anti-cybercrime law criminalises online activity that goes against public order and religious morals. In July 2020, a court sentenced a Yemeni blogger to 10 months in prison and then deportation for posting a video calling for equal rights, including for gay people.

Saudi Arabia: Johnson says he raised human rights in energy talks,2022-03-16T17:48:23.000Z,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he raised human rights when meeting Gulf leaders for talks about ending reliance on Russian oil and gas after the invasion of Ukraine. He discussed energy security and other issues in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday. He said a global coalition was needed ""to deal with the new reality we face"". But critics have expressed concerns about the human rights records of the countries. Last weekend, Saudi Arabia carried out a mass execution of 81 men in one day, and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been implicated in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. On Wednesday, Saudi news agency SPA announced three further executions, in what the Reprieve group described as a ""provocative act"" designed to ""flaunt the Crown Prince's power"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy"". Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of Mr Khashoggi, told the BBC Mr Johnson should not be ""doing deals"" with Crown Prince Salman unless he insisted ""on the truth and justice for Jamal's murder"". Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner told MPs Mr Johnson was on ""a begging mission to the Saudi prince"" after failing to invest in home-grown energy. PM defends Saudi trip despite human rights recordWhy is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil so controversial? But Mr Johnson said if western countries wanted to ""avoid being blackmailed"" by Russia's President Vladimir Putin, they needed to move away from using his country's fossil fuels and explore other partnerships. In the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Mr Johnson told the BBC he raised human rights and ""what we can do to stabilise oil prices"" in his meeting with Crown Prince Salman. When asked if the recent executions were discussed, Mr Johnson said ""in spite of the news that you've referred to, things are changing in Saudi Arabia"", adding, ""that's why we see value in the partnership"". Earlier, he pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a Â£1bn investment in green aviation fuel in the UK as ""the kind of thing we want to encourage"". Mr Johnson landed at Abu Dhabi airport in the UAE, where he was met by British Ambassador to the UAE Patrick Moody. He then travelled to the Saudi capital, where he met Crown Prince Salman and Saudi ministers. Recent executions in Saudi Arabia have drawn criticism from MPs and human rights groups. Tory MP Crispin Blunt said the executions left Mr Johnson with ""exquisite difficulties"" in asking Saudi Arabia for help with oil supplies. One of the world's largest oil producers and influential on the international stage, Saudi Arabia is ruled by a monarchy which restricts political rights and civil liberties. The rise of Crown Prince Salman as de-facto ruler in 2017 has seen moves towards liberalising some laws and diversifying the economy. But the Saudi government's image has been damaged in recent years, particularly by the assassination of the prominent US-based journalist in 2018, Mr Khashoggi. Saudis execute 81 men in one dayUS softens towards Saudis after murder snub He was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia said he had been killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom. But a UN investigator concluded that Mr Khashoggi was ""the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution"" for which the Saudi state was responsible. Crown Prince Salman denied any role. Mr Khashoggi's fiancee Ms Cengiz, who accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate, said Mr Johnson's rationale for meeting Crown Prince Salman was a ""flawed argument"". He ""should not run from the arms of one unpredictable tyrant"" to another, she said. ""Johnson must demand to know the truth and to get justice for the brutal killing of Jamal and for all human rights abuses,"" Ms Cengiz said. ""He cannot act as though nothing has happened. This would be so shameful."" Opposition parties and some Conservatives too are uneasy about the government's association with Saudi Arabia - and have been for years.  That's more acute after dozens of executions there a few days ago.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is no substitute for an energy strategy.  But for the government, handling the fallout of the conflict in Ukraine means what are described as ""hard-headed"" decisions, even if it's ""distasteful"".  With huge diplomatic and economic forces at play, there are no straightforward options.   Disentangling Russia's economy from the West's may seem a diplomatic no-brainer, but the cost and complications of doing so simply can't be ignored.  Read more from Laura here.  The energy talks come during a global spike in energy prices driven by tight supplies, President Putin's invasion of Ukraine and western attempts to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec and has the spare capacity to help lower prices by increasing supplies. Mr Johnson was hoping to convince Crown Prince Salman to boost his kingdom's oil production and garner his support for action against Russia. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said while the UK did not agree with ""every single policy of Saudi Arabia or the UAE"", they ""do not pose a threat to global security in the way that Vladimir Putin does"". ""We need to bring those countries into the circle of influence of the UK and pull countries away from dependence on Russia,"" she said. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Gulf states have so far refrained from overtly condemning Russia, although they did vote in favour of a UN resolution denouncing the invasion of Ukraine. Their muted reaction has caused some consternation among western nations including the UK, Dr Tobias Borckâ, a researcher of Middle East security at the RUSI think tank says. ""In the past 10 years this idea has taken hold in the Gulf that the West doesn't stand for anything anymore, that the West is no longer willing to wield its power in the world,"" Dr Borck told the BBC. He said Mr Johnson's trip was a vital opportunity to rebuild relations with the Gulf states and convey to them why the invasion of Ukraine ""is a watershed moment for European security"". Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continued as the worst war Europe has seen in decades entered its 21st day. The attacks came as Ukraine and Russia held peace talks, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky conceded that Nato membership was not on the table, in an apparent concession to Moscow. Mr Zelensky said the talks were becoming ""more realistic"", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was ""some hope for compromise"". The Ukrainian president addressed the US Congress by video link, having made similar appearances in parliaments across Europe, including the UK's."
Ukraine war: Two women in Kyiv tower blocks record their new life under siege,2022-03-16T00:01:42.000Z,
The tragedy of Afghanistan's malnourished children,2022-03-16T00:06:50.000Z,"Every few seconds a sick child is brought in to the emergency room of the main hospital in Lashkar Gah in a race against time to save the youngest casualties of Afghanistan's hunger crisis. Amidst the heart-rending sound of dozens of hungry babies crying, and desperate pleas for help from their mothers, nurses scramble to prioritise children who need urgent care. There are many such babies.   Lashkar Gah is a city in the capital of Helmand, one of Afghanistan's most war-ravaged provinces and lies roughly 400 miles (644km) south-west of Kabul.  Jalil Ahmed is brought in hardly breathing. His hands and feet have gone cold. He's rushed through to the resuscitation room. His mother Markah says he's two and a half years old, but he looks a lot tinier. He's severely malnourished and has tuberculosis. Doctors work fast to revive him.  Markah watches in tears.  ""I'm helpless as he suffers. I've spent the whole night scared that at any minute he'll stop breathing,' she says. Space has to be made in an already full intensive care unit for little Jalil. A doctor carries him there in his arms, as a nurse follows holding up the bottles of fluid and medicines that are being injected into his body through multiple tubes.   There's no time for the staff to stop. They must quickly put another baby, five-month-old Aqalah, back on oxygen. It's her third time in hospital. Doctors say that a few hours earlier, they thought she wouldn't make it, but right now, she's just about holding on.  One in every five children admitted to critical care is dying, and the situation at the hospital has been made worse in recent weeks by the spread of the highly contagious measles disease that damages the body's immune system, a deadly blow for babies already suffering from malnutrition. The hospital, run by charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, is one of a handful of fully-functioning facilities in a province that's home to around 1.5 million people. It's completely overwhelmed. It has 300 beds, but is seeing around 800 patients a day, most of them children.  There's almost nowhere else for people to turn to. Cutting off the foreign money which ran Afghanistan has dealt a double blow. It's triggered an economic crisis that has brought an already poor population to the brink of starvation, and it's led to the near collapse of the public healthcare system that it almost entirely funded before the Taliban takeover.  Child malnutrition has long been a problem in Afghanistan, but data collected by Unicef (United Nations Children's Fund) shows a massive surge in the number of children with severe acute malnutrition admitted to hospitals, from 2,407 in August 2021, to 4,214 in December 2021.  The increase can, in part, be attributed to it being safer to travel to hospitals now that the frontlines have gone, but also misses a large number of malnourished children not taken to hospital because their families cannot afford the journey. Even if they could, they'd need to travel for hours on rubble roads, and it would be hard to find a medical facility that's not dysfunctional.   The Musa Qala and Gereshk district hospitals are overrun with malnourished children, but neither hospital has operational critical care. There are no female doctors. The hospital buildings are run-down, cold and dark. Electricity comes and goes. Night time temperatures drop to 4C.   In Gereshk a small heater hooked to a gas cylinder kept in the centre of the rooms provides barely any warmth. Mothers and babies sit huddled under blankets. The smell of disease hangs thick in the air.  At Musa Qala, when the breathing of another baby, one-and-a-half-year-old Walid, became irregular, he had to be carried through alleys and doorways to a decaying building next door which had the only oxygen cylinder we saw at the hospital.  The father of 10-day-old Zakiullah was sent out to find a saline drip solution in the market, because the hospital had no supplies.  Dr Aziz Ahmed who has worked at Gereshk hospital for more than a decade says they have few medicines and barely any staff, and yet have hundreds of patients coming in every day. They have to turn seriously ill children away because they don't have the facilities to help them, and Dr Ahmed says some have died before they got to a fully functioning hospital.   He and the other staff didn't receive salaries from August till October. From November, they and some other hospitals in the region have been receiving some payments through humanitarian organisations like Unicef, WHO (World Health Organization) and local charity Baran (Bu Ali Rehabilitation and Aid Network).  ""The humanitarian family is just trying to provide a survival bridge for these children while the world figures out the politics, but we cannot fully fund the health system,"" says Salam Janabi of Unicef.  ""Don't mix up children in politics. The moment here in Afghanistan is critical for children, and every decision the world makes, the politicians make, will impact them."" When you travel through Helmand province, destruction caused by war can be seen in almost every area. The scale of it in Sangin town is particularly shocking.  There are swathes of land covered with debris and mud, where once homes and shops had stood. These areas are where foreign and Afghan troops encountered some of their fiercest battles and where British soldiers were posted.   Abdul Raziq is from a community that has lived on the frontline for decades.  ""We are happy there is peace now, but we have no food, no work and no money. Wheat and fuel have become too expensive', he says.  ""Hundreds of children in my village are malnourished. In every house, you will find two or three. We have nothing to feed their mothers, that's why they're being born like this."" In a mud home nearby lives Hameed Gul. Two of his daughters, Farzana and Nazdana, are malnourished. Nazdana is so ill he's sent her to her grandparents because he's unable to feed her. His 10-year-old son Naseebullah has already begun to work on the fields to help out.  The unending suffering of his family is the legacy of foreign actions, present and past. Hameed's home was bombed in American airstrikes five years ago. Ten of his family, including his parents, six brothers and a sister were killed.  ""We had no connection with the Taliban. My house was unjustly bombed. Neither the Americans, the previous government or the new one offered to help me,"" Hameed says.   ""We eat just dry bread. About two to three nights a week, we go to bed hungry."" Everywhere we went, we asked what people had eaten that day. Most described sharing a few pieces of dry bread between whole families.   Children are the most vulnerable in this crisis of hunger. Afghanistan's youngest generation is being left to die.  In many of the areas we visited, malnutrition deaths might not even get recorded or counted. The world might never know the scale of the tragedy unfolding in Afghanistan."
"New Zealand border to reopen from next month, PM Ardern says",2022-03-16T01:24:03.000Z,"New Zealand has brought forward plans to reopen its borders to international travellers after a Covid lockout of more than two years. Australians will be allowed to enter the country without needing to quarantine or isolate from 13 April. Fully vaccinated travellers from about 60 countries on a visa-waiver list will be able to arrive from 2 May. Those nations include the UK and US. All arrivals will have to show a negative Covid test.  New Zealand shut its borders in March 2020 as the pandemic spread. They have remained closed, except for a short-lived travel bubble with Australia. Currently only New Zealand citizens are allowed in and out.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand was ""ready to welcome the world back"". ""We have now received guidance that it is safe to significantly bring forward the next stage of border reopening work, bringing back our tourists,"" she said on Wednesday. People who already have a visa - but are from outside the visa waiver list - will be eligible to enter the country on 1 May. While tough lockdowns and virtual isolation helped the country get a reputation as a Covid success story, transmission rates have soared recently.

It has recorded only 115 Covid deaths since the pandemic began.

The Western brands unable to leave Russia,2022-03-16T08:41:13.000Z,"The invasion of Ukraine has led many Western brands to shun Russia, but some still have outlets open in the country and say they are not able to shut them. Marks and Spencer, Burger King, and hotel groups Marriott and Accor are restricted by complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. The firms have outsourced the Russian businesses to third parties and do not own the operations bearing their name. Together the firms have almost a thousand outlets still open in Russia. M&S has 48 shops and Burger King has 800 restaurants still open, whilst Marriott and Accor have 28 and 57 hotels open respectively. The BBC understands the brands are locked into legal franchise agreements, making it difficult for them to remove their name from Russia's High Streets and shopping malls. A lot of Western firms have held such agreements for decades. For example, Marks and Spencer stores have been operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999. The retail giant has said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA in response to the war. Meanwhile, Burger King's owner Restaurant Brands International also told the BBC its restaurants are run by franchisees. These ""long-standing legal agreements are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future,"" it said. It is understood hotel groups Marriott, IHG and French chain Accor, which has Ibis and Novotel among its brands, are all operating in Russia under similar deals. Marriott told the BBC its hotels in Russia were owned by third parties but said it would ""continue to evaluate the ability for these hotels to remain open"", suggesting it was looking into its franchise agreements. Franchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company which has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company which pays a fee for the right to do business under the franchisor's name and sell its products. Graeme Payne, a specialist in UK and international franchising at law firm Bird&Bird, told the BBC franchising was useful to Western brands who want to enter markets in different countries, but do not have local knowledge, money, or ability to enter them. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia ""You would as a member of the publicâ¦ think why don't they just close their stores? But just from a pure business and contractual perspective, it's very difficult to do so without some far reaching legal consequences,"" said Mr Payne. Those consequences could have serious financial implications for Western businesses, who could be sued by franchisees if they did break any agreement, which are often 10 or more years long. Victoria Hobbs, a partner at Bird&Bird who deals with franchise disputes, told the BBC if a franchise owner was found to have links to Russian President Vladimir Putin or had been sanctioned, then from a UK perspective, a deal could be terminated. However, Ms Hobbs said although agreements often have a clause that states ""if the franchisee is doing something to damage our reputation we can terminate"", the problem currently in Russia is that many franchisees themselves are not doing anything wrong. ""It is quite challenging for them because, from an English law perspective, they don't really have a right to bring the agreement to an end - that's the problem,"" she said. Even if a brand managed to succeed in getting a UK court judgment against a franchise in Russia, ""the Russian courts wouldn't enforce it"", according to John Pratt, a partner at the largest team of specialist franchise lawyers in Europe. In the meantime, the firms are trying to do what they can to help with the situation and all have announced support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion. Accor, which has 57 branded hotels in Russia and 3,500 employees there, has suspended all future hotel openings and has stopped services and distribution to hotels affected by sanctions.Burger King is redirecting its profits from franchised operations in Russia to humanitarian effortsMarriott and IHG Hotels & Resorts, which each have 28 hotels operating in Russia under their brand, have also halted hotel developments and investments and have closed their corporate offices - which they own themselves and so have control over - in MoscowM&S has pledged more than Â£1.5m to support refugees and is donating 20,000 coats and thermals However, while many brands are stuck in Russia, Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was finalising an agreement with its main franchisee to temporarily halt Pizza Hut operations.  Ms Hobbs, partner at law firm Bird&Bird said she believed brands were ""very worried"" about any potential reputational damage from continuing to operate in Russia. ""They are worried obviously on a human and moral level about what is happening, but I also think they are worried [that] a number of companies have been threatened with boycotts."""
Heathrow Airport drops Covid face mask rules,2022-03-16T00:04:17.000Z,"The UK's largest airport has dropped mandatory face masks for passengers. Heathrow Airport no longer requires people to wear them in its terminals, railway stations or office buildings but will continue to recommend they do so. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are the latest airlines to relax their policies on face coverings. Passengers must still wear them on board flights if the country they're travelling to requires it. 'Plan B' measures ended in late January, meaning masks were no longer legally required on some public transport and in shops. However Heathrow, which handles a large number of international flights, had kept the rule that face coverings must be worn, until this week.  Heathrow's chief operating officer, Emma Gilthorpe, said the airport was pleased to move away from mandatory face mask requirements.  She said: ""While we still recommend wearing them, we can be confident the investments we've made in Covid-secure measures - some of which aren't always visible - combined with the fantastic protection provided by the vaccine will continue to keep people safe while travelling."" Heathrow said that if there was a significant rise in infections or a future variant of concern, it would not hesitate to bring the mandate back.  The airport said face coverings would remain available for people who still want to wear them.  All UK Covid travel rules to endScotland's mask rules will stay in force until AprilWhat are the UK's Living with Covid plans? Virgin Atlantic said it was also changing its face mask policy from Wednesday, making it a personal choice for customers and crew to wear them on board.  This will only happen on services where international regulations on mask-wearing do not apply. For now, that means flights between Heathrow and Manchester and destinations in the Caribbean such as Barbados, St Lucia and Antigua. The airline said customers may be asked to wear a mask when getting on and off planes and at destination airports. It highlighted that on routes to or from the US, masks would still be required until at least 18 April. Virgin Atlantic's chief customer and operating officer, Corneel Koster, said its policy would be introduced gradually. He encouraged passengers to respect each other's choices. From Wednesday, British Airways (BA) customers will only have to wear a face covering on board flights if the destination they're travelling to requires it.  BA's chief operating officer, Jason Mahoney, said the move was ""welcome"" and ""a positive step forward"". Earlier this month, the airline and tour operator Jet2 relaxed its rules on face coverings for flights to and from England and Northern Ireland. Since Friday, Tui has done the same.  Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said he would like to see the end of mandatory face masks by April or May. He added that cabin crew were being consulted. The aviation industry is hoping that the easing of travel restrictions will lift the curtain on a busy summer, after two years of major disruption due to the pandemic. From Friday, all travellers will be able to enter the UK without filling in a passenger locator form or taking Covid tests.   Holidaymakers will still need to be aware of, and follow, and rules where they're going. On Friday Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the recovery of aviation ""remains overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty"".    The airport's passenger numbers last month were still nearly 50% down on pre-pandemic levels.  However the airport is recruiting 12,000 staff to try and cope with demand during the summer peak.

Pregnant women should be asked how much they drink,2022-03-16T00:29:07.000Z,"Pregnant women should be asked how much alcohol they are drinking and the answer recorded in their medical notes, new ""priority advice"" for the NHS says.  The advice, from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), is designed to help spot problem drinking that can harm babies.  Infants with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) can be left with lifelong problems. The safest approach during pregnancy is to abstain from alcohol completely. Babies cannot process alcohol well - passed from mother to child through the placenta, it can stay in their body for a long time and stop them developing normally in the womb. Alcohol while pregnant is like Russian rouletteFASD: What it does to children There is no particular treatment for FASD - and the damage to the brain and organs such as the heart and kidneys is irreversible. The more someone drinks while pregnant, the higher the chance of FASD - and there is no proven ""safe"" level of alcohol. But the risk of harming the baby is ""likely to be low if you have drunk only small amounts of alcohol before you knew you were pregnant or during pregnancy"", the Department of Health says. And official statistics suggest one in 10 pregnant women says they have had some alcohol in the past week.  An earlier draft of the recommendations for NHS staff in England and Wales suggested transferring data on a woman's alcohol intake to her child's medical notes - but this has now been dropped, following concern women who needed help might hide their drinking. The Royal College of Midwives spokeswoman Lia Brigante said: ""As there is no known safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the RCM believes it is appropriate and important to advise women that the safest approach is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy and advocates for this.  ""We are pleased to see that the recommendation to record alcohol consumption and to then transfer this to a child's record has been reconsidered.  ""This had the potential to disrupt or prevent the development of a trusting relationship between a woman and her midwife.""  Claire Murphy, from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, stressed the vast majority of pregnant women drank below levels associated with harm. ""We remain concerned about the routine questioning of women throughout pregnancy on this issue,"" she said.  ""Our research shows women find antenatal discussions about alcohol - even when they don't drink at all - can supersede other issues important to them, like their own mental health and wellbeing.  ""Those supporting pregnant women must be able to provide care that meets the needs of the individual before them, not just to fill in boxes on a checklist."" Dr Paul Chrisp, director of NICE's centre for guidelines, said: ""This quality standard aims to improve the diagnosis and care offered to children and young people with FASD as well as ensuring that women are given consistent advice about their alcohol consumption during pregnancy. ""FASD is a series of preventable mental and physical birth defects associated with alcohol use during pregnancy.  ""Helping women to drink less or no alcohol during their pregnancy will reduce the number of children and young people affected by FASD."""
Government overseen years of decline in NHS - MPs,2022-03-16T00:17:31.000Z,"The government has overseen years of decline in cancer care and non-urgent hospital services in England, MPs say. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said services had started deteriorating long before the pandemic. It pointed out key targets had not been met since 2016 and the pandemic had just exacerbated the problems. But ministers said they were investing extra money and creating more capacity to treat patients, to address the backlog that had now developed. NHS waiting-list backlog will take years to clearHow the NHS wrestled with worst winter on record If you can't see the look-up, click here. More than six million people are currently on a hospital waiting list - one in nine of the population - the highest figure on record. This includes people waiting for operations such as knee and hip replacements. Meanwhile, just two-thirds of urgent cancer patients start treatment within the target time of 62 days. And the number of referrals for cancer care has dropped by between 240,000 and 740,000 since the pandemic started. The MPs said people would face serious health consequences because of delays in cancer treatment, with some dying earlier. The government is also accused of failing to recognise staffing the health service remains its biggest problem.  The MPs said the workforce was crippled by shortages and exhausted by two years of the pandemic. Dame Meg Hillier, who chairs the PAC, said: ""The Department for Health and Social Care has overseen a long-term decline that is dragging our NHS and the heroic staff down."" And she was ""extremely concerned"" there was still no real plan to tackle the problems. Last month, the government announced a recovery plan, with an extra Â£8bn being invested over the next three years, which ministers said would see 30% more patients treated. Crucial to this will be the establishment of a network of 160 community diagnostic centres along with surgical hubs focused on high-volume routine surgery away from major hospital sites - to increase efficiency and reduce the chance of emergency cases leading to cancellations. The Department for Health and Social Care defended its record, saying it had been investing extra money into services throughout the period and the new plan would have a real impact on waits."
Ukraine: Putin will search for a way to save face,2022-03-16T00:30:49.000Z,"Even the worst war comes to an end. Sometimes, as in 1945, the only outcome is a fight to the death. Mostly, though, wars end in a deal which doesn't satisfy anyone entirely, but at least brings the bloodshed to an end.  And often, even after the worst and most bitter conflicts, the two sides gradually resume their old, less hostile relationship. If we're lucky, we're beginning to see the start of this process happening now between Russia and Ukraine.  The resentment, particularly on the Ukrainian side, will last for decades. But both sides want and need peace: Ukraine, because its towns and cities have taken a terrible battering, and Russia, because it has already, according to the Ukrainian president, sacrificed more men and material than it lost in its two shockingly violent wars in Chechnya - although that is impossible to verify. But no-one willingly signs a peace agreement which is likely to lead to their own downfall.  For Russian President Vladimir Putin the search is on for ways of saving face. Ukraine's President Zelensky has already shown remarkable skill as a diplomat, and he's clearly willing to say and do whatever is acceptable to himself and his people in order to get Russia off his country's back.  For him, there's one overriding objective - to make sure that Ukraine comes out of this appalling experience a united, independent country, not a province of Russia, which is what President Putin originally seemed to think he could turn it into. For President Putin, all that counts now is that he can declare victory. No matter that everyone in his entire administration will understand that Russia has been given a bloody nose in this unnecessary invasion. No matter that the 20% or so of Russians who understand what's really going on in the world will know that Putin has bet the house on a fantasy of his own devising, and lost.  The battle will be for the support of the remaining majority of the population, who tend to believe implicitly what they're told on state television - even when there are moments such as the sudden popping-up on screen of the extraordinarily brave TV editor Marina Ovsyannikova with a placard to say that everything people are being told is propaganda. So what will make President Putin come out of this disastrous war looking good in the eyes of Russia's majority? Firstly, an assurance, perhaps even to be written into Ukraine's constitution, that it has no intention of joining Nato in the foreseeable future. President Zelensky has already prepared the way for this, by asking Nato for something it couldn't agree to (establishing  a no-fly-zone over Ukraine), then criticising the alliance for letting him down on this, and finally musing out loud that he wasn't sure that if Nato behaved like this, it was actually worth joining.  As clever and wise political positioning goes, it doesn't get much better than this. Nato gets the blame, which it can easily cope with, and Ukraine gets the freedom to act as it wants. But that's the easy bit. It'll be harder to finesse the urgent ambition which Zelensky and Ukraine have to join the EU, something Russia is almost equally hostile to, though there are ways around that too. Hardest of all for Ukraine to swallow will be Russia's outright theft of Ukrainian territory, in total defiance of the solemn international treaty it had signed to protect Ukraine's borders.  The loss of Crimea in 2014 is something Ukraine may well be forced to give its formal acceptance to, in some way. And Russia clearly intends to hang on to those areas in eastern Ukraine which are pretty much effectively under Russian control already - and perhaps more. In 1939, Joseph Stalin invaded Finland, which had once been part of the Russian empire. He was sure his troops would carve their way through it in no time - just as Putin thought about Ukraine in 2022. Stalin's generals, understandably terrified for their lives, promised him he was right. And, of course, he wasn't.  The Winter War dragged on into 1940, the Soviet army was humiliated, and Finland was left with a justifiable national pride in itself for resisting a superpower. It lost territory, because autocrats like Stalin and Putin need to come out of these things looking as though they've scored a victory. But Finland kept the most important, most imperishable thing: its full independence as a free, self-determining nation. As things stand today, Ukraine - having beaten off so many Russian attacks and made Putin's forces look feeble and ineffective - should be able to do that. Unless Putin's armies can capture Kyiv and much more of Ukraine's territory, then Ukraine will survive as a national entity, just as Finland did in 1940.  Losing Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine would be a bitter, illegal and wholly unjust loss. But Vladimir Putin would have to start using far more serious weapons even than he has already, if he's to come out on top. As things stand, in the third week of fighting, no-one can seriously doubt who the real winner in this war will be. John is the BBC's World Affairs editor.

War in Ukraine: What happened on day 20 of Russia's invasion,2022-03-15T22:30:02.000Z,"On day 20 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, residents in the capital Kyiv were placed under a 35-hour curfew - but that didn't stop the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic from travelling there by train. The trip was a Polish idea, after the EU warned of potential security risks.  The leaders decided to go by train because flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reported. It was not immediately clear when their train would make the return trip to Warsaw. Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki said history was being made in Ukraine's capital. ""It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance,"" he tweeted. Mr Morawiecki added that Ukraine could count on the help of its friends.  The prime ministers sat down for a briefing with their Ukrainian counterpart Denis Shmyhal, and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who thanked them for the ""powerful"" gesture of support.  They were accompanied to Ukraine by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party.  Russian artillery and warplanes are continuing to pound cities and towns across Ukraine. In Mariupol, a key port city in the south-east, hundreds of people crammed into the basement of a large public building are running out of food, with many also in need of urgent medical help, the BBC's Hugo Bachega was told. ""Some have developed sepsis from shrapnel in the body,"" said Anastasiya Ponomareva, a 39-year-old teacher who fled the city at the start of the war but is in contact with friends there. ""Things are very serious."" Her friends are with other families who spend most of their day in the basement. From time to time they go upstairs for sunlight, but rarely outside. They have all left homes that are no longer safe or no longer standing. At an intensive care hospital on the western outskirts of the city, staff described being treated like hostages by Russian forces. One employee was quoted as saying that Russian troops had ""forced 400 people from neighbouring houses to come to our hospital,"" adding: ""We can't leave."" The regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the facility had been all but destroyed by shelling in recent days, but that staff had continued to treat patients in the basement. Separately, about 2,000 cars were able to leave Mariupol along a humanitarian evacuation route, according to city authorities. Before the war around 400,000 people lived in the city, which has endured intense bombardment by Russian forces. The city council says well over 2,000 civilians have died. A cameraman and a journalist working for Fox News were killed when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, staff at the US network said. Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott described the deaths of Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and Oleksandra Kuvshinova, 24, as ""heart-breaking"". Their colleague, 39-year-old Benjamin Hall, was also wounded in the incident and taken to hospital. The attack followed the death on Sunday of 50-year-old US journalist Brent Renaud, who was shot and killed in the Ukrainian town of Irpin. The Russian journalist who protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme and shared a video describing the invasion as a crime was fined 30,000 roubles (Â£214; $280) and released. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel One, was detained on Monday after she ran onto the set holding a sign saying ""no war"". But concerns were later raised over her safety after reports that she could not be contacted. On Tuesday, however, she appeared at a court hearing. Ms Ovsyannikova told reporters afterwards that she had gone two days with no sleep, had been questioned for over 14 hours, and was not given access to legal help. Fears that US astronaut Mark Vande Hei - who has been in space for 355 days - might lose his lift back to Earth on board a Russian capsule were thankfully put to bed when it was confirmed he would indeed be making the trip home. The American, and two other Russian cosmonauts, will be brought back, landing in Kazakhstan. Joel Montalbano, Nasa's ISS programme manager, said: ""I can tell you for sure Mark is coming home... We are in communication with our Russian colleagues. There's no fuzz on that."" Meanwhile, as Western nations impose further sanctions on Russia, Moscow retaliated on Tuesday by slapping sanctions on US President Joe Biden and 12 other US officials. The list includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, press secretary Jen Psaki and other members of the administration. But there were also a couple of surprises on the list: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden's son, Hunter. The measures block their entry into Russia and freeze any assets held in the country.

Ukraine war: Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?,2022-03-16T00:32:03.000Z,"Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said he was moving his ""deterrent forces"" - meaning nuclear weapons -  to ""combat ready"" status.  This has raised fears that Moscow could use ""tactical"" nuclear weapons - not an all-out nuclear war, but still a dramatic development. Tactical nuclear weapons are those which could be used over relatively short distances.  This distinguishes them from ""strategic"" nuclear weapons. In the Cold War, these were the bombs which the two superpowers, the US and Soviet Union, could launch over long distances at each other's homeland.  The term ""tactical"" nevertheless incorporates many types of weapon, including smaller bombs and missiles used as ""battlefield"" weapons. Russia is thought to have about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons.  These can be placed on various types of missiles which are normally used to deliver conventional explosives. They can even be fired as artillery shells on a battlefield.  They have also been developed for aircraft and ships - for instance torpedoes and depth charges to target submarines.  These warheads are believed to be in storage facilities, rather than deployed and ready to fire.  But one concern is that Russia could be more willing to use smaller tactical weapons than larger strategic missiles.  ""They might not see it as crossing this big nuclear threshold. They could see it as part of their conventional forces,"" says Dr Patricia Lewis, head of the international security programme at the Chatham House think tank. Tactical nuclear weapons vary enormously in size and power.  The smallest can be one kiloton or less (equivalent to a thousand tonnes of the explosive TNT) - the larger ones perhaps as big as 100 kilotons.  The effects would depend on the size of the warhead, how far above the ground it detonates and the local environment. But as a comparison, the bomb that killed around 146,000 people in Hiroshima, Japan, during World War Two, was 15 kilotons.  Russia's largest strategic weapons are thought to be at least 800 kilotons. President Putin has made more than one reference to Russia's nuclear weapons - apparently to try to create a sense of fear. US spies see this as a signal to the West to persuade it not to intervene more in Ukraine, not as a sign he is planning nuclear war.  But others worry that even though the chances are low, it is possible Russia, in certain conditions, might be tempted to use a smaller tactical weapon in Ukraine. ""Putin is comfortable in the 'stability-instability' world, while the west is deterred by his nuclear bluster as if Nato's billion-dollar deterrent is nothing but a paper tiger,"" tweeted Dr Mariana Budjeryn, a nuclear expert with the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, at the Harvard Kennedy School. US intelligence say Russia has a theory called ""escalate to de-escalate"" if it is in a conflict with Nato. This involves doing something dramatic - such as using a tactical weapon on the battlefield, or as a demonstration somewhere - or threatening to do so. The idea is to frighten the other side into backing down. The concern is that if Putin feels cornered and that his strategy in Ukraine is failing, he could use tactical nuclear weapons as a ""game changer"", to break a stalemate or avoid defeat.   But the situation would likely have to get worse in Ukraine - or back in Russia - for him to consider this.  James Acton, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Pace in Washington DC, says: ""I am legitimately worried that in that circumstance Putin might use a nuclear weapon, most likely on the ground in Ukraine to terrify everyone and get his way. We are not at that point yet."" Dr Heather Williams, nuclear expert at Kings College London, says one problem is that it is unclear what ""winning"" in Ukraine would look like for Putin - and thus what might drive Russia to use a nuclear weapon. Putin claims Ukraine is part of Russia, so using nuclear weapons on its territory seems bizarre.  Russia itself is close by and ""the fallout could cross boundaries"", warns Patricia Lewis.  The only time nuclear weapons have been used in conflict was by the US at the end of World War Two against Japan. Would Putin want to become the first leader to break the taboo and use them?  Some worry he has shown a willingness to do things others thought he would not do, whether invading Ukraine or using nerve agent in Salisbury. Dr Williams says there is a further reason why Russia might not use nuclear weapons - China. ""Russia is heavily dependent on Chinese support, but China has a 'no first use' nuclear doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for China to stand by him. If he used them, he would probably lose China."" No one knows quite where the use of tactical nuclear weapons would lead. It could escalate and Putin would not want nuclear war. But miscalculation is always a risk. ""They would imagine everyone would capitulate,"" says Patricia Lewis. ""What would happen is that Nato would have to come in and respond."" The US says it is monitoring the situation closely.  It has an extensive intelligence gathering machine to watch Russian nuclear activity - for instance whether tactical weapons are being moved out of storage, or if there is any change in behaviour at launch sites.  So far, they say they have not seen any significant changes.   How the US and Nato would respond to any nuclear use is hard to predict. They may not want to escalate the situation further and risk all-out nuclear war but they also might want to draw a line.  This might mean a tough conventional rather than nuclear response. But what would Russia then do?  ""Once you have crossed the nuclear threshold, there is no obvious stopping point,"" says James Acton.  ""I don't think anyone can have any confidence of what that world would look like.""

Nigerian volunteer: 'Fighting in Ukraine is better than living here',2022-03-16T00:33:05.000Z,"When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last month, 27-year-old Nigerian Ottah Abraham was outraged. He picked up his phone and tweeted: ""I want to join the team."" He was some 8,700km (5,400 miles) away from the front line, in a small apartment in Nigeria's main city, Lagos. The philosophy graduate is one of several hundred Africans, from countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa and Algeria, who say they are willing to take up arms in the battle against Russia, partly to escape the bleak prospects faced by many young men at home.  ""We know that it's war, it's not child's play,"" he told the BBC. ""But being a soldier in Ukraine would be better than being here. ""I'll probably be allowed to stay if the war ends, plus I'll be a hero and fight an undeniable enemy."" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that some 20,000 volunteers from across the world had already applied to enlist. They came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a global appeal for foreign fighters to ""come and stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians"". The government has temporarily axed its visa requirements and offered equipment and a salary to those with a valid passport and military training. There has been no official confirmation that foreign fighters will be allowed to stay in the country after the war.  Kereti Usoroh, a Nigerian living in the capital, Abuja, said his motivations for volunteering had nothing to do with financial gain or the prospect of citizenship. ""I already live a comfortable life. If I wanted to go to Europe, I'd do it through education, not war,"" the 29-year-old lawyer said. ""This is about beating a bully - injustice for one is injustice for all."" Sentiments to gladden the hearts of Ukrainian diplomats and days after President Zelenksy's appeal, dozens of hopeful volunteers headed to the Ukrainian embassy in Abuja, with ambitions of enlisting. But the Ukrainian embassy in Nigeria - like others in Africa - has had to back-pedal as many of the continent's governments do not want their nationals to fight in Ukraine. ""Nigeria discourages the use of mercenaries anywhere in the world and will not tolerate the recruitment,"" Nigeria's foreign ministry wrote in a statement. Bohdan Soltys, a Ukrainian embassy official in Nigeria, said they were not paying Africans to fight - and people would have to pay for their own flights to reach Europe. ""There's a fine line between foreign volunteers and mercenaries,"" he told the BBC.  He later clarified that he had been instructed to turn away any volunteers who arrived at the embassy.  Senegal also warned its citizens against enlisting in the war and ordered the Ukrainian ambassador to take down a Facebook post that had called for Senegalese volunteers, calling the recruitment effort ""illegal and punishable by law."" The Algerian foreign ministry issued a similar order to its Ukrainian embassy. ""My country says I'm not allowed to go. I tried writing to the foreign ministry. They didn't answer me, but I will try again,"" 28-year-old Algerian Belhadj Hani Amir told the BBC. ""I want to go to Ukraine, but I also hope this war ends as soon as possible.""   Ukraine's ambassador to South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana Liubov Abravitova told the BBC that hundreds of people from across southern African had volunteered to fight or work in a humanitarian capacity - but she was unable to act on their requests as she was waiting for instructions from their governments. South Africa has a strict law against mercenaries. In fact, Ukraine's official website for recruiting the ""international legion"" of volunteers, which provides the contact details of local embassies around the world, no longer includes missions in African countries.  A representative working for the website confirmed that some African countries were removed because of ""regulatory restrictions"".  Algeria, Senegal and South Africa were among 17 of Africa's 54 countries which abstained from the vote at the UN to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, as they wanted to avoid antagonising Russia.  And Russia is not without support in Africa. It has expanded its influence on the continent - especially militarily, by helping countries like the Central African Republic (CAR), Libya, Mali and Sudan fight rebels or Islamist militants.  A video purporting to show soldiers from CAR vowing to join their ""Russian brothers"" has also been circulating online, though the BBC could not independently verify the source and a government official has not responded to a request for comment. Last Friday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that ""over 16,000 fighters"" from the Middle East had volunteered to fight with the Russian army - it is not clear if this includes any from North Africa. But with African governments clamping down on the recruitment of their own citizens, it is unclear if any of the men will make it to the front line - and a Ukrainian official in charge of registering foreign volunteers told the BBC that no Africans had arrived. For some, like David Osagie Adeleke from Nigeria's south-western Oyo state, this was a devastating blow. The 21-year-old, who has worked as an emergency rescue worker for the Red Cross, had been preparing to enlist as a combatant, having collected the necessary documentation, including a letter of recommendation.  ""I went straight to the police station to collect my documents,"" he said, explaining that a clean criminal record was one of the requirements for enlisting. ""I'm disappointed to hear that the embassy is now saying it won't take us Africans."" With his emails to the Ukrainian embassy now bouncing back, he is looking into alternative routes to get to the country's border. ""I've got an interview with the Polish embassy in Nigeria,"" he said. Prince Nkem Nduche, who was among those at the Ukrainian embassy in Abuja, has more knowledge than most about the situation in Ukraine and is more sanguine. He actually spent some time in Russia as a youngster, has dual citizenship and even enrolled at Russia's military academy - but was jailed for a short time, accused of being a spy after he was spotted at the American embassy. He said he fled the country seven years ago, via Ukraine - and would happily fight against Russia, but accepts it is not to be. ""I wanted to go on my own but as the Nigerian government said we can't goâ¦ I will obey them,"" he told the BBC.

Newspaper headlines: Zelensky's 'Nato concession' as Putin 'turns to Plan C',2022-03-16T00:51:03.000Z,"The war in Ukraine continues to dominate the front pages, with The Times leading on President Zelensky's admission that Ukraine is unlikely to be able to join Nato. Addressing a meeting of northern European leaders on Tuesday, Mr Zelensky said Nato's ""open door"" appeared to be closed to Ukraine and that this ""must be acknowledged"". The front also features a picture of a mother and daughter currently making their way to the UK. They will be among the first to be granted entry under a new refugee sponsorship scheme. The Telegraph similarly leads on President Zelensky's comments, calling them a ""significant concession that opened the way for a potential peace deal with Russia"". Alongside, there is a picture of Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at a Russian state broadcaster, leaving court after receiving a fine for speaking out against the war in Ukraine. The Express describes President Zelensky's Nato concession as a ""glimmer of hope"" as the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol remains under siege and the death toll from the conflict continues to rise. It also reports that a total of 122,000 Britons have so far offered to house Ukrainian refugees. Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox A picture of the family of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been held in Iran for the last six years ago, makes the front page of the Guardian. It follows news that she could be released within days. The paper also reports on a new 35-hour curfew in Ukrainian capital Kyiv after it says at least five people were killed in the latest Russian bombardment. The Mail's front page describes Ukraine capital Kyiv as a ""city of fear and defiance"". It says citizens in the city now wake to the sound of ""thunderous air strikes"" but they are preparing to face down Russian forces with ""awesome fortitude"". 'Putin turns to Plan C', reads the front page of the i. The paper reports that Russia is preparing for a ""war of attrition"" involving sustained bombing of cities and infrastructure. It also reports on a visit to Kyiv by the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. The Financial Times says that the West is ""turning up the heat on Moscow"" following a raft of new sanctions. The paper reports that the EU has added names including that of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to an asset freeze and travel ban, while the UK has imposed sanctions on more than 370 oligarchs. In the US, the state department has announced measures against 11 senior figures in Russia's defence sector. ""You're not blinging anymore,"" the Metro tells Russia's richest. The paper reports that in the UK the new sanctions will include a ban on the export of luxury goods, including high-end cars, fashion and art, to Russia. It also says that Mr Abramovich is thought to have returned to Moscow on a private jet after he was spotted at an Israeli airport. The Sun reports that Woody Johnson, the billionaire owner of American football team The New York Jets and the former US ambassador to the UK, wants to make a last-minute bid to buy Chelsea. The paper says Mr Johnson hopes to ""steal the deal"" from a Saudi group before the Friday deadline. And the Star's front page tells the story of a President Zelensky lookalike who has reportedly escaped Ukraine with the help of lookalikes of Russian president Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.

Stormzy tour review: Star praises fans who waited two years to see him,2022-03-16T01:56:06.000Z,"""This is that expensive rap,"" says Stormzy, half-way through the track Rachael's Little Brother. ""It's coming like a dying art."" The lyric isn't a monetary reference, he's explained, but a metaphor for the sort of ""classy, skilled, catching-all-the-pockets"" lyricism he aspires to. And yetâ¦ he's not afraid to loosen the purse strings when circumstances demand. Take, for example, the star's first UK arena tour, which hit Newcastle on Tuesday night.  Put together by the teams behind BeyoncÃ©'s historic Coachella set and Stormzy's 2019 Glastonbury performance, it's a lavish, no-corners-cut, stage and light show that asserts the Stormzy's status as the country's biggest rapper. This is the sort of show that makes room for pyrotechnics in almost every song; alongside a 12-piece band, a two-pronged catwalk, five budget-busting video screens and - symbolism ahoy - a serpentine lighting rig that twists into the shape of a crown. But for all that spectacle, the main focus is the man born Michael Owuo Jr - from the moment he emerges on a swaying platform, high above the arena floor; to the closing bars of Vossi Bop, where his vocals are drowned out by 11,000 phone-wielding fans. Stormzy tears up the stage at GlastonburyStormzy and HSBC fund 30 black Cambridge studentsStormzy leaves record label to sign with Def Jam He opens the show with a trio of his fiercest songs - Big Michael, Audacity and Know Me From - high-stepping through fireworks as he whips the crowd into a frenzy. For the first half an hour, he's the only person on the stage, his charismatic swagger the show's sole source of energy (if it could be bottled, it could presumably solve the fuel crisis). Acknowledging that all eyes are on him, the ultra HD video screens emphasise his lyrics - especially on the punchy First Things First, which tackles everything from depression to institutional racism, via the demonisation of UK rap and his love of Adele. After six songs, Stormzy switches up the pace with a stirring gospel-soul section that introduces a full live band, featuring no less than six backing singers. They lead us through the star's more contemplative songs (Crown, Superheroes, Do Better) while adding a late-night urgency to the sensually-charged Cigarettes & Cush. As the tempo slows, the star lets out his playful side, flirting with the crowd and busting out some surprisingly supple dance moves.  ""We're going to create some memories tonight,"" he declares. ""I want everyone to leave here with a little bit of joy in their heart."" To be brutally honest, the slow-groove soul revue outstays its welcome by at least two songs - and it's a relief when Stormzy ratchets the energy back up with the ferociously articulated Wiley Flow (the line ""I can't drop the bag, I am the bag,"" remains a highlight of his discography). The pace doesn't falter after that, as the star races through his biggest hits - Clash, Big For Your Boots, Blinded By Your Grace, Shut Up and Vossi Bop.  Some of these are performed inside a giant, oscillating scale of justice (which, like the metaphor, went completely over my head). Others are delivered, to maximum audience approval, while wearing a Newcastle United t-shirt that's been thrown onstage. Throughout the show, Stormzy is in jubilant form, turning the Utilita Arena into a giant shoobz, or all-out grime party. For many in the audience, it was their first concert since the Covid lockdowns - a fact that wasn't lost on the star. ""A lot of you bought a ticket two years ago, so to see you here today is a real thing,"" he said.  ""The past two years for meâ¦ I've done a lot of growing as a man and I've been making music, and I've been chilling, and I've been spending time with my family, and I've been so away from everything.  ""So even driving to the arena and seeing everybody waiting outside, I was like, 'We're still here man, we're still alive.' I love you guys."" And for all the expense and all of the spectacle, that's what endears Stormzy to his fans: The humanity of his music and his actions. That's why the best moment of this, the first full show of his 2022 tour, came after the music finished and the house lights went up.  Instead of being whisked away to a velvet-roped VIP area, Stormzy climbed off the stage and spent time with the people who'd waited two years to see him. The crowd frequently threatened to swallow him whole - but he was undeterred, shaking hands and posing for selfies for as long as time would allow. It was a personal gesture of gratitude; a sign that, for all of his stature, Stormzy knows where his power comes from.  And he repaid that debt by announcing his forthcoming third album to them first - not on social media, or in an exclusive interview with Rolling Stone, but in a video played exclusively to the fans in the arena. This is that expensive rap, and it's coming like a dying art.

The neighbourhood leading a green energy revolution,2022-03-16T03:14:13.000Z,"An ambitious target of using hydrogen to partly power homes in the UK within three years has been set by the National Grid, the BBC has learned. On the east coast of Scotland, a small neighbourhood is playing a key role in this energy revolution.  From next year, about 300 homes in Buckhaven, and Methil, in the area of Levenmouth, will be powered by green hydrogen gas in a project called H100. Customers will be offered free hydrogen-ready boilers and cookers in the scheme, which will initially last five and a half years. For the first time in its history, the National Grid (NG) plans to use something other than natural gas in its distribution network and start blending hydrogen with natural gas in the next three years. Yet, standing in the former Fife coal mining village of Buckhaven as a cold wind howls round buildings made of local grey stone, it's hard to imagine this is the centre of a groundbreaking experiment working towards the NG's ambitions. But as soon as you walk towards Buckhaven waterfront, it's impossible to ignore. A 200-metre wind turbine, astonishing in its size and generating green energy, stands just off the coast, making a loud swoosh every couple of seconds, as the wind is picked up and thrown into the sea. The region has a long, proud history of energy production from its mines, but now the focus is on more environmentally friendly natural resources. The huge wind turbine will generate electricity to power an electrolyser, which turns water into hydrogen gas and oxygen. The hydrogen will then be stored in pressurised secure tanks, before being pumped into people's homes. The Â£28m project, partly funded by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), has the capability to be expanded to 1,000 homes from the same turbine. Heating properties is thought to account for up to a third of UK carbon emissions, and the project hopes to save more than 2,650 tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to half the homes taking their cars off the road. Such projects are not seen as the solution by all. Recently, MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said the government's approach to decarbonising home heating lacked clear direction. They said current policies were not on the scale required, and rejected hydrogen as a main solution for greener home heating. Meanwhile in Buckhaven, fitness instructor Caroline Cunningham, who has signed up to the project, can see the turbine from her front room. ""It's super-exciting,"" she says. ""Something that's literally a few hundred metres away from where I live, is going to send power and energy to the housing system."" Cut fossil fuels to lower gas bills, advisers say Many people still in the dark over gas boilers, say MPsHomeowners to help pay Â£33bn to decarbonise heatingHow will Scotland heat its homes in the future? Rising gas prices and the war in Ukraine have almost doubled Ms Cunningham's bills in just 12 months, and despite paying the same for hydrogen gas as natural gas, she thinks it will bring them down in the long term. ""Hopefully we can get a more sustainable and a more stable energy source through hydrogen energy. And of course, it's good for the environment as well,"" says Ms Cunningham, who thinks Buckhaven leading the world on renewable energy for heating and cooking will also give new life to an area that has been dominated by the coal industry for the past century. ""I think we've taken a lot from the world and it's time that we move forward now on different types of energy sources, like the hydrogen energy."" The east coast of Scotland is famous for its wind, but the town's location close to the sea - and its range of properties - made access for installing pipework simpler. Angus McIntosh, from energy company SGN, is leading the H100 Fife project. He believes hydrogen has the ability to reduce bills in the long term.  Currently the cost of producing low-carbon hydrogen is more expensive than buying natural gas, but Mr McIntosh believes that is about to change. ""Scotland is blessed with a lot of wind and a lot of rain and also natural resources,"" he explains. ""It's got all the ingredients to become a hydrogen exporter, as well as more than enough hydrogen to supply its people."" Yet with industrial hydrogen production hubs still to be completed, academics doubt that this would currently work on a much larger scale. Mr McIntosh believes the project can ""absolutely"" be scaled up: ""One of the things you've got to do to generate the interest in hydrogen production is create that market,"" he says. The project aims to prove that hydrogen is attractive to customers, while work is also taking place to map out the system transformation across the UK. The NG's plan is to start blending at small percentages of hydrogen in 2025, but it aims to get up to 20% as soon as the hydrogen is available. The UK government is aiming to achieve 5GW ofâ¯low-carbonâ¯hydrogen production capacity by 2030 for use across the economy. This is the equivalent to the amount of gas consumed by more than three million households in the UK each year. To do this, blue hydrogen will be required - this is where carbon is captured by filtration of natural gas. The carbon is then often buried under the sea. Environmentalists suggest this is flawed, as natural gas is still being used despite it being described as low-carbon hydrogen, of which there is no official definition. Tony Green, hydrogen director at the NG, explains: ""Blending is taking the natural gas we have today in the network, starting with a small quantity of hydrogen, it's just another gas, we mix it up and push that down the network instead. The user won't notice any difference at all at low levels, and we will just build that level up over time."" Some of the network's biggest pipelines, which usually carry methane across the 5,000 mile network to homes and businesses, are being tested to blend hydrogen. Eventually the grid wants to replace natural gas  Mr Green believes there will be a point when natural gas is no longer used in the network, replaced with low-carbon hydrogen, either produced from wind or where natural gas is steamed and the CO2 emissions captured and stored. ""The beauty of hydrogen is that we can store it, and when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, we can keep hold of the energy and run it around our network,"" he says. But Dr Katriona Edlmann, a researcher on hydrogen funded by the University of Edinburgh, believes it could be the 2030s before green hydrogen is on a par cost-wise with fossil fuels. ""There's no denying we have a very big challenge ahead of us. The current generation is very minimal - even globally only 4% of our hydrogen is generated from green hydrogen - so there's a lot to do,"" she says. ""We just need to make it bigger, we need to do more of it. We need to create the hydrogen market which we can do through blending, and as the market grows, industry will invest in this. Industry will come, they will do the work. If the market is there, the hydrogen will be generated. But we're not quite there yet."""
Brittney Griner: How can a US basketball star just vanish?,2022-03-16T08:14:41.000Z,"She's arguably the greatest female basketball player of all time, and she's been detained in Moscow amid the war in Ukraine. Fans want to know why more people aren't paying attention. In one of the last public sightings of Brittney Griner, captured on CCTV, the American professional basketball player is seen walking through airport security trailing a small, black suitcase.  Ms Griner, a star centre for the Phoenix Mercury, had landed at the Sheremetyevo airport, outside Moscow, there to play another season with a Russian league.  In the security footage, she wears running shoes, black sweatpants and a black hoodie with ""Black Lives for Peace"" written on the back, her dark hair hanging in locs down past her shoulders.  At 6ft 9in - tall even by basketball standards - she towers above the customs agents and other travellers. In another shot, she is seen sitting in front of a man, seemingly a customs agent, shaking her head ""no"". Then, nothing - until a Russian mugshot emerged on state television last week. Ms Griner, 31, is believed to have been arrested by Russian authorities on drug charges.  A month after her detention, little is known about her circumstances. The uncertainty around her fate has fuelled an outpouring of support for the player, who is considered by fans and sports analysts alike to be perhaps the greatest female basketball player of all time.  And it has also engendered a sense of outrage among some fans who say the response to Ms Griner's detainment has been strangely muted. Fans and experts say that the attention she's been given in comparison to male players exposes longstanding gender inequities in professional sports.  ""If this was an NBA [professional men's league] player of her calibre... this would be on the cover of not only every sports page but every news media page in the world,"" said Tamryn Spruill, a sports journalist who is writing a book on the WNBA and Ms Griner's contributions to the league.  Ms Griner, a nine-year veteran of the league - is the ""best of the best"", said Melissa Isaacson, a sportswriter and professor at Northwestern University in the US state of Illinois.  ""She's every bit the Tom Brady of her sport,"" Ms Isaacson said. ""You could argue very accurately that she is one of the best athletes in the world.""  A native of Houston, Texas, she earned a basketball scholarship to Baylor University where she led the team to a national championship.  She is now one of the WNBA's most dominant players in history, widely considered the best offensive player in the league. Few have accomplished what Ms Griner has done - winning a college championship, WNBA and Euroleague titles and an Olympic gold medal. And, famously, her ability to dunk is unmatched. Off the court, she has also been seen as a trailblazer, coming out as gay at age 22, just around the time of her entry into professional sport. She then became the first overall draft pick in the WNBA that year and, soon after, the first openly gay athlete to be endorsed by Nike.  ""Before Griner, there was this shadow over the league, where it was like 'don't say gay,'"" Ms Spruill said. ""And she was just like 'screw that, this is who I am'.""   ""BG's always been one to be a pioneer,"" Griner's teammate, Diana Taurasi has said.  Despite all this, Ms Griner had a second job, and that was why she had flown to Russia - to play for EuroLeague team UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she had worked since 2014 during the US off-season.  Roughly half of WNBA players compete overseas in the off-season. For most, it's a way to augment their domestic income: WNBA players receive roughly five times more in Russia than they do in the US.  ""If she were Steph Curry or LeBron James, she wouldn't be over there at all because she'd be making enough money,"" Ms Spruill said.   Ms Griner's counterparts in the men's league make more than 200 times the maximum WNBA salary.  Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the EuroLeague suspended all Russian teams and US and WNBA officials began calling players out of the country. But it was too late for Brittney Griner, who is believed to have entered Russia one week earlier, on 17 February, though the timing remains unclear.  The Russian Federal Customs Service said in a press release that a sniffer dog had led authorities to search the carry-on luggage of an American basketball player and that it had found vape cartridges containing hashish oil. A state-owned Russian news agency, Tass, identified the player as Ms Griner.  Russian authorities only confirmed her detention the third week of March, though they disclosed she was stopped at the airport in February. Where she is being held, and under what circumstances, is not publicly known. US authorities and representatives for Brittney Griner have been mostly silent except to say they are working to bring her home.  A state department spokesperson confirmed the player's detention, telling the BBC they were ""aware of and closely engaged on this case"".  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that American officials are ""doing everything we can"" to help her. ""There's only so much I can say given the privacy considerations at this point,"" Mr Blinken said.  Ms Griner's agent, Lindsay Colas, has said she was in ""close contact"" with the player and her lawyer in Russia, but could not comment further.  While there is no indication that Ms Griner's arrest was connected to the invasion of Ukraine, some US officials have indicated strained US-Russian relations may jeopardise her safe return. ""We don't want Ms Griner to become a pawn in the political battle that's being waged throughout the world right now,"" said US congressman John Garamendi, a member of the House of Representatives' armed services committee.  ""The war in Ukraine has essentially severed diplomatic ties between the US and Russia,"" Mr Garamendi said. ""That is going to exacerbate this issue.""  Russia has so far blocked consular access to Brittney Griner for the US embassy, he said. She could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted on drug charges.  The US embassy in Russia did not respond to a request for comment.  As Ms Griner nears the end of what is believed to have been a month in detention, some fans have been left incredulous by an apparent lack of attention for a world-class athlete in prison among sports media.  Some have speculated that the silence may be intentional - an effort to avoid inflaming an already precarious situation amid negotiations with Russia. But others, like Ms Spruill, say the somewhat muffled coverage on Ms Griner lays bare the clear inequities faced by female athletes.  Much more ink has been devoted to male players - whether it is American football player's Tom Brady's on-again, off-again retirement, Novak Djokovic's Covid saga in Australia, or Aaron Rodger's vaccination status - than to Brittney Griner, Ms Spruill points out. Nearly 60,000 fans have signed an online petition, organised by Ms Spruill, demanding the US government prioritise her safe return and treat her like ""any other sports icon"".  ""There has absolutely not been enough coverage,"" Ms Spruill said. ""It's hard for me to read that other than a choice by the broader media.""  Ms Griner's wife, Cherelle, posted on Instagram last week about the painful wait.  ""People say 'stay busy.' Yet, there's not a task in this world that could keep any of us from worrying about you. My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by,"" she wrote.  ""There are no words to express this pain. I'm hurting, we're hurting""."
Ukraine war: The women tracing missing relatives,2022-03-16T00:24:49.000Z,"Thousands of families have been separated in the chaos of fighting in Ukraine. Power cuts and disruption to internet and mobile phone services mean many have gone weeks without hearing news of loved ones in areas hit by intense Russian shelling. Sergey was sheltering with his family in a bomb shelter when he left to get food. Fierce fighting meant he couldn't get back to them, and the next day his phone went dead. Desperate for news, his brother Vladimir turned to a Telegram group set by a Ukrainian TV presenter which shares information about missing people.  The group, called Search for the Missing, has grown to more than 80,000 members since it launched earlier this month, and receives thousands of pleas for help every day. Hours after he posted about his brother, and four days after Sergey went missing, Vladimir got a phone call from the family of Sergey's wife in Kyiv, who had seen the message. ""By the end of the day, they called to tell me that my brother had made his way to them,"" Vladimir said.  Sergey had made it to another shelter, but with no food and water, he and the people he was with decided to surrender to Russian troops. ""They took a white flag and went out to the Russians. After a search, they were released. Then with the help of volunteers, he drove to Kyiv,"" Vladimir says. The rest of Sergey's family eventually made it out of Bucha and to safety in Gdansk, Poland. ""I experienced feelings that I have never experienced in my life,"" Vladimir says. ""It was such welcome news in these difficult days."" Sergey has since returned to Ukraine to join the army, he says. Search for the Missing was started by Katya Osadcha, a former model, journalist and popular reality TV presenter. She was desperate to help when the war started, but felt she ""couldn't shoot or be a soldier"" because she has two small children.  Instead, she asked friends on Instagram to help and now she and 15 volunteers run the group 24 hours a day, checking each message for details, and filtering out duplicates. 'Overwhelmed' Katya says they have helped about 300 people find missing relatives, each one a happy update - a flurry of red hearts, praying and crying emojis - among the channel's endless stream of desperate pleas for information. ""You receive pictures of happy people on holidays, and their friends and family are writing to us saying that they are missing and the last call was five days ago from a shelter, and there has been a lot of bombing."" Emma Shymanovych, who helps run the channel, says the small team of volunteers has been overwhelmed: ""It's extremely painful to read enquiries about lost children, or about children looking for their parents. It's hard to express what we feel."" Yulia, 25, left her mother, brother and sister behind when she escaped the city of Mariupol with her husband and two-month-old baby: ""The last time I spoke to them, they had not had electricity, water, heating and communications for several days."" When she couldn't get through to them, Yulia contacted local authorities and friends who might still be in the city to see if they knew anything, but got nowhere, and posted on the Telegram channel. ""I push the worst thoughts away from me,"" she said. ""I really hope they're safe and they just don't have a connection. I only hope for an immediate ceasefire."" Not long after we spoke, Yulia sent me a message to tell me her mother had finally been able to make contact, but was still in Mariupol. ""She spoke for just a minute. Thank God!""  Iryna posted a picture of her friend's 23-year-old daughter Julia, after she went missing in Kyiv. ""Her mother was crying constantly,"" she says. She tried asking for news on Facebook and other Telegram channels, eventually turning to Search for the Missing. ""Within 24 hours I started getting responses from people who knew her. Some said they didn't know anything, but then her friends got in touch and said Julia had broken her phone and hadn't been able to make contact."" Julia had dropped her phone when she was running to a bomb shelter and she didn't know her mother's phone number off by heart.  Thousands more are still trapped in Mariupol. Olga, who lives in Istanbul, posted in the channel after losing contact with her 31-year-old daughter Daria and her two grandchildren Mark, 4, and Lydia, 5, who live there. Olga last heard from her daughter on 28 February. In a text message, Daria wrote that a shell had hit their apartment building, and there was no electricity or heating. ""I don't know what to do at all"" the message said. ""I'm scared. The children are dressed, there are a lot of blankets. Mariupol is encircled by the enemy. We have a very bad connection."" Olga has almost given up hope of hearing from them. Monday was her daughter's birthday. ""I'm terrified of everything and I never thought that my family would be affected by war"" she says.  Olga, from Bakhmut, posted in the group to try to find news of her daughter, Alice, and eight-month-old grandson, Timofey, in Mariupol. The last she heard from them, they were sheltering with neighbours in the basement of a supermarket without electricity, water or heating. Since then, she has received a message that the building they were hiding in was bombed, and she is anxiously waiting for more news. ""Whether they are alive and where they are now - I don't know."""

Church of England pressures TotalEnergies over Russia business,2022-03-16T02:13:05.000Z,"The Church of England is putting pressure on TotalEnergies over its decision not to cut business ties with Russia in the wake of its Ukraine invasion. The church's investment funds said they would reconsider their shareholding in the French energy giant. The two funds also called for the firm to urgently review its decision. TotalEnergies has condemned Russia's aggression, but has not followed BP and Shell in withdrawing from Russia.  The company did not respond to a request for comment. It was not immediately clear how large a stake the Church of England's Pensions Board and the Church Commissioners investment fund hold in TotalEnergies. They did not respond to requests for comment. In a joint letter to TotalEnergies chief executive, Patrick Pouyanne, the pension board and the Church Commissioners for England noted the company was at odds with the actions taken by many of its peers. Last month, the church's pensions board and the Church Commissioners fund dumped Â£20m worth of investments in Russian businesses. They also banned any further investments in the country. In a statement to The Times, the church said it made the move ""in response to the attack on Ukraine by Russia and supporting the sanctions announced by the UK and other governments"". The Church Commissioners manage a Â£9.2bn investment fund while the pensions board oversees a fund worth Â£3.7bn. In February, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said Russia's ""horrific and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is an act of great evil"".   The church's letter to TotalEnergies comes after two French NGOs - Greenpeace France and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) France - said they planned to take legal action against the oil giant over possible human rights abuses unless it cuts its business ties with Russia. Russia represented 24% of TotalEnergies' reserves and 17% of its combined oil and gas production in 2020, company documents show. Activist investor Clearway Capital has also written to the board of TotalEnergies asking it to exit its operations in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine."
"North Korea fires missile but launch fails, says South",2022-03-16T04:48:32.000Z,"North Korea has fired an ""unknown projectile"" which appeared to fail immediately after launch, South Korea's military said.  The suspected missile was fired from an airfield outside the capital Pyongyang. The airfield has been the site of several launches, including previous tests of what were the US alleges were intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). It comes as North Korea has in recent weeks stepped up its weapons testing.  ""North Korea fired an unknown projectile from the Sunan area around 09:30 today, but it is presumed that it failed immediately after launch,"" Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. Specialist news site NK News cited witnesses as saying loud ""blowing"" sounds, similar to that of a large aircraft, were audible in Pyongyang, followed by a loud ""crash"". It added that it had seen an image showing a red-tinted ball of smoke in the sky above the capital.  Speaking to NK News, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Ankit Panda said this image was consistent with that of a ""catastrophic failure"". He added that ""reddish-orange smoke"" is associated with liquid fuel - something that is ""very toxic"" to humans.  North Korea has so far carried out nine weapons tests this year, including what the US claims were tests of parts of a new ICBM, saying they were likely to have been experimental launches before a probable full-range ICBM launch.  With a minimum range of 5,500km (3,417 miles), ICBMs can reach the US. They are designed for nuclear arms delivery. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme The UN prohibits North Korea from ballistic and nuclear weapons tests, and has imposed strict sanctions.  The North had put a moratorium in place on testing long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear tests after talks with then US President Donald Trump. But in 2020, Mr Kim announced he was no longer bound by this promise. Pyongyang has however, maintained that the launches on 26 February and 4 March were focused on developing a reconnaissance satellite. Each launch does help scientists learn what works and what doesn't. But this is a big year for Kim Jong-un. It's his 10th year in charge, he will want success not failure. Also as one expert pointed out - at what point did this launch fail?  It was launched at the country's main airport, Sunan. Any major explosion near the ground could damage the airport.  And any explosion further up could risk debris falling on populated areas. We will know more after further analysis by US and South Korean defence ministries.  Either way, it is unlikely this failure will deter North Korea. Kim Jong-un has a wish list of weapons - he will press ahead."
Royal Society of Chemistry report says racism 'pervasive',2022-03-16T05:11:07.000Z,"Of the 575 chemistry professors in the UK, just one is black.  In the 15 years Robert Mokaya has been a professor at Nottingham university, he has had all his applications for funding for research projects turned down by Britain's main chemistry funding body, now called the UK Research and Innovation agency. ""That is not typical for a professor,"" he tells me phlegmatically.  ""I have had research papers published which I would have expected would have enabled me to obtain funding to do follow-up research. ""I wonder if this is typical for someone of my sort of surname.  ""It has been very, very difficult,"" he says. Funding applications are reviewed and decided by fellow experts in the field whose names are not published, but the name of the applicant is known to the reviewers. Despite the constant rejections of funding applications, Robert has done extremely well for himself. He is a noted materials chemist, specialising in the study of materials for sustainable energy storage and has had numerous publications in scientific journals.  He was able to do his research because of funding from charities and learned societies, such as the Royal Society, which funds only the researchers it judges to have a track record of excellence in their work.  Robert is currently a pro-vice-chancellor at Nottingham university and a trustee of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). The RSC has published an investigation which shows that racism is ''pervasive'' in the field. The report finds that it is ""hard to challenge"" and marginalisation of minorities has become ""normalised"" in universities and industry. The investigation also bears out Robert's experience, finding that minority ethnic researchers are less likely to get grant funding, promotions and are paid significantly less. In  2019/20 the average grant for a minority ethnic chemical sciences researcher was Â£320,000, compared with Â£355,000 for white colleagues. The RSC's chief executive, Dr Helen Pain, described the stories of discrimination she had seen as part of the investigation as ""shocking"". ""Racism is unfortunately a reality of chemical sciences, just as it is in wider society"" she told BBC News.  ""We need to do better. We need to make a difference. In response to the report, Prof Melanie Welham, UKRI's executive champion for people, culture and talent, told BBC News that the agency was reviewing its processes to address concerns about unequal treatment. ""We know we must do more, and we're committed to doing so."" ""This includes piloting and learning to embed effective practice on equality, diversity and inclusion in our expert review and assessment practices, such as through double-blind reviewing, and allowing applicants to evidence their contributions in a wider range of ways.  The RSC report also shows that ethnic minority students are interested in studying chemistry at university, but they are put off by what they perceive to be an unwelcoming atmosphere of academic research. This is especially true of black students and researchers. Official figures show that at undergraduate level 4.9% of students studying chemistry-related subjects identify as black, significantly higher than the national 3.0% of the UK population. But most choose not to enter research. Those who do fall away at every stage of the career ladder: 1.4% of postgraduate chemistry researchers identify as black, 1% of lecturers and 0% of professors. ""I don't exist!"" laughs Robert. There are no black professors in the official statistics because the number 1 is rounded down to zero for accounting purposes. Robert's good humour subsides, though, as he tells me about his journey to becoming the UK's only black chemistry professor. He says: ''It has been a struggle."" ""In academia you have to get signals from more senior colleagues that it is time to apply for a more senior role that comes up. Early in my career the signals I got is that this is not the place for you and it is not the right time for you. ''This was the most difficult part of my career and this is where the main blockage is for black chemists. Once I broke through and was networked it got better''. Sandile Mtetwa is a black PhD student at Cambridge University. She co-founded a group for African students studying science subjects. She says many of them have decided not to struggle through. Instead they have decided to get jobs in the private sector because they felt there was ""prejudice"", and they would not be supported if they went into academic research. ""The chemical sciences community is so network driven. You have to know someone to get on,'' she tells me. ''Someone senior has to support you, to help you get a position, to get a grant. If someone up there is not cheering for you, you can't do much about it"". The RSC report says that there is little incentive for chemistry organisations to improve. Most initiatives are voluntary and appear to be having a limited impact, it says.  It finds that just 21 universities out of the 93 that signed up for the award hold a bronze Race Equality Charter award, run by the higher education charity Advance HE. None have received a silver or gold award, despite the scheme being launched in 2016. Similarly, 37% of FTSE 100 companies have no representation of minority ethnicities on their board, despite a target set by an independent review, also in 2016, to have one director from a minority ethnic background on every board by 2021. The RSC has launched a race and ethnicity unit to push for change in organisations. It has also set up a five-year mentoring scheme to help school leavers follow to chemistry-focused degrees and is working with employers to provide ethnic minority students with job opportunities and to help them with their career progression.  Robert Mokaya says he hopes that these initiatives will bring about changes for the next generation of ethnic minority chemical scientists.  ""I am concerned for those coming through the system.  ""I don't think it is fair that those who get to a senior position in chemical sciences should have to go through what I have had to go through."" Follow Pallab on Twitter"
Ukraine: The volunteers racing aid from the UK to the front line,2022-03-16T06:01:59.000Z,
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori on way home to UK,2022-03-16T18:43:53.000Z,"British-Iranian nationals Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori will be reunited with their families in the UK after being freed from Iran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe will return to her husband and seven-year-old daughter Gabriella - who plans to show her mother her new toys. ""It's going to be the beginning of a new life,"" Richard Ratcliffe said. Mr Ashoori's family said they could now rebuild the foundations of their family with their ""cornerstone back in place"". In a statement, they hailed his release and return to the UK after ""five long years"" before thanking those who worked to bring him home. A second man, Morad Tahbaz, who has Iranian, UK and US nationality, has been released from prison but is not yet allowed to leave Iran. Speaking in the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss paid tribute to the ""incredible resolve and determination"" shown by Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Mr Ashoori, Mr Tahbaz and their families, saying the ""agonies"" they endured ""must never happen again"". Ms Truss said ministers would keep working to secure Mr Tahbaz's release. The government has said it also settled a debt of almost Â£400m owed to Iran from the 1970s, with the funds ring-fenced solely for humanitarian purposes. Speaking in the Commons, Tulip Siddiq - Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP - said: ""Can I say to Nazanin, welcome home, after six long years. And can I say to Gabriella, this time mummy really is coming home."" Paying tribute to Mr Ratcliffe, who watched from the public gallery with Gabriella, Ms Siddiq said he had ""really set the bar high for husbands"" in his efforts to secure his wife's release. Why has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe been freed now?Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?Fate of Iran's jailed dual nationalsDid tank debt cost Nazanin's freedom? Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been held in Iran since 2016 - accused of plotting to overthrow Iran's government, which she denied. Mr Ashoori was arrested in 2017 and accused of spying, a claim he denied. Cuddling his daughter, Gabriella, Mr Ratcliffe told journalists they would really believe the news when they saw ""Mummy"". He said he wanted to thank people ""up and down the country"" for supporting his campaign for her release, which included a hunger strike last October. ""Ours has been a cruel experience in some ways, but it's also been an exposure to such a level of kindness and care,"" he said. ""This will be a chapter in our lives, but there are many more chapters to come."" Speaking after hearing MPs speak in the House of Commons, he told the Press Association the family would ""be away for a couple of days recuperating, doctors and check-ups and so on"". He said on returning to their home, the first thing his wife wanted to do was ""sit down on the sofa, make a cup of tea, and just be in the living room together"" and that he looked forward to ""pottering around the neighbourhood and be[ing] normal again"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been under house arrest and was given her UK passport back this week. Mr Ashoori's wife Sherry Izadi told the BBC that he was determined to put his ordeal behind him and return to normal life as soon as possible. She said on his return to the UK he would most be looking forward to hugging his family and his first beer. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori were flown from Tehran to the capital of Oman, Muscat, and have since left on a plane to the UK. On Wednesday evening, Ms Siddiq tweeted a new photograph of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on the last leg of her journey. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Antonio Zappulla, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation where Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe worked as a project manager, said staff were ""overjoyed"" at news of her release. He said she had endured ""utterly inhumane treatment"" over the past six years, including being ""denied her freedoms, separated from her husband and young child, battling significant illness, thrown in solitary confinement"". But he added that her freedom was ""a ray of light and hope"" at a time when the world was ""in turmoil and the news has been consistently bleak"". There have been repeated attempts to secure Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release - all failed. So why is she now on her way home? The basic answer is London-Tehran relations are better than they have been. There was almost a deal last year but since that fell through British diplomats have visited Iran several times to try to reach a fresh agreement. Iranian officials at their Ministry of Foreign Affairs were frequently frustrated that this dispute got in the way of the rest of the UK-Iran relationship. But the Iranian diplomats were not in charge - the International Revolutionary Guard and the judges were. Eventually, enough people with the Iranian government seemed to have realised that a permanently hostile relationship with the UK was not in Tehran's best interests. That might apply directly to talks taking place in Vienna, designed to revive the agreement under which Iran limited its nuclear activities in return for seeing economic sanctions lifted. You can read more here. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""fantastic"" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been freed and could return to her family and that he was also ""thrilled"" for Mr Ashoori and Mr Tahbaz. A Â£393.8m debt relating to a cancelled order for 1,500 Chieftain tanks dating back to the 1970s had been linked to the continued detention of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other UK-Iranian dual nationals held in the country - although the government had previously said the two issues should not be connected. Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Anoosheh had been freed on ""humanitarian grounds"" and that it would be ""wrong"" to link the UK's payment of its debt to Iran to their release. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""an incredible moment"" for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family after an ""unimaginable ordeal"". He added that there would be questions to be answered about ""what happened along the way"", but at present his thoughts were with the family."
Ukraine war: Zelensky invokes 9/11 in plea to US Congress,2022-03-16T14:35:18.000Z,"Ukraine's president invoked the horror of the 2001 terror attacks on the US as he pleaded for more military aid in a historic address to the US Congress. Volodymyr Zelensky said via video link that Ukraine was enduring a 9/11 every day as it battled Russian forces. He again urged the US and Nato allies to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying: ""I need to protect the sky."" US President Joe Biden is later set to sign off an extra $800m (Â£612m) in military aid to Ukraine. Mr Zelensky urged the assembled US politicians to remember coming under attack in the past - at Pearl Harbor in 1941 and on 11 September 2001 - saying Ukrainians were experiencing the same thing every day. ""In your great history, you have pages that would allow you to understand the Ukrainian history. Understand us now,"" he said. He also referenced US civil rights leader Martin Luther King's famous speech: ""I have a dream, these words are known to each of you - today I can say I have a need. I need to protect the sky,"" he said. The Ukrainian leader also showed a video of missile strikes on his country's cities and the resulting dead and wounded people. What is Nato and how is it responding to the Ukraine crisis? Why a Ukraine no-fly zone is a no-go for the West He has repeatedly called on Nato to impose a no-fly zone over his country's airspace, but Nato has refused.  A no-fly zone over Ukraine would mean that Nato forces would have to engage directly with any Russian planes spotted in those skies and shoot at them if necessary. As an alternative to a no-fly zone, Mr Zelensky pleaded for air-defence systems and aircraft. He has previously asked the US and the EU for Polish MiG-29 fighter jets, but this has been rejected by Mr Biden over fears this would pull Nato members into the war.  Addressing President Biden directly in English, President Zelensky said: ""I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace."" Volodymyr Zelensky again demonstrated he had a firm grasp on how to plead his nation's case to a foreign audience in a language they could understand - both literally and figuratively. Speaking to the British Parliament last week, the Ukrainian president referenced Winston Churchill. In his video address to Congress on Wednesday, Zelensky compared his nation's daily aerial bombardment to Pearl Harbor and September 11. He also mentioned the carvings of US presidents at Mount Rushmore and Martin Luther King Jr's I Have a Dream speech - saying his nation had a ""need"" for more US assistance. The American public has been transfixed by video footage of the Russian onslaught, and Zelensky used sometimes graphic images of dead and injured children and bombed cities to drive home his request to ""close the skies"" to Russian attacks. Then the former actor made one final gesture of theatrical flair, ending his speech in English, framing the fight in Ukraine as a battle for the values of Europe and the world. When the stakes are framed this way, Zelensky may hope, it will be difficult for the US and its allies to say no. After the speech, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted that it had been a ""distinct privilege"" to hear from the Ukrainian president, and that the US was ""unwavering in our commitment to the people of Ukraine as they courageously defend democracy"". The $800m in funding set to be signed off later will go towards anti-armour and anti-aircraft weapons, such as Stingers and Javelins, US media report. The funding is covered by a spending bill on humanitarian, defensive and economic assistance to Ukraine that was approved by Congress last week.  In the past year, the Biden administration has provided $1.2bn in weapons for the country, including Mi-17 helicopters, patrol boats and small arms such as grenade launchers and machine guns, the New York Times reports.  On Wednesday, attacks by Russian forces continued in cities and towns across the country:  in the capital Kyiv, a 12-storey residential building was hit by shellingin Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, two people died when shelling hit a multi-storey apartment block, the emergency services said in Zaporizhzhia, officials say missiles struck a train station and a public parkabout 400 staff and patients remain trapped inside a hospital that has been captured by Russian forces in the besieged southern city of Mariupol. The International Committee of the Red Cross described the situation there as a ""waking nightmare"" Meanwhile, Nato defence ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss their response to the invasion.   Mr Biden is expected to travel to Brussels next week to meet Nato allies and participate in a summit of European Union leaders. The US president will ""discuss ongoing deterrence and defence efforts,"" and reaffirm his country's commitment to its Nato allies, White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said. On Tuesday, the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic met Mr Zelensky in the evening as a curfew began in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Afterwards, the Czech leader told Ukrainians that they were ""not alone"". The group are the first Western leaders to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded last month.

Wayne Couzens: Met PCs deny sharing offensive messages with killer,2022-03-16T13:38:47.000Z,"Two serving Met police constables and an ex-officer have denied sharing grossly offensive messages with Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens. PC Jonathon Cobban, 35, PC William Neville, 33, and former officer Joel Borders, 45, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court accused of the offences between April and August 2019. Couzens, 49, murdered Ms Everard last year while serving as a Met officer. All three defendants were released on bail and a trial was set for 28 July. PC Cobban, of Didcot, Oxfordshire, is charged with five counts of sending a grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing message on a public electronic communications network, while PC Neville, of Weybridge, Surrey, is charged with two counts of the same offence. Former Met officer Mr Borders, of Preston, Lancashire, also faces five counts of the same charge. The alleged offences took place two years before Couzens kidnapped Sarah Everard in a fake arrest in March 2021, before raping and murdering the 33-year-old marketing executive. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) previously said the charges arose from an investigation into the phone records of Couzens. In court, the three spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth and to enter not guilty pleas to each of the charges, during a hearing lasting about 20 minutes. The Met said the serving officers had been suspended from duty. "
Teddie Mitchell: Baby murderer's ex warned police he would kill,2022-03-16T06:03:32.000Z,"The former partner of a man who murdered a 12-week-old baby said she warned police ""if you do not stop him"" he would kill a woman or child. Kane Mitchell killed his then partner's son Teddie at the flat they shared in St Neots, Cambridgeshire in 2019. A previous partner of Mitchell's told the BBC she ""tried so hard to tell everybody what he was like, they just didn't take it seriously"". A child safeguarding practice review into Teddie's death is ongoing. In February 2021 Mitchell was jailed for a minimum of 18 years after being found guilty of murder, while the boy's mother Lucci Smith was sentenced for cruelty to a child. Mitchell, who was not Teddie's father but was raising him, assaulted the boy on 1 November 2019. Teddie died in hospital 10 days later and was found to have suffered 17 rib fractures, fractures to his right collarbone, a fatal skull fracture, and brain, spinal and eye injuries. The trial was told of numerous interactions between the family and the authorities, including after a fight between Smith and Mitchell in September 2019 when a social worker raised the issue of domestic violence with Smith while her partner was in the flat. A month before Teddie was born Smith received a letter from social services following an anonymous tip-off. Around this time a multi-agency safeguarding hub report was made, but social services in Cambridgeshire reviewed the case and felt no further action was required.  The killer's former partner Olivia (not her real name), has told the BBC she was abused by Mitchell and that the police came to the house ""26 or 27 times"". ""They had pictures, videos - my face was all bruised, my lips. I had bruises all over my cheeks, handprints round my throat and they had all that evidence and nothing was done, nothing,"" she said. She said on one occasion Mitchell tipped hot curry over her head after going ""ballistic"" when a bit of rice went over him during a food fight. Olivia said: ""I told the police if you do not stop him he's going end up killing me... or a woman or a child. I told the police that's what he'll do and I meant it. It's got now to a baby dying because they didn't listen. ""I tried so hard to tell everybody what he was like, they just didn't take it seriously - they didn't do enough, and now a poor baby has died, and I know in my heart I did everything I could."" She said that social services also told her Mitchell ""wasn't allowed around my children"". ""If he wasn't allowed around my children, then why would he be allowed around anyone else's children? If he was violent towards me, why wouldn't he be a risk to other women?,"" she said. ""I'm upset that a poor baby had to die for him [Mitchell] to be where he is. I'm upset that my children had to go through what they went through, their lives destroyed, for that to happen. They weren't listened to. I wasn't listened to."" The BBC understands the local child safeguarding practice review was originally due to be published in January - the same month a Channel 4 documentary on Teddie's murder was broadcast. However, the review has still not been made public and there remains no confirmed date for this. The Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Safeguarding Partnership Board said the report, written by an independent author, would be published ""imminently"". A spokesperson said the board ""felt it essential to allow sufficient time to gain accounts from relevant parties including family members"". A Cambridgeshire County Council spokesperson said it welcomed the review, adding: ""It is essential that lessons are learned.  ""Until the review is published it would not be appropriate for the council to comment on or anticipate the findings of the report.  ""We continue to improve our safeguarding best practice and all of us who have a role in protecting our children do so with absolute dedication to their safety and wellbeing. We will take on board any actions and recommendations made in the review."" Cambridgeshire Police said it had ""fully supported"" the ongoing review. The force added: ""We will, of course, take on board and action any learnings which come from the review. This forms a part of our continual review processes which strives to embed learning and best practice from local and national reviews. ""As the review has yet to be published, it is not appropriate for us to pre-empt the findings and recommendations."" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Lighter started Paisley fire that killed three children,2022-03-16T10:49:28.000Z,"A blaze that killed three children from the same family was started after a cigarette lighter set bedding on fire, investigators have ruled.  Fiona Gibson, 12, and her brothers Alexander, eight, and Philip, five, died at their Paisley flat in June, 2020. A fire service report into the accident said the source was a cigarette lighter that ignited bedding. The children's mother, Julie Daley, was injured in the fire but survived.  The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service incident report said that all three children died after being overcome by smoke.  Mother lays three children to rest after fatal fire in Paisley The report estimated that the fire had been going for between five and 30 minutes before being discovered. Five fire engines attended the incident, with the first arriving after five minutes. Police Scotland said at the time that they were not treating the fire as suspicious. The children's funeral in July, 2020 saw people line the streets as the procession passed through the Gallowhill area of Paisley. The cortege passed close to St Catherine's Primary School where the two younger boys were pupils. A JustGiving page set up by a family friend at the time of the accident raised tens of thousands of pounds for the children's mother Julie and their father Alex Gibson, who was out at the time of the fire.

Lancashire starlings form swirling whale-shaped murmuration,2022-03-16T07:12:37.000Z,"Thousands of starlings were captured in a ""breathtaking"" whale-shaped aerial display by an amateur photographer.  Birdwatcher David Cousins, 61, spotted the murmuration at the Leighton Moss nature reserve near the Lancashire village of Silverdale. Murmurations form when large numbers of starlings, which are now rare, fly together as they wake and before they roost during colder months. Wendy Bartlam, who also witnessed the spectacle, said it was ""gobsmacking"". Starling numbers have rapidly declined since the 1970s and they are currently on the red list of endangered birds. The birds often come together and ""perform aerial acrobatics"" to confuse predators and to keep warm in the colder weather, the RSPB said. Mr Cousins, who works in agriculture in Kendal, Cumbria, said he had followed the flock's movements across winter.  The birdwatcher said a peregrine falcon and marsh harriers had forced the group into a tight formation. ""Sunday night was a particularly large murmuration,"" he said. ""The flock flew into a swirling mass of liquid motion which caused it to have a sea mammal or fish shape."" Mr Cousins said he was ""delighted"" with the photographs he took on Sunday.

Russia's state TV hit by stream of resignations,2022-03-16T13:09:26.000Z,"When Marina Ovsyannikova burst into Russian living rooms on Monday's nightly news, denouncing the war in Ukraine and propaganda around it, her protest highlighted a quiet but steady stream of resignations from Russia's tightly controlled state-run TV. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has thanked her, appealing to anyone working for what he calls Russia's propaganda system to resign. Any journalist working in what he calls the fourth branch of power risks sanctions and an international tribunal for ""justifying war crimes"", he warns. Some of Russian President Vladimir Putin's biggest cheerleaders on state-run TV have already faced sanctions, including Vladimir Solovyov who presents a talk show on Russia's biggest channel Rossiya-1, and Margarita Simonyan who has accused anyone ashamed of being Russian at this point of not really being Russian. Russia's state-run channels are required to toe the Kremlin line, so who has quit in response to the war? Hours after Marina Ovsyannikova's on-screen protest, three resignations came to light.  Channel One colleague Zhanna Agalakova quit her job as Europe correspondent while two journalists have left rival NTV. Lilia Gildeyeva had worked for the channel as a presenter since 2006 and Vadim Glusker had been at NTV for almost 30 years. Rumours abound that journalists have also headed for the door at All-Russia state TV group VGTRK.  Journalist Roman Super said people were quitting its Vesti news stable en masse, although that has not been confirmed. However, renowned TV host Sergey Brilev quashed reports that he had resigned, pointing out he has been on a business trip for more than a week.  Maria Baronova is the highest-profile resignation at RT, formerly known as Russia Today. Former chief editor at RT, she told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg this month Mr Putin had already destroyed Russia's reputation and that the economy was dead too. A number of other RT journalists have also resigned, including non-Russian journalists working for its language services.  Former London correspondent Shadia Edwards-Dashti announced her resignation on the day Russia invaded Ukraine without giving a reason. Moscow-based journalist Jonny Tickle quit on the same day ""in light of recent events"". French RT presenter FrÃ©dÃ©ric TaddeÃ¯ said he was leaving his show because France was ""in open conflict"" with Russia and he could not continue to host his programme Forbidden to Forbid ""out of loyalty to my country"". Days later, the EU said it was banning all of RT's various outlets as well as those of fellow Kremlin outlet Sputnik for their ""campaign of disinformation, information manipulation and distortion of facts"". Russia's German-based state news agency Ruptly has also endured a spate of resignations, according to Reuters news agency. Russia's non-Kremlin media have come under repeated attack for years, so many journalists who have worked under constant threat of losing their livelihoods at independent outlets will be unimpressed by the current crop of resignations. Some have been hit with the Soviet-era label of foreign agent. Dozhd (TV Rain), which was forced off mainstream TV in 2014, has had to halt its online broadcasts because of the Ukraine invasion and a number of its journalists have fled Russia for their safety.  Radio Ekho Moskvy has also been taken off the air amid Russia's new legislation on so-called false information. BBC Russian is among a number of Western outlets that have been banned, while journalists working for Latvia-based Meduza were forced out of Russia. It is not just journalists who have disappeared from state TV. One of Russia's biggest talk show hosts, Ivan Urgant, has taken a break from his prime-time Evening Urgant show on Russia's second biggest channel, Channel One, the same station as Marina Ovsyannikova. He reacted to the war by posting a black square on his Instagram account with the simple message: ""Fear and pain. No War."" He has since told his followers not to panic, and that he's taken a holiday and will be back soon. Russia's number one celebrity couple Alla Pugacheva and Maxim Galkin are among a number of other showbiz figures who have also gone on holiday. Galkin said on Instagram: ""There can be no justification for war! No War!""

"Boris Johnson was warned of Lebedev security concerns, says Cummings",2022-03-16T17:55:57.000Z,"Dominic Cummings has said he was present when Boris Johnson was told of security concerns about his plan to award a peerage to Evgeny Lebedev. The ex-adviser said he was ""in the room"" when the PM was told intelligence officials had ""serious reservations"" about giving the honour to the Russian-born businessman. It follows reports the security services changed their advice after Mr Johnson intervened. The PM has previously denied this. Lord Lebedev, who owns the Evening Standard newspaper, has denied posing a ""security risk"" to the UK.  Gove: No-one raised Lebedev security concern with meIâm not a UK security risk, Russian-born peer saysWho are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Last week, the Sunday Times reported that in March 2020, the House of Lords Appointments Commission - which vets peerage appointments - advised Mr Johnson against granting Mr Lebedev a seat in the House of Lords on security grounds. The newspaper said the assessment was withdrawn after Mr Johnson - a long-time friend of Lord Lebedev - personally intervened. Another source has confirmed to the BBC that concerns were raised by security services.  Earlier, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner asked for guarantees that Mr Johnson had never asked anyone to urge the security services to ""revise, reconsider or withdraw"" their advice.  Standing in for Mr Johnson at PMQs whilst he visits Saudi Arabia, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said the ""suggestion"" she was making was ""sheer nonsense"". But, shortly after the exchange, Mr Cummings said it was false to call the claim nonsense, and Mr Raab had been ""given duff lines for the Commons by No 10"". On his personal blog, the PM's former senior adviser wrote: ""I was in the room when the PM was told by Cabinet Office officials that the intelligence services and other parts of the deep state had, let's say serious reservations, about the PM's plan"". ""I supported these concerns and said to the PM in his study explicitly that he should not go ahead,"" he added. Mr Cummings says Mr Johnson reacted by becoming ""very cross"", and said: ""This is just â¦ You're just â¦  ANTI-RUSSIAN"". Asked to respond to Mr Cummings's comments, a government spokesperson said: ""All individuals nominated for a peerage are done so in recognition of their contribution to society and all peerages are vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission."" Lord Lebedev, who also owns the Independent newspaper, was given a peerage in July 2020, for philanthropy and services to the media, after being nominated by Mr Johnson. Writing in the Evening Standard last week, he denied posing a ""security risk"" to the UK, saying: ""I am not some agent of Russia"" and that he was ""proud to be a British citizen and consider Britain my home"". The son of billionaire Russian banker and former KGB officer Alexander Lebedev, he moved to the UK as a child, and has condemned President's Putin's actions in Ukraine in his newspaper, writing: ""I plead with you to stop Russians killing their Ukrainian brothers and sisters."" Ms Rayner, who was standing in for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, pointed to newspaper reports that claimed British intelligence warned against granting a peerage to Lord Lebedev on 17 March 2020.  She then claimed that despite the concerns, the prime minister visited Mr Lebedev at his home in London 48 hours later, before the appointment was made in July. ""The central duty of any government is to keep the British people safe,"" she said.  ""There are now widespread reports that the prime minister did not accept warnings from our own intelligence services, granting a Russian oligarch - the son and business partner of a KGB spy - a seat here in this Parliament. ""It shouldn't matter if such a warning was about a close personal friend of the prime minister, it shouldn't matter if he gave the prime minister thousands of pounds of gifts, and it shouldn't matter how much champagne and caviar he serves."" Mr Raab said it was down to the House of Lords' Appointment Commission to vet any prospective peers after they are nominated by the PM. But he said peerages were given out ""in recognition of what [someone's] contribution is to society"", adding: ""I should say that includes those of Russian origin who contribute brilliantly to our nation, many of whom in this country are critics of the Putin regime."" Evgeny Lebedev is very well connected. He owns the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, is friends with the prime minister and made George Osborne editor of the Evening Standard after he left government.  Lord Lebedev was in the room when Boris Johnson and Michael Gove decided to back Brexit. Mr Johnson attended his party the day after winning a majority in the general election - and there are various reports of him attending other parties hosted by the Lebedev family.  Mr Lebedev has urged an end to the war in Ukraine. Those who know him say he is more likely to chat about his favourite authors, Leo Tolstoy or Fyodor Dostoevsky, than Russian politics. He has British citizenship, owns companies here and has a keen interest in the arts.  His father Alexander, however, is a former KGB spy. He made vast amounts of money after the fall of the Soviet Union. For some time, that has raised concerns among politicians in Westminster.  The decision to grant Lord Lebedev a peerage was hugely controversial. The prime minister has faced questions about whether he intervened to ensure it happened after concerns were reportedly raised by security services. There have been calls for the Intelligence and Security committee - which has access to classified material - to investigate. Labour has also urged the House of Lords Appointments Committee to publish details of the vetting process.  But Lord Lebedev himself used his Evening Standard newspaper to hit back last week. He said he was a proud British citizen, adding:  ""I am not a security risk to this country, which I love. My father a long time ago was a foreign intelligence agent of the KGB, but I am not some agent of Russia."""
Diesel rises again to hit a record Â£1.76 a litre,2022-03-16T14:20:52.000Z,"Diesel prices in the UK rose by an average of more than 2p in a day as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to affect global oil costs. The fuel jumped to a record Â£1.76 per litre on Tuesday, up from almost Â£1.74 on Monday. Petrol prices, which have also increased to record highs, rose to almost Â£1.65p a litre from about Â£1.64. The continuing price rises come amid warnings of potential global oil supply problems. Recent rises in the global price of oil has pushed up prices at the pumps in the UK, but there are hopes recent falls will transfer to cheaper fuel. Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC, said drivers could save almost 4p a litre by buying their fuel at one of the big four supermarkets, where the average for petrol is 161p and 171p for diesel. ""We continue to remain hopeful that retailers will soon start to pass on recent reductions in the price of wholesale fuel to drivers when they next buy supply. That ought to lead to petrol stabilising at around 160p while diesel ought to stay where it is based on current wholesale prices,"" he said. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), whose members include major supermarkets which sell fuel, has said retailers understand the cost pressures facing motorists.  Andrew Opie, of the BRC, said they would do everything they could to offer the best value-for-money across petrol forecourts. How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices? The International Energy Agency (IEA) said high commodity prices and sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine were ""threatening to create a global oil supply shock"". It estimated three million barrels per day of Russian oil could be taken out of the global market as a result of international sanctions.  The agency warned only Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have enough spare production capacity to offset the shortfall in Russian output, which it said was the largest oil exporter in the world. Russia continues to export oil for the time being due to deals and trades made before Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine, the IEA said. New business has all but dried up, however, because many Western countries are seeking alternative fuel supplies. Some countries, such as the US and Canada, have banned Russian oil imports, but by contrast, the EU, which is much more reliant on Russian energy, has stopped short of a ban. Meanwhile, the UK has said it will phase out imports of Russian oil in response to Russia's actions by the end of the year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has travelled to discuss energy security and other issues in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The IEA said the world was ""faced with what could turn into the biggest supply crisis in decades"", with global energy markets ""at a crossroads"". It added the ""implications of a potential loss of Russian oil exports to global markets"" could not be understated. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has brought energy security back to the forefront of political agendas as commodity prices surge to new heights. While it is still too early to know how events will unfold, the crisis may result in lasting changes to energy markets,"" it said. The price of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - hovered around $100 per barrel on Wednesday, having previously reached record highs of more than $130 a barrel in the immediate aftermath of Western countries hitting Russia with sanctions. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, but is affected by the global shifts in price which are driven by supply and demand forces. RAC fuel spokesman Mr Williams said UK fuel prices had increased at the fastest rate on record, with petrol rising 13p since the start of the month and diesel increasing by nearly 21p. He said a full tank of unleaded for a family car was now almost Â£91 on average. UK motoring groups have said fuel prices are likely to fall as global oil prices stabilise. Yet, there is a concern some retailers might be reluctant to lower their prices for fear of being caught out if wholesale costs jump back up again. ""The big question is how keen will retailers be to pass on those savings at the pumps as they will no doubt be extremely conscious of protecting themselves from any more rises that could suddenly materialise,"" said Mr Williams. ""Drivers badly need a break from these relentless daily rises."" The RAC has called on the chancellor to cut fuel duty or VAT in his upcoming Spring Statement."
Braemar Lodge Hotel evacuated after major fire and explosion,2022-03-16T14:50:24.000Z,"The occupants of a hotel have escaped without injury after a major fire and explosion in Aberdeenshire. Six fire engines were dispatched to the Braemar Lodge Hotel when emergency services were alerted just after 07:30. Police Scotland confirmed that seven guests, two staff and the owner were evacuated from the building to safety. A large explosion was captured on video, and flames could be seen in the hotel's upper floor and roof.  The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said they received an initial report of a shed being on fire at the property. It is thought a liquefied petroleum gas cylinder may have exploded in an external building before the fire spread to the main building. Dating from 1870, the hotel building is a former Victorian shooting lodge. The A93 Glenshee Road was closed near the hotel and local diversions were put in place. Braemar holidaymaker, Alan Walker, heard the blast from a nearby caravan park. He told BBC Scotland: ""We heard an explosion - it was very loud - and we wondered what it was, got dressed, and there's the smoke and the flames."" Aberdeenshire Council said lessons at nearby Braemar Primary School would be taking place online. The council hopes to reopen the school on Thursday. The SFRS said in a statement: ""We were alerted at 07:37 to reports of a shed on fire at Glenshee Road, Braemar. ""Operations control mobilised six fire appliances, one height vehicle and one water carrier to the scene where the fire is affecting a nearby commercial building. ""Firefighters are still at the scene and there are no reported casualties at this time."""

How is a UK debt to Iran connected to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?,2022-03-17T10:11:03.000Z,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a British-Iranian woman detained in Iran for nearly six years - is back in the UK. Her release - and that of another dual national, Anoosheh Ashoori - has been linked to the payment by the UK of a multi-million pound debt to Iran, over a failed arms deal dating back 40 years. 'Is that mummy?' - Nazanin home after six-year ordeal in IranWho is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? In the 1970s the Shah of Iran - the pro-Western monarch who then ruled the country - ordered 1,500 Chieftain tanks and 250 Armoured Recovery Vehicles from the UK in a deal worth an estimated Â£650m. The money was paid to International Military Services (IMS), a private company, then a subsidiary of the UK's Ministry of Defence. Only 185 of the tanks were delivered to the Iranian authorities before the Shah was deposed in the Islamic Revolution of 1979.  The Iranian government has been trying to regain the money for the undelivered tanks ever since. In 1990, Iran took IMS to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), a global business organisation which rules on trade disputes between countries. In 2001, a hearing found in favour of Iran. IMS appealed, although in 2002 it agreed to pay Â£328.5m to the court, in case its appeal was unsuccessful. The appeal hearings concluded in 2009 and the decision was upheld in favour of Iran.  However, the European Union had placed sanctions on Iran in June 2008, and IMS's payment was not released to the Iranians. The UK government admitted it owed Iran for the undelivered tanks, but said it could not make the payment while Iran was still subject to economic sanctions.  In addition, there was the complicating factor of how much the UK owed Iran.  The Â£328.5m security payment made by IMS in 2002 has attracted a considerable amount of interest since then. The UK disputed how much of this should be paid to Iran.  The British-Iranian was detained in April 2016, and spent nearly six years in detention for allegedly plotting against the Iranian government. She protested her innocence throughout this time. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe said she had been told by her captors that her imprisonment was connected to the fact that the UK had not paid its debt. In 2021, the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said Iran was linking her case and the unpaid debt.  He said: ""I think they [Iran] are trying to use this as leverage to settle the historic debt for the Chieftain tanks and that's what they want settled. We obviously reject any linkage because we don't want to encourage hostage diplomacy and we want to follow the legal processes.""  However, the UK government did not admit that her jailing, or the imprisonment of other dual nationals such as retired engineer Anoosheh Ashoori, were connected to the money.  ""These are two entirely separate issues,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in 2021. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori were released after months of talks between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and her Iranian counterpart.  Another dual national, Morad Tahbaz, has also been released from jail in Iran on furlough as part of the deal. Ms Truss has announced the UK settled the IMS debt ""in parallel"" to the prisoner release. She told MPs that ""highly complex"" negotiations led to the government finding a way to make a payment of Â£393.8m, and that the payment complied with existing sanctions, global counterterrorism financing rules and anti-money laundering regulations. Ms Truss said the terms would remain confidential, but added that Iran could only use the funds for humanitarian purposes."

Boris Johnson: Ukraine paying the price for West's failure over Putin,2022-03-16T20:14:09.000Z,"Ukraine is ""paying the price"" for the West's failure to understand the threat posed by Vladimir Putin, the PM says. Boris Johnson told the BBC the Russian president's invasion had ""already failed"" because he underestimated the ""strength of resistance"" in Ukraine. But he blamed European countries who ""went back to treating [Putin] as part of the community"" after his annexing of Crimea in 2014. Mr Johnson has been visiting Saudi Arabia, discussing energy security.  He said the West needed to ensure it was ""never again vulnerable to Putin's blackmail"" - especially when it came to relying on Russian oil and gas. But Labour criticised Mr Johnson for the visit, saying he was going ""cap in hand from one dictator to another"". PM: I raised human rights with Saudi ArabiaWill PM's trip find a way to plug the energy gap?What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? During his trip, Mr Johnson met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for an hour and 45 minutes for talks about ending reliance on Russian oil and gas. Afterwards, Downing Street said the UK and Saudi Arabia had ""agreed to collaborate to maintain stability in the energy market"" and boost renewable energy sources. A spokesman added the two countries had also agreed to boost co-operation in defence, security, trade and culture. However, a number of MPs had called on the PM to cancel the visit over the Saudi government's human rights record. Last week 81 men were executed in one day. The prime minister insisted that he did not ""turn a blind eye"" to the incidents and raised them with the country's officials.  But he said he had to be ""realistic"" and ""look at the global picture"" when it came to energy security. President Vladimir Putin ordered the annexation of Crimea - a territory of Ukraine - in 2014. He subsequently backed an eastern rebellion by pro-Russian separatists, who have fought Ukrainian forces in an eight-year war that has claimed 14,000 lives. Despite years of western sanctions, Russia remains firmly in control of Crimea, which it absorbed following a referendum vote discredited by much of the international community. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the PM said: ""If you look back at 2014 and what happened when Putin took part of Crimea... what we totally failed to understand [was] the threat that he posed and we renormalized.  ""European countries went back to treating him as though he was part of the community. ""Ukraine is paying the price for that now."" He also pointed to the strength of the resistance in Ukraine, adding that Mr Putin was committing war crimes in the country.  Mr Johnson said: ""He won't be able to crush and conquer Ukraine, because they've shown fundamentally that they have an indomitable spirit.  ""He's got to withdraw. He's got to close this thing down. He's got to take back his his tanks and his armour. And there's got to be as a solution that respects the will of the of Ukrainian people.""

And many countries - including the UK - pledged to phase out their use of the country's oil and gas to hit it even harder.   Mr Johnson said he planned to look to at solar, wind and to ""make some big bets"" on nuclear power going forward, but short-term solutions were also necessary.  ""The UK has a historic and a long-standing relationship with Saudi Arabia, which goes back many, many decades,"" said the PM.  ""That should not in any way stop us from raising issues of human rights."" He added: ""I want to be clear, we don't we don't just turn a blind eye, we don't wink at them, we don't ignore it, we raise it and we make the argument.  ""But what we also try to do is look at the global picture and look at the the impact on the world economy, and particularly the impact on the UK [as a] consumer of hydrocarbons. ""We're in a transitional phase now and we've got to be realistic about the continuing transitional importance of hydrocarbons in our in our economies."" "
Earthquake: Two dead after Japan hit by tremor,2022-03-17T11:35:55.000Z,"A powerful earthquake that hit north-east Japan left at least two people dead and 160 injured, officials said, but caused relatively minor damage. Two million homes initially lost power and a bullet train was derailed, but none of its passengers were hurt. The Japan Meteorological Agency lifted a tsunami warning on Thursday morning. The magnitude 7.4 quake was in the same area as the one which caused the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster but it was not damaged this time, officials said. In some areas the earthquake was too forceful for people to stand, and buildings rattled in the capital Tokyo.  The quake took place at 23:36 on Wednesday (14:36 GMT), at a depth of 57 kilometres (35.4 miles), Japanese authorities said. They warned of possible aftershocks in Fukushima, Miyagi and Yamagata prefectures.  Immediately after the event, Japan's meteorological agency issued an advisory for tsunami waves of one metre (3.3ft) for parts of the north-east coast, but it was withdrawn on Thursday morning after waves one-third of that height reached shore. A number of people across north-eastern Japan were hurt by falling objects or in falls, and in the city of Soma, Fukushima Prefecture, local media reported that one man in his sixties had died. A second death was reported in Miyagi Prefecture. Some media reports said four people died in the quake, but government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno said the number of fatalities directly caused by it was still being confirmed. Electricity to more than 2.2 million homes was temporarily cut in 14 prefectures, including the Tokyo region, but by mid-morning power had been restored to most places, the local electricity provider said. There was a lucky escape for those on board a bullet train that was derailed by the quake north of Fukushima city - fortunately it was not going fast and no-one was hurt.  Passengers and staff were trapped for four hours on board before being able to escape. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters earlier the government was still trying to assess the extent of any damage, and authorities said emergency services had been inundated with calls. Buildings in Tokyo shook for more than two minutes. Further north in Fukushima the shaking was much more powerful. In Ishinomaki in Miyagi Prefecture, a city official told AFP news agency he had been woken up by ""extremely violent shaking"". ""I heard the ground rumbling. Rather than feeling scared, I immediately remembered the Great East Japan earthquake,"" he said, referring to the 2011 disaster. Thursday's earthquake happened almost 60km off the coast of Fukushima, not far from the epicentre of the most powerful earthquake in Japan's history, which killed 18,000 people when it struck 11 years ago. The 2011 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed the Fukushima nuclear plant, sparking a major disaster after radiation leaked from the plant. Nuclear authorities said that no abnormalities had been detected after Wednesday night's earthquake at the damaged Fukushima site. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

Lloyd's of London fines insurer Atrium over initiation games,2022-03-16T15:26:52.000Z,"Lloyd's of London has fined a member firm Â£1m due to some male managers' heavy drinking, initiation games and sexual remarks about female staff. Atrium Underwriters admitted charges relating to bullying and misconduct during annual 'boys' nights out'. Some of the inappropriate behaviour was led, participated in and condoned by two senior leaders, Lloyd's found. Atrium said it accepted the ruling, was sorry for the hurt caused and would ensure it never happened again. The fine of Â£1,050,000 is the largest ever imposed by Lloyd's independent disciplinary committee and its first for non-financial misconduct. Atrium must also pay Lloyd's costs of Â£562,713, the committee's report said. The findings followed an investigation by Lloyd's enforcement team. In a notice of censure, Lloyd's said Atrium had sanctioned and tolerated an annual boys' night out over a number of years up until 2018. On these nights out some male members of staff, including two senior executives in leadership roles, engaged in unprofessional and inappropriate conduct, Lloyds found. This included initiation games, heavy drinking and making inappropriate and sexualised comments about female colleagues. These comments were found to be discriminatory and harassing to female members of staff. Behaviour by one male staff member - called Employee A in the document - ""included a systematic campaign of bullying against a junior employee over a number of years"", Lloyd's found. Once Atrium became aware of the bullying it failed to investigate, take disciplinary action or adequately protect the junior employee, it said. ""Instead, Atrium negotiated a settlement package with Employee A, and allowed him to resign from Atrium rather than face disciplinary sanction,"" it said. The document noted that Atrium had a previously good disciplinary record and had co-operated at all times with Lloyd's inquiry and enforcement proceedings. It added Atrium had now implemented changes including ""updating its policies and procedures relating to disciplinary issues, whistleblowing and diversity and inclusion, as well as its guidance and training for senior managers"".  Lloyd's chief executive, John Neal, said: ""We are deeply disappointed by the behaviour highlighted by this case, and I want to be clear that discrimination, harassment and bullying have no place at Lloyd's."" Christopher Stooke, independent non-executive chairman at Atrium, said the firm had failed to live up to its values and had made serious errors in handling what happened.  ""The behaviour outlined in the notice of censure has no place in our business or our industry, and we recognise that we must go further to ensure that this situation is never allowed to happen again,"" he said. In 2019, Lloyd's vowed to tackle its male dominated culture after almost one in ten workers said they had witnessed sexual harassment."
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Why has she been freed now?,2022-03-17T02:08:58.000Z,"It is almost six years since Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was first detained by the Iranian authorities in April 2016.  Since then there were repeated attempts to secure her release - all failed. So why has she now come home? The basic answer is London-Tehran relations are better than they have been.  The International Revolutionary Guard and Iran's judiciary no longer feel they need Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe for leverage in relations with the UK. Nazanin arrives in UK after being freed from Iran She was a diplomatic pawn held hostage by the Iranian authorities to put pressure on London.  If Tehran wanted to make nice, they would treat her well, give her access to medical help, perhaps increase the frequency of visits, possibly even allow her a temporary furlough from jail.  If Tehran wanted to exert pressure on London, then her conditions might worsen and privileges might be withdrawn.  The UK paying the historic Â£400m debt for tanks sold but not delivered will have made a huge difference.  For years, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) claimed the two issues were not connected. But in practice, the Iranians made them one and the same issue. Some in the FCDO had wanted to pay the debt but were prevented initially by reluctance within the Treasury and the United States, fearing it would reward hostage-taking and even fund terrorism.  Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe on way home to UKWho is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationalsHow is tank debt linked to Nazanin Zaghari- Ratcliffe? There were also fears the US would penalise any British financial institution that paid the money to the Iranian defence ministry in breach of international sanctions.  There is also the sheer relentlessness of the families' campaigning and the UK's diplomacy.  At first there were mistakes, such as Boris Johnson's false claim that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists in Iran, a claim that prompted Iran to level fresh charges.  But the tireless campaigning by Nazanin's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and others kept up the pressure on the UK government.  And that was reflected by the work of British diplomats behind the scenes, refusing to let Iran forget about the case.  There was almost a deal to release the detainees last year. It fell through. But since then British diplomats have visited Iran several times to try to reach a fresh agreement.  Iranian officials at their Ministry of Foreign Affairs were frequently frustrated that this dispute got in the way of the rest of the UK-Iran relationship.  But the Iranian diplomats were not in charge - the IRGC and the judges were.  Eventually, enough people with the Iranian government seemed to have realised that a permanently hostile relationship with the UK was not in Tehran's best interests.  That might apply directly to the talks taking place in Vienna, designed to revive the agreement under which Iran limited its nuclear activities in return for seeing economic sanctions lifted.  Iran's economy has been suffering, Iran clearly wants to agree a new deal, better relations with the UK might make that happen.  The deal has still not been agreed but diplomats say agreement is getting close.  And in recent weeks, during the Ukraine conflict, Britain and Iran's interests have also come closer together.  If sanctions can be lifted and Iran can start selling its oil again, that could help reduce global energy prices.  That is in the interests of both the UK and Iran. In that context, both sides might want to clear the diplomatic decks and make a deal more likely."
Anoosheh Ashoori: Iranian-Briton's family delighted at his release,2022-03-16T20:39:31.000Z,"The family of a British-Iranian man who is returning to the UK after being freed from Iran have said they are ""delighted"" by his release.  Anoosheh Ashoori, 67, a retired civil engineer, had been detained in Evin prison for almost five years. He and fellow British-Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe were released earlier on Wednesday.  Mr Ashoori's family said his freedom had been ""a long time coming"" and thanked all who helped bring him home.  In a video message posted on Twitter, his daughter, Elika Ashoori said: ""1,672 days ago our family's foundations were rocked when our father and husband was unjustly detained and taken away from us.  ""Now, we can look forward to rebuilding those same foundations with our cornerstone back in place."" She said this week had been an ""emotional rollercoaster"" and that it was not until her family was told his plane had left Iran that ""we allowed ourselves to feel joy for the very first time"". Elika spoke to her father when he was in Muscat and said he was ""excited"" - but noted it was ""very surreal"" to see him again, and that he had lost a lot of weight and that his hair had gone white while he was imprisoned.   He was looking forward to being able to ""finally sleep in a comfortable bed"" and ""to turn the lights off"" - as fluorescent lights are on all day and night at the prison.   ""All we're thinking about is him coming back tonight to his home and being with his family and surrounded by people who love him,"" she said.  Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationalsWhy has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe been freed now?How is a UK-Iran debt linked to Nazanin's release?  Mr Ashoori was arrested in August 2017 while visiting his elderly mother in Tehran, and was detained in Evin prison. Despite living in the UK for 20 years, he was later convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency and sentenced to prison for 10 years. His and Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release followed months of intensive diplomatic negotiations between London and Tehran and the repaying of a debt owed by the UK to Iran.  A third dual national, Morad Tahbaz, has been released from prison in Iran but will not be returning to the UK. The government has pledged to keep working to secure his return. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""We have the deepest admiration for the resolve, courage and determination Nazanin, Anoosheh and Morad, and their families, have shown. ""They have faced hardship that no family should ever experience and this is a moment of great relief."" Mr Ashoori's MP, Labour's Janet Daby, said it was a ""day of celebration"" for his family. The MP for Lewisham East told the Commons: ""As Anoosheh's member of Parliament I am, of course, thrilled beyond belief for his release and for Nazanin. I'm incredibly happy for Anoosheh's wife Sherry, for his children, as well as for their families and friends."" Ms Truss confirmed the UK government had settled the debt it owed to Iran from the 1970s ""in parallel"" with the release of the detainees. The UK paid Â£393.8m owed to Iran after it cancelled an order for British-made Chieftain tanks following the overthrow of the Shah in the revolution of 1979. Ms Truss said the debt had been paid ""in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations"". ""These funds will be ring-fenced solely for the purchase of humanitarian goods,"" she added. Mrs Zhagari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Racliffe, had long claimed that his wife was being used as a pawn in a dispute between the UK and Iran over the unpaid debt. Sanctions on the government in Tehran had been one of the key sticking points in being able to settle the debt. But Iran's Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said it was wrong to link the payment of the debt to the releases, adding: ""These two persons were released on humanitarian grounds.""  Ms Daby thanked Ms Truss for helping secure her constituent's release but said his detention could have been avoided. Asked why it had taken so long to secure the detainees' release, Ms Truss added: ""What I will say about the process of securing the release of our detainees is the foreign secretaries, the prime minister, Foreign Office officials, have worked tirelessly on this.""  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Oman's foreign minister Badr Albusaidi tweeted a picture of Mr Ashoori and Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe arriving in the Gulf state, which has been closely involved in negotiations to secure their release. He said: ""Soon they will be with their loved ones at home. We hope this result will bring further progress in the dialogue between the parties [the UK and Iran]."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is visiting Gulf states, welcomed news of their release. ""The UK has worked intensively to secure their release and I am delighted they will be reunited with their families and loved ones,"" he tweeted. According to Amnesty International UK, Mr Ashoori was ""subjected to torture, repeatedly interrogated without a lawyer present and forced to sign 'confessions' while sleep deprived"". In January 2020, Mr Ashoori's wife Sherry Izadi, who lives in London, said she feared he had no ""hope in hell"" of being released."
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Husband looks forward to 'new life',2022-03-16T18:41:59.000Z,"The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says he is looking forward to the ""beginning of a new life"" with her as she returns to the UK.  The British-Iranian woman had been held in Iran since 2016 accused of plotting to overthrow Iran's government - which she denied. Richard Ratcliffe said he was ""deeply grateful"" she had been released. He said he and their seven-year-old daughter Gabriella were looking forward to being a ""normal family"" again. ""We can't take back the time that's gone,"" he said. ""But we live in the future not the past. We'll take it one day at a time."" He said Gabriella had picked out which toys to take to show her mother when her plane lands - and he had promised one of the first things he would do was make her a cup of tea.  Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?Why has Nazanin been freed? BBC Sounds: Did tank debt cost Nazanin's freedom? Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been under house arrest since March 2020, when she was released from prison, and she was given her British passport back this week.  Mr Ratcliffe had campaigned tirelessly for his wife's release including staging a hunger strike outside the Foreign Office. Their enforced separation had been a ""cruel experience"" in many ways, he said, but had also been ""an exposure to such a level of kindness and care"" from people across the country.   He said his wife had remained ""pretty agitated"" in the run-up to her release and that things had been ""bumpy"" in her final days before she was freed.  Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 43, is on her way back to the UK along with fellow British-Iranian national Anoosheh Ashoori.  Mr Ashoori was arrested in 2017 and accused of spying, a claim he denied.  Morad Tahbaz, who has Iranian, UK and US nationality, has been released from prison but is not yet allowed to leave Iran.  The British government said it had settled a Â£400m debt owed to Iran from the 1970s which had been linked to the continued detention of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other UK-Iranian dual nationals held in the country.  But Iran's Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said it was wrong to link the payment of the debt to the releases, adding: ""These two persons were released on humanitarian grounds.""  Mr Ratcliffe said he had been ""kept out of the loop"" on discussions about the debt and the situation had been ""kept behind close doors"".    Speaking to reporters in London about his plans, he said: ""There will probably be a couple of days peace and quiet somewhere else, and then back here. ""The first thing she wanted was for me to make her a cup of tea, so we will do.  ""I think actually we were looking at the house and it needs a bit of tidying, so there might be a bit of tidying, perhaps directed by mummy when she comes back."" A photograph has now been released by MP Tulip Siddiq of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on a plane back to the UK, having flown via Oman. She is due to land on Wednesday evening. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Looking to the future, Mr Ratcliffe said it would be ""the beginning of a new life, a normal life"". ""Homecoming is a journey, not an arrival,"" Mr Ratcliffe said.  ""I don't think it will just be today, there will be a whole process, and hopefully we'll look back in years to come and just be a normal family and this will be a chapter in our lives, but there are many more chapters to come."" He asked his daughter ""do we still quite believe it?"" about her return - adding it was going to be ""lovely"" to finally see her again.  Mr Ratcliffe noted his wife had a ""big grin"" in a picture released of her leaving Iran. He said when she is back ""we can stop being a moment in history and start being a normal family again"". "

Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and why was she jailed in Iran?,2022-03-22T12:22:46.000Z,"Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt says it took too long to secure the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori from prison in Iran.  Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe spent six years in detention on spying charges which she has always denied. Mr Hunt told the BBC that the British-Iranian pair's return to the UK was an ""extraordinary achievement"", but one which should have happened sooner. Successive foreign secretaries - including the now-Prime Minister Boris Johnson - tried unsuccessfully to secure their freedom. The MP, who was foreign secretary between July 2018 and July 2019, said he did ""everything I could"", but accepts that ""it took too long"", and is now calling for an independent inquiry.  Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe rejected the credit given to current Foreign Secretary Liz Truss: ""I have seen five foreign secretaries change over the course of six years. How many foreign secretaries does it take for someone to come home?"" Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was criticised on social media, where commentators suggested she should be more grateful. However, Mr Hunt defended her on Twitter: ""Those criticising Nazanin have got it so wrong. She doesn't owe us gratitude: we owe her an explanation."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and fellow British-Iranian Anoosheh Ashoori arrived at RAF Brize Norton in the early hours of Thursday 17 March. They were freed after months of talks between Ms Truss and her Iranian counterpart. Another dual national prisoner, Morad Tahbaz, was briefly released on furlough, but returned to prison just two days later.  Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard, says she was told she was being held in order to force the UK into settling a multi-million pound dispute, which dates back to the 1970s. Iran claimed the UK owed Â£400m as a result of a cancelled order for 1,500 Chieftain tanks. Announcing Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, Ms Truss said this debt had been settled ""in parallel"", and ""in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations"". She said that negotiations had been taking place over the past few months with Iran, with the help of the Gulf state of Oman. Why has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe been freed now?How is a UK-Iran debt linked to Nazanin's release? 'Richard showed us what love really means' Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is 43, has dual British and Iranian citizenship. Before her arrest, she lived in London with her daughter and husband.  She worked as a project manager for the charity Thomson Reuters Foundation and was previously employed by BBC Media Action, an international development charity. When she was detained, she was visiting Iran with her daughter Gabriella.  Iranian authorities alleged Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was plotting to topple the government in Tehran, but no official charges were ever made public.  Iran's Revolutionary Guards said she was leading a ""foreign-linked hostile network"", and sentenced her to five years in prison.  She has always denied the accusations she faced, and insisted she had taken Gabriella, now six, to visit her parents and celebrate the Iranian new year.  Both the Thomson Reuters Foundation and BBC Media Action issued statements confirming that she was not working in Iran but was on holiday. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe spent the final year of her prison term on parole at her parents' home in Tehran.  But in April 2021, she was sentenced to a further year in prison and a one-year travel ban, after being found guilty of propaganda against the Iranian government. She subsequently lost an appeal against this second conviction.

Who are the dual nationals jailed in Iran?,2022-03-18T17:56:29.000Z,"The plight of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been released after being held on spying charges in Iran for almost six years, focused attention on Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency who are held in the Islamic Republic's prisons.  Iran does not recognise dual nationality, and there are no exact figures on the number of such detainees given the sensitive nature of the information. Some of the most prominent are:  The 66-year-old businessman and wildlife conservationist, who also holds American and British citizenship, was arrested during a crackdown on environmental activists in January 2018. His Canadian-Iranian colleague, Kavous Seyed-Emami, died in custody a few weeks later in unexplained circumstances.  The authorities accused Tahbaz and seven other conservationists of collecting classified information about Iran's strategic areas under the pretext of carrying out environmental and scientific projects. The conservationists - members of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation - had been using cameras to track endangered species including the Asiatic cheetah and Persian leopard, according to Amnesty International.  UN human rights experts said it was ""hard to fathom how working to preserve the Iranian flora and fauna can possibly be linked to conducting espionage against Iranian interests"", while a government committee concluded that there was no evidence to suggest they were spies. But in October 2018, Tahbaz and three of his fellow conservationists were charged with ""corruption on earth"" (later changed to ""co-operating with the hostile state of the US""), which carries the death penalty. Three others were charged with espionage, and a fourth was accused of acting against national security.  All eight denied the charges and Amnesty International said there was evidence that they had been subjected to torture in order to extract forced ""confessions"". In November 2019, they were sentenced to prison terms ranging from four to 10 years and ordered to return allegedly ""illicit income"".  Human Rights Watch denounced what it said was an unfair trial, during which the defendants were apparently unable to see the full dossier of evidence against them.  The Court of Appeals reportedly upheld Tahbaz's convictions in February 2020. UN human rights experts warned last year that Tahbaz's health condition had continuously deteriorated during his imprisonment. Despite that, they added, he had been denied access to proper treatment. In March 2022, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Tahbaz had been released from prison on furlough. The announcement came on the same day that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and fellow British national Anoosheh Ashoori were released by Iran and allowed to return to the UK. However, he was returned to prison just two days later. The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the Iranians had told them it was so that he could be fitted with an electronic ankle tag. Siamak Namazi, 50, worked as head of strategic planning at Dubai-based Crescent Petroleum. He was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in October 2015, while his father Baquer, 85, was arrested in February 2016 after Iranian officials granted him permission to visit his son in prison. That October, they were both sentenced to 10 years in prison by a Revolutionary Court for ""co-operating with a foreign enemy state"". An appeals court upheld their sentence in August 2017. Their lawyer said they denied the charges against them. He also complained that they had been held in solitary confinement and denied access to legal representation, and had suffered health problems. Siamak is also alleged to have been tortured. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said the Namazis' imprisonment violated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and demanded their release.  Baquer was given medical leave from prison in 2018 and placed under house arrest. However, his health has continued to deteriorate at home. In early 2020, Baquer was informed that the Revolutionary Court had commuted his sentence to time served and that the bail he had posted for his medical leave was released, according to his lawyer.  Despite the ruling, he was forced to stay in Iran because of an international travel ban, even after he had to undergo surgery to clear near-total arterial blockages in his brain in late 2021. Siamak remains in Evin prison, along with fellow US dual national Emad Shargi. The Iranian-American businessman and his wife moved to Iran from the US in 2017.  Shargi was initially detained by the Revolutionary Guards in April 2018, when he was working in sales for Sarava, an Iranian venture capital fund. He was released on bail that December, when officials told him that a court had cleared him of spying charges that he had denied. However, authorities refused to return his passport. In November 2020, Shargi was summoned by a Revolutionary Court and told that he had been convicted of espionage in absentia and sentenced to 10 years in prison, his family said. He was not imprisoned immediately and was released on bail ahead of an appeal. In January 2021, Iran's judiciary spokesman said an unnamed ""defendant"" facing spying charges had been arrested as he attempted to leave the country while on bail. It came a week after a state-backed news agency reported that Shargi had been detained while trying to cross Iran's western border illegally.  His daughters wrote in the Washington Post in April 2021 that he was ""trapped in terrible conditions"" in prison and that he had only been allowed a couple of short, monitored phone calls.  The 50-year-old specialist in emergency medicine was arrested in April 2016 while on a business trip from Sweden. Amnesty International said Djalali was held at Evin prison by intelligence ministry officials for seven months, three of them in solitary confinement, before he was given access to a lawyer.  He alleged that he was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment during that period, including threats to kill or otherwise harm his children, who live in Sweden, and his mother, who lives in Iran.  In October 2017, a Revolutionary Court in Tehran convicted Djalali of ""spreading corruption on earth"" and sentenced him to death. His lawyers said the court relied primarily on evidence obtained under duress and alleged that he was prosecuted solely because of his refusal to use his academic ties in European institutions to spy for Iran. 'My husband is facing execution in Iran' Two months later, Iranian state television also aired what it said was footage of Djalali confessing that he had spied on Iran's nuclear programme for Israel. It suggested he was responsible for identifying two Iranian nuclear scientists who were killed in bomb attacks in 2010. In November 2020, Iran dismissed an appeal by Sweden's foreign minister for it to not enforce the death sentence, after Djalali's wife said he had been informed by prison authorities that faced imminent execution. He spent five months in solitary confinement, awaiting execution, until April 2021, when he reportedly was transferred to a multi-occupancy cell. Djalali's family says he has been denied access to appropriate medical care for numerous health complications while in prison. Sweden gave him citizenship in 2018. He had previously been a permanent resident. The researcher at Sciences-Po university in Paris is a specialist in social anthropology and the political anthropology of post-revolutionary Iran, and has written a number of books. At the time of her arrest in Tehran in June 2019, she was examining the movement of Shia clerics between Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq, and had spent time in the holy city of Qom.  Adelkhah was accused of espionage and other security-related offences.  She protested her innocence and after going on hunger strike, she was admitted to hospital for treatment for severe kidney damage. Prosecutors dropped the espionage charge before her trial began at the Revolutionary Court in April 2020. The following month, the court sentenced Adelkhah to five years in prison for conspiring against national security and an additional year for propaganda against the establishment.    French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian condemned the sentence and demanded her release.  In October 2020, due to what Sciences-Po called her ""health circumstances"", Adelkhah was released on bail and allowed to return to her home in Tehran.  However, Iran's judiciary announced in January 2022 that it had returned Adelkhah to prison, accusing her of ""knowingly violating the limits of house arrest dozens of times"". French President Emmanuel Macron called the decision ""entirely arbitrary"" and said all of France was ""mobilised for her release"". The accountant was an adviser to the governor of Iran's central bank and was a member of the Iranian negotiating team for the country's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, in charge of financial issues. He was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in August 2016 just before he was due to board a flight to Canada, and was accused of ""selling the country's economic details to foreigners"". In May 2017, a Revolutionary Court in Tehran convicted Dorri Esfahani on espionage charges, including ""collaborating with the British secret service"", and sentenced him to five years in prison. That October an appeals court upheld Dorri Esfahani's sentence, despite Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi insisting that he was innocent.  The CEO of Austria-based IT management and consulting company Avanoc was detained during a business trip to Iran in January 2016.  That October, an Iranian prosecutor said Ghaderi had been sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of espionage and co-operating with a hostile state.  His wife insisted that he was a ""simple businessman"" who was unjustly imprisoned, while human rights groups said he was coerced into confessing to spying. His conviction was upheld on appeal and his request to the Supreme Court for a retrial has not been granted. Ghaderi's physical and mental health has deteriorated in Evin prison. In July 2019, UN human rights experts said he had been denied appropriate medical treatment, despite having a tumour in his leg.  His family and that of another Austrian dual national, Massud Mossaheb, have criticised the Austrian government's approach to their cases, particularly its failure to publicly request their release. ""After years of continuing to rely on 'silent diplomacy', we interpret this either as a sign of resignation, a lack of commitment or a lack of will to consider alternative strategies,"" they wrote in an open letter to the foreign ministry in April 2021. In January 2022, Ghaderi's wife told the Guardian that it was not clear what Iran wanted in return for his release. ""It may not be something directly from Austria, but from the EU,"" she said. The former businessman, who is an Austrian-Iranian dual national, was arrested in Tehran in January 2019. Amnesty International cited informed sources as saying Mossaheb was held in a hotel room for three days, where intelligence ministry agents subjected him to torture through sleep deprivation, interrogated him without a lawyer present, and coerced him into signing documents. He was then transferred to Evin prison, where according to the sources he was tortured. In April 2020, Mossaheb was sentenced to 22 years in prison after being convicted of ""espionage for Germany"", ""collaborating with a hostile government"" - a reference to Israel - and ""receiving illicit funds"" from both countries.  Amnesty International said the trial was ""grossly unfair"", with the court relying on relying on alleged ""confessions"" that he retracted in court and told the judge he had made under torture. In January 2021, a secret audio recording made by Mossaheb in Evin prison was released. In it, he pleaded to listeners to ""help me and rescue me from this hell"".  He also said he was suffering from several health issues, including diabetes, neuropathy and a faulty heart valve, and that he needed to have surgery to remove a kidney cyst. The retired architect, a German-Iranian dual national, was arrested at her apartment in Tehran in October 2020 and accused of ""endangering security"". She was placed in solitary confinement at Evin prison and not given access to lawyers, German diplomats or members of her family, according to her daughter Mariam Claren. Taghavi was repeatedly subjected to coercive questioning without the presence of lawyers, according to Amnesty International. Interrogators reportedly asked her about meeting people to discuss women's and labour rights, and possessing literature about those issues. In August 2021, she was convicted by a Revolutionary court in Tehran of ""forming a group composed of more than two people with the purpose of disrupting national security"" and ""spreading propaganda against the system"". She was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison.  Taghavi had denied the charges, the first of which was apparently related to a social media account about women's rights, and Amnesty said the trial was ""grossly unfair"".  Ms Claren wrote on Twitter that her mother ""did not commit any crime. Unless freedom of speech, freedom of thought are illegal"".  She has said her mother has been denied adequate healthcare by prison and prosecution authorities, despite doctors saying in September 2021 that she needed surgery on her spinal column.  The couple, who are Zoroastrians, own a well-known art gallery. They were arrested by the Revolutionary Guards at Tehran's international airport in July 2016. Two weeks later, the Tehran prosecutor announced that ""two Iranian dual nationals"" had been charged with hosting parties for foreign diplomats and Iranian associates during which men and women mixed and alcohol was served. Iran's constitution says adherents of Zoroastrianism - an ancient, pre-Islamic religion - are not subject to Islamic laws on alcohol and mixed gender gatherings. In early 2017, further charges were brought against Vafadari and his wife, including ""co-operation with enemies of the state"", ""activities to overthrow the regime"" and ""recruitment of spies through foreign embassies"". In January 2018, Vafadari wrote in a letter from Evin prison saying that a Revolutionary Court had sentenced him to 27 years in jail and his wife to 16 years, according to the US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI). He vigorously rejected all the charges they faced. The couple's sentences were later reduced to 15 years and 10 years respectively, their son said. In July 2018, the authorities reportedly released them on bail, pending an appeal."

Kherson: Russian-occupied city stays angry and defiant,2022-03-16T15:21:12.000Z,"More than a fortnight after falling under Russian occupation, the residents of Kherson are wrestling with acute shortages of medicine and holding daily protests against the Kremlin's forces. They are also worried that increased shelling on the outskirts might signal the start of a Ukrainian push to recapture their southern city, which is a key port. A series of loud explosions rattled the windows of Yuri Stelmashenko's office in a government building in the centre of Kherson on Tuesday afternoon, as the city's deputy mayor was on a phone call, busy explaining they had less than a week's supply of food and medicine left. ""Can you hear the shelling outside? Not far off. Unfortunately, we're having to get used to this terrifying reality,"" said Stelmashenko calmly. ""We're looking at a real humanitarian catastrophe here,"" he said. ""We've been left here alone - there's no other legitimate authority apart from the mayor. Russian officials came to our office and  we agreed that we would continue working. But it's not clear how long that will continue."" There have been reports that Russia might stage a referendum in Kherson on independence from Ukraine - as they previously did in Crimea after it was annexed in 2014, as well in the Russian-backed separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. But Stelmashenko rejected the idea of this happening in his city, saying it was clear there was no support for Moscow's actions among the largely Russian-speaking population.  Video footage showing a small pro-Russian demonstration in Kherson has been dismissed as a Kremlin propaganda stunt by locals. On the streets nearby, there were queues for milk, and frustration in local pharmacies which have reportedly run out of most essential drugs. ""There's no medicine left for people with heart conditions, or asthma. The hospitals are working but there's just no medicine,"" said a medic, speaking by telephone. She asked that we only use her first name, Galina. ""No-one is starving here,"" said a local university lecturer, Lada Danik, who praised the mayor's office for focusing on trying to support residents of the city without appearing to endorse the Russian occupation.  ""The situation is quite stable. We have electricity, water, and there is central heating and transport."" But Danik condemned officials in other occupied cities who have submitted to Russian rule. ""If they want to make our city Russian, then it's treason,"" she said.  In Melitopol, to the east, the Ukrainian mayor was reportedly abducted by Russian forces last week and has not been seen since.  A local pro-Russian official, Galina Danilchenko, has now claimed that she is Melitopol's new mayor and recorded a video message urging residents ""to adaptâ¦ to the new realities, so we can begin to live in a new way"". But in Kherson, thousands of residents, including Danik, have continued to take part in peaceful daily protests outside government offices in the city centre.  Video footage shows large crowds screaming ""fascistsâ¦ have you no shame?"" and ""go home"" at Russian troops. ""The quantity of soldiers is getting bigger. But they're not military now. They wear different, grey uniform. Like a kind of police,"" said Danik.  ""There were so many people at today's protests that the Russian troops started shooting into the air. It seemed to me they were afraid. I was crying to them: 'Go home, go to your mother.' Two of [the Russian soldiers] were laughing. I was really furious, so I just cried out some curse words.  ""I'm not an activist, but I want people to understand what's happening here. I'm in my homeland, not doing anything wrong. I'm trying to protect my daughter."" To the east, another key city, Mykolaiv, has so far managed to hold off a Russian advance.  Mykolaiv's governor, Vitaliy Kim, hinted that Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv were now looking to recapture Kherson, too. ""Fighting is taking place, clearing out several villages [of Russian forces]â¦The occupiers are fleeing, and people all say that the troops are running away. It's true. They run,"" he said in a post on social media. ""Kherson residents, we are with you. Wait! Together we'll be victorious.""

"Russia attacks theatre sheltering civilians, Ukraine says",2022-03-17T09:23:38.000Z,"Ukraine has accused Russian forces of bombing a theatre where civilians were sheltering in the besieged southern city of Mariupol. Deputy Mayor Sergei Orlov told the BBC that between 1,000 and 1,200 people had sought refuge in the building.  While the number of casualties is unclear, a local MP said the basement where people were gathered had withstood the bombing. ""It looks like most of them have survived,"" Dmytro Gurin told the BBC. But Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the city's mayor, earlier said emergency workers were struggling to reach the building due to constant shelling. Images of the theatre, verified by the BBC, showed extensive damage and smoke rising from the site. Russia's air strikes and shells have previously hit a maternity hospital, a church and apartment buildings. Mariupol's city council said in a statement that Russian forces ""deliberately and cynically destroyed"" the theatre, saying a ""plane dropped a bomb on a building where hundreds of peaceful Mariupol residents were hiding"". Both Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, and the city council accused Russia of a ""war crime"" in the wake of the attack. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the bombing and said Russia had deliberately targeted the theatre.  ""Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people. To our Mariupol,"" he said in a video address late on Wednesday evening. Satellite pictures taken on 14 March - released by the US company Maxar - showed the Russian word for ""children"" had been marked on the ground in large letters to warn Russian jets away from the building. The BBC was earlier told that many children and elderly people were sheltering inside, and that conditions were quickly deteriorating. Local authorities say at least 2,400 people have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the war, although they acknowledge this is likely to be an underestimate. Many of the dead are being buried in mass graves. An estimated 300,000 residents are trapped inside the city, where running water, electricity and gas have been cut off. Food and water supplies are running low, as Russian troops have not allowed the delivery of humanitarian aid. Hours after news of the destruction emerged, the Russian defence ministry denied it had carried out an air strike against the theatre, the RIA news agency reported. About 1,500 cars had managed to flee Mariupol on Wednesday, according to Mr Orlov, the deputy mayor. But, he said, an attack by Russia on the convoy left at least five wounded, including a child. Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, called for better access to civilians caught up in the war, which he said was causing ""enormous suffering"". Mr Maurer, who arrived in Ukraine for a five-day visit, described the situation in Mariupol as a ""waking nightmare"".   Elsewhere, at least 10 people waiting in a queue for bread in the northern city of Chernihiv were killed by Russian shelling on Wednesday, the country's prosecutor general said. Unverified footage released by a local outlet showed bodies on a street.

Ukraine conflict: Biden brands Putin a 'war criminal',2022-03-16T22:16:44.000Z,"US President Joe Biden has labelled Russian leader Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" in a move likely to escalate diplomatic tensions even further. Mr Biden delivered the remark off-the-cuff in response to a reporter's question at the White House. It is the first time he has used such language to condemn President Putin, and the White House later said he was ""speaking from his heart"". The Kremlin, however, said it was ""unforgiveable rhetoric"". ""We believe such rhetoric to be unacceptable and unforgivable on the part of the head of a state, whose bombs have killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency Tass. The exchange in Washington happened Wednesday when a reporter asked the US president: ""Mr President, after everything we have seen, are you ready to call Putin a war criminal?"" The President replied ""no"" before being challenged, and then changed his reply: ""Did you ask me whether I would tell ....? Oh, I think he is a war criminal."" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki later said the president had been speaking from his heart after seeing ""barbaric"" images of the violence in Ukraine, rather than making any official declaration. She noted that there was a separate legal process, run by the State Department, to determine war crimes - and that was ongoing separately. What is a war crime, and could Putin be prosecuted over Ukraine? The president's official Twitter account posted: ""Putin is inflicting appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine - bombing apartment buildings and maternity wards... these are atrocities. It is an outrage to the world."" One by one, diplomatic bridges between the United States and Russia are being set ablaze. Mr Biden's statement was an odd one, albeit not out of keeping for a politician who has a history of making monumental policy shifts in seemingly off-the-cuff remarks (see, for instance, his comments on gay marriage in 2012).  After initially telling a reporter he did not think Mr Putin was a criminal, he came back and reversed himself. If there had been an internal debate at the White House over how to handle the growing calls in Congress and the press to condemn Mr Putin in this way, the president settled it in an aside, not a set-piece speech. This, of course, will make it harder for Mr Biden and his administration to work with the Russians going forward. Every concession or negotiated agreement, on whatever topic, will invite the rejoinder: How can you associate with a criminal? Perhaps Mr Biden, in his comments, was simply acknowledging the new reality - that the world's political order has irrevocably shifted, and there's no going back to the way things were. It came after a busy day of political theatre in both the US and Russia over Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier gave a speech by video link to the US Congress, receiving a standing ovation. Hours later, Mr Biden approved additional weapons aid for Ukraine, bringing the total US contribution to $1bn (Â£760m). On the other side of the world, President Putin also gave a televised speech laden with anti-Western rhetoric. He accused the West of trying to divide Russia with lies, and railed against those he called ""traitors"" inside of Russia. ""Of course they will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on traitors - on those who earn their money here, but live over there. Live, not in the geographical sense, but in the sense of their thoughts, their slavish thinking,"" Mr Putin said.  The term ""fifth column"" is often used for a group that tries to undermine a nation or organisation from the inside. ""Any people, and especially the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just to spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into their mouths,"" Mr Putin said. Such a ""self-purification"" of society would strengthen Russia, he added. Mr Putin also accused the West of trying to provoke civil conflict with the goal of ""the destruction of Russia"". His speech was greeted with concern by some Russia-watchers and journalists. Tatiana Stanovaya, a political analyst, told the New York Times that Mr Putin was signalling authorities across Russia to target ""all spheres of society that show any sympathy to the Western way of life"". Mikhail Kasyanov, a former Russian Prime Minister who also worked in Mr Putin's first government before becoming one of his fiercest critics, tweeted that Mr Putin ""is intensifying his actions to destroy Russia"". He is ""essentially announcing the start of mass repressions against those who don't agree with the regime,"" Mr Kasyanov wrote. ""This has happened in our history before, and not only ours.""

War in Ukraine: Fourth Russian general killed - Zelensky,2022-03-16T21:00:37.000Z,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says another Russian general has been killed during fighting.  He didn't name the officer, but an adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry said Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev had been killed by the far-right Azov regiment. Gen Mityaev was killed near Mariupol, Ukrainian media said. He is the fourth general reportedly killed, leading some to ask why such senior members of the Russian military are so close to the front line.  Analysts believe that around 20 generals are leading Russian operations in Ukraine, meaning that if all the reported deaths are confirmed, one fifth of Russia's generals have been killed in action.  With such high losses, some experts believe that the generals have not simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but that Ukraine is likely to be targeting top-level Russian officers.  ""I don't think this is an accident. One is an accident, but this many is targeted"", Rita Konaev of Georgetown University told the BBC.  Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, a person within President Zelensky's inner circle said Ukraine had a military intelligence team dedicated to targeting Russia's officer class.  ""They look for high profile generals, pilots, artillery commanders,"" the person told the newspaper. With Ukraine's military outnumbered, its targeting of high-level individuals could be an important part of the information war, according to Ms Konaev.  ""Assuming there is an element of targeting, this feeds Ukraine's own morale. There is the element of being victorious. It is inspiring."" LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyWATCH: Kyiv residents record life under siegeANALYSIS: Putin will search for a way to save faceBUSINESS: The Western brands unable to leave RussiaIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict For Ukraine to target specific Russian officers, it needs to know where they are. Analysts say that Russia has been using open channels of communications which could give clues about where certain targets are located.  ""If the Russians are using mobile phones or analogue radios to communicate with senior officers, the Ukrainians have everything on their plate,"" defence analyst Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting told the BBC.  After the death of another senior officer - Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov - Ukraine released a recording purporting to be two Russian security officers discussing the general's death, and complaining that their secure communications network was not working.  It is unusual for such high-ranking officers to put themselves in danger by getting so close to the battlefield, and western sources believe that they have done so in order to get some control over operations which have, in some areas, badly stalled.  Russia's military is also traditionally top-heavy, with officers often conducting day-to-day activities, says Mr Muzyka. Although this is starting to change, it could explain why generals felt the need to direct operations from the front.  ""In recent years there's been a big shift to force battalion commanders to think independently in a way that would give them freedom to make decisions"", Mr Muzyka said. ""But this was introduced only three years ago, so maybe it didn't properly have an effect yet on their performance"".  The details of the generals' deaths are unclear, and getting solid facts from the ground is difficult. There has been an assumption that they were all caught up in fighting on the front line, but that is not necessarily the case, says Ms Konaev.  ""It doesn't necessarily mean the generals were at the front line. They could have been in transit or inspecting resupply lines for example,"" she told the BBC.  Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev reportedly died somewhere near the city of Mariupol, a city in south-east Ukraine which has seen some of the heaviest fighting so far.  The far-right Azov regiment claims to have killed him.  He was a commander of the Russian army's 150th motorised rifle division, a relatively new unit formed in 2016, and based in the Rostov region close to the Ukrainian border.  Ukraine claims that the unit was created in order to take part in the conflict in separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine, although Russia denies that its military was involved in fighting there.  Maj Gen Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th combined army, was killed in fighting on March 11, according to official Ukrainian sources.  The circumstances of his death were not given.  After Kolesnikov became the third Russian general reportedly killed in Ukraine, one western official told the Press Association that the Russian army may be suffering from low morale, which is why high-ranking military officers are moving closer to the front line.  Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of Russia's 41st combined army, was killed on 7 March outside the eastern city of Kharkiv, according to Ukraine's defence ministry.  Kharkiv, close to the Russian border, has come under sustained attack from Russian forces.  Ukraine's military released a recording of what it said was two Russian security service officials discussing Gerasimov's death, and complaining that their secure communication networks no longer worked in Ukraine.  Gerasimov was involved in the second Chechen war, the Russian military operation in Syria, and in the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.  Maj Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky, a deputy commander at the same unit as Gerasimov, was reportedly killed by a sniper on 3 March. Like Gerasimov, Sukhovetsky was part of Russia's military operations in Crimea and in Syria.  Unlike the other generals, Sukhovetsky's death was reported in the Russian media and Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed in a speech that a general had died in Ukraine. "

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori back with families,2022-03-17T18:14:40.000Z,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori have been reunited with their families in the UK after years of detention in Iran. The British-Iranian nationals were met by their loved ones at RAF Brize Norton in the early hours of Thursday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's seven-year-old daughter Gabriella rushed to hug her mother, who she had not seen in years. Mr Ashoori's daughter Elika spoke of her happiness at seeing her father, sharing a video of the pair's arrival. Gabriella was heard asking ""is that mummy?"" before her mother walked down the plane's stairs at the airport in Oxfordshire.  Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 43, and Mr Ashoori, 67, finally left Tehran on Wednesday after their release was secured following months of negotiations. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the pair's departure from Iran had been uncertain until the last minute, but they were in good spirits. MP Tulip Siddiq said Gabriella had asked her if her father Richard was ""pulling her leg"" about her mother coming home.  ""My heart just broke,"" she said, adding that when she told her she was, Gabriella started playing the piano and singing. Richard Ratcliffe's sister Rebecca said ""a little girl has finally got her mummy and daddy back"" alongside a picture of the family. She told the BBC the two families had gone to a safe house and ""Gabriella slept in between Richard and Nazanin for the first time in six years, so a very special moment"". She said she had had a message from her brother on Thursday morning and described him as ""very buoyant"". He had said it was ""lovely to be with his family again"", she added. It marked the end of an ordeal that saw Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe detained for six years after being accused in 2016 of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government. She was sentenced to a further year in prison in April last year and a one-year travel ban on charges of propaganda against the government. Mr Ashoori, a retired civil engineer, was detained in 2017 on spying charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Both have consistently and vigorously denied the allegations. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter How is a UK-Iran debt linked to Nazanin's release?  Their release came after the UK settled a debt to Iran of almost Â£400m dating from the 1970s, when Iran ordered British tanks and armoured vehicles. After the Iranian revolution in 1979, the UK cancelled the order and Iran demanded its money back for undelivered vehicles. On Wednesday, Ms Truss called this debt ""legitimate"" - adding that it and the detainees were ""parallel issues in our bilateral relationship [with Iran]"". She said the money would be paid in compliance with sanctions on Iran, and ring-fenced for humanitarian purposes. The prime minister's spokesman insisted the payment was ""not contingent on the release of any detainees"" and said the government had ""never accepted our nationals being used as political leverage, including to try and secure the IMS debt repayment"". Why has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe been freed now?Iranian-Briton's family delighted at his releaseWho is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?Did tank debt cost Nazanin's freedom? A third detainee, Morad Tahbaz, who has Iranian, UK and US nationality, remains in Iran although he has been released from prison. Ministers have vowed to continue to push for his return home. The 66-year-old businessman and wildlife conservationist was accused of collecting classified information about Iran's strategic areas under the pretext of carrying out environmental and scientific projects, which he denies. Ms Truss said she was pleased he had been released, but said the situation was ""far from sufficient"".  The government would continue to work for his departure from Iran, she added. Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Breakfast the Iranians considered his case more complicated because of his US citizenship - but said the British government did not and would continue to work alongside the US to secure his full release. Speaking before Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's return to the UK, Mr Ratcliffe said he was ""deeply grateful"" for his wife's release and that it would be the ""beginning of a new life"" for their family. He said Gabriella had picked out which toys to show her mother when the plane landed, and that one of the first things he would do was make his wife a cup of tea. His parents Barbara and John Ratcliffe said they believed the family would be spending a few days in Foreign Office accommodation before returning home, but said they hoped to see them at the weekend. Mr Ratcliffe had said he was worried about how untidy the flat was ahead of his wife's return and his father described it as ""appalling"". His mother told BBC Breakfast there was a lot of campaign material as well as lots of toys which people had given to Gabriella. ""Maybe we should all be up there at the moment tidying,"" she said. Ms Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said there was going to be a period of adjustment for the family. ""They are going to be different people... they have to get to know each other and Gabriella has to be able to trust her mother again,"" she said."
Ukraine war: Russians grieve for fallen soldiers,2022-03-17T01:08:07.000Z,"In the Church of Alexandra and Antonina lies a coffin. It is draped with a Russian tricolour. Resting on the casket: a service cap and a photograph. Mikhail Orchikov was deputy commander of a motor-rifle brigade. He was killed in action in Ukraine. Armed Russian soldiers form a guard of honour. An Orthodox priest walks around the casket reciting prayers and swinging an ornate metal vessel emitting burning incense. The pungent scent fills the chapel, mixing with the sweet cadences of the church choir. The dead soldier's widow, head covered in a black scarf, is being comforted by relatives.  How many Russian servicemen have been killed in Ukraine? It is a criminal offence in Russia to report anything other than the official figures.  According to information released by Russia's Defence Ministry, 498 soldiers have lost their lives in what the Kremlin calls its ""special military operation"". Those are the latest figures, from 2 March. There has been no update for two weeks. ""The situation in our country isn't simple,"" the priest tells the congregation. ""Everyone understands that."" The Kremlin wants the public to believe that the Russian soldiers in Ukraine are heroes and that Russia's offensive there is an act of self-defence. In a recent edition of state TV's flagship weekly news show, the anchor claimed that if Russia ""hadn't intervened now, in three years' time Ukraine would have been in Natoâ¦ with a nuclear bomb. [Ukraine] would definitely advance on Crimea, then on southern Russia."" An alternative reality, in which Ukraine is the aggressor. On the streets of Kostroma, many appear to believe the official Kremlin line.  That's partly due to the power of television in shaping public opinion. But also, at moments of crisis, many Russians instinctively rally around its leader - as if they don't want to believe that their president may have made the wrong decision.  ""Nato wants to set up shop right next to us [in Ukraine] and they've got nuclear weapons,"" Nikolai tells me. ""Well done Putin. He didn't let them."" ""Russia needs to push on till the end,"" declares pensioner Nina Ivanovna. ""How much do you trust the information you're getting on Russian TV about this?"" I ask her. ""I trust it. Why shouldn't I? It's the internet I don't trust."" ""Why not?"" I ask. ""I don't know,"" she replies.  Not everyone supports Russia's offensive in Ukraine. In the village of Nikolskoye, I visit the home of Orthodox priest, Father Ioann Burdin. He recently delivered an anti-war sermon and voiced his criticism on the church website.  He was later detained and fined under a new law for discrediting the Russian Armed Forces.  ""I believe that any bloodshed, whatever the cause and however you try to justify it, is still a sin,"" Father Ioann tells me. ""Blood is on the hands of the person who spilled it. If an order was given, it's on the hands of whoever gave the order, supported it or stayed silent."" ""The worst thing of all is that hatred has appeared. It will grow deeper and deeper, because we can see that the situation [with Ukraine] isn't ending. There is no political will to stop this. Hatred on both sides will strengthen and become a wall between our peoples for decades to come."" At a cemetery in Kostroma, eight soldiers bear Mikhail's coffin to the grave. A military band plays solemn music. Then a gun salute and, to the Russian national anthem, the casket is lowered into the ground. There is a brief speech: ""The loss of a son, brother, father is always a tragedy, but we are proud that he died defending our people, our children, our country."" In Kostroma, they call Mikhail ""a defender of the Fatherland"". And yet it was Russia's army that crossed the border into a sovereign nation and attacked Ukraine on the orders of President Putin. The Kremlin leader claims that the aim of his ""special military operation"" is to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine, as if the Ukrainian government is overrun with fascists - which is simply not true.  In recent days Russian officials have barely concealed their wider objectives. The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that what's happening in Ukraine ""â¦is a life-and-death battle for Russia's right to be on the political map of the world with full respect for their legitimate interests"". In other words, this is about geopolitics, and Moscow's determination to force Ukraine back into Russia's sphere of influence. That's something the government in Ukraine is determined to prevent.

Sophie Lancaster murder: Killer Ryan Herbert to be freed from jail,2022-03-16T18:51:15.000Z,"A murderer who kicked a 20-year-old woman to death because she was dressed as a Goth is to be freed from prison. Ryan Herbert was aged 16 when he was jailed for life in 2008 for murdering Sophie Lancaster in a park in Bacup, Lancashire. The Parole Board has decided Herbert can now be released on licence. Reacting to the decision, Sophie's mother, Sylvia Lancaster, said: ""Once again we have a justice system that fails to deliver justice."" She said the original sentence reflected the ""level of violence"" her daughter was subjected to during a ""feral"" attack. Herbert, whose minimum term was cut in 2020, and a friend battered Sophie as she cradled her boyfriend's head, who they had also attacked. She died 13 days after being beaten by Herbert and Brendan Harris as she tried to protect Robert Maltby from attack in Stubbylee Park. Herbert, of Bacup, admitted both murder and assault causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was given a minimum term of 16 years and three months, which was later reduced to 15 and a half years. He had his minimum tariff reduced to 14 and a half years in February 2020, making him now eligible for parole consideration two years later. High Court judge Mr Justice William Davis concluded the tariff could be reduced as he had made ""exceptional progress"" in prison. Ms Lancaster said she could not understand the decision being made ""because they have done well in prison"" when the Parole Board knew ""the reality of the level of violence"" Sophie had been subjected to. ""However much progress people make in prison, they have been given their sentence in recognition of the extent of their crime,"" she said. Ms Lancaster said her daughter's injuries were ""so severe"" paramedics could not ""facially distinguish if she were male or female"". The judge described the attack as ""feral"" and her attackers as ""savage and merciless"", she added. The Parole Board's ruling found Herbert had made ""significant changes to his life which reflected his remorse, his insight and increased maturity"". ""After considering the circumstances of his offending and examining the evidence for the progress made while in custody, the panel was satisfied that Mr Herbert was suitable for release,"" a document setting out the decision said. The document said Herbert's behaviour had ""initially been poor"" but this changed once he moved into an adult prison and he had taken part in rehabilitation programmes. After being moved into an open prison in November 2020, he ""improved his education with studies to degree level"" and had ""fully engaged with resettlement activities"" including spending time on temporary release from jail, it added. ""No concerns about compliance had been identified and Mr Herbert had good working relationships with professional staff,"" it said. Witnesses, including his probation officer, recommended he be released on licence.  Herbert will be subject to restrictions on his movements, where he lives and who he contacts. Harris, who was found guilty of Sophie's murder in 2008 and admitted the attack on Mr Maltby, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years.

Preston man detained for Army veteran's one-punch death,2022-03-16T19:30:05.000Z,"A man who caused the death of an 86-year-old Army veteran with a single punch has been detained. Frank Fishwick was attacked after he confronted a group of youths who had congregated outside his flat in Fulwood, Preston, on 10 September. He initially refused an ambulance but died in hospital the next day as a result of internal bleeding. Mohammed Al Aaraj, 19, was sentenced at Preston Crown Court to four years in a young offenders institution. Mr Fishwick, a former Royal Engineer, was at home in The Paddock when he was disturbed by a group of young people at about 15:00 BST.  Francis McEntee, prosecuting, said Mr Fishwick, who he called a ""feisty older man"", confronted the group, first through his window and then by going out to them. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the veteran became frustrated with the situation and directed racially offensive language at one of the teenagers.  Syrian refugee Al Aaraj, of Sheffield Drive in Preston, then punched Mr Fishwick in the face and fractured his nose. In police body-worn camera footage shown to the court, Mr Fishwick was seen in his flat, holding his bloody nose and telling an officer he asked the group to move but they had refused. Mr Fishwick told police officers he did not want medical attention but his nose continued to bleed and he was admitted to hospital later that day.    A post-mortem examination found the cause of his death was internal bleeding. Sentencing Al Aaraj, Judge Robert Altham said: ""The comments made by Mr Fishwick do form part of the background in this case, however even the making of those comments cannot begin to excuse the defendant, a young man, punching an 86-year-old man in the face."" Al Aaraj was charged with manslaughter, which he initially denied. The CPS said he changed his plea to guilty after officers produced CCTV evidence and Mr Fishwick's account from a police officer. Senior Crown Prosecutor Paul Robinson described it as an ""extremely tragic case"".  ""Frank was frustrated and used inappropriate language that cannot be condoned, but Al Aaraj and his friends could have simply walked away, and they chose not to,"" he said.  Mr Robinson said his death had been ""devastating"" for his daughter, who had not seen her father for a long time due to the pandemic.  In a statement, Mr Fishwick's daughter, Judith Taylor Fishwick, who lives in America, said her relatives' lives were ""turned upside down"" by the attack.

Police powers reviewed under racial disparity plan,2022-03-17T10:18:31.000Z,"The government has set out its long-term vision to address racial disparities in the UK with changes to policing, health and education.  More than 70 measures are part of the new ""Inclusive Britain"" action plan. It includes greater scrutiny over the way police use stop and search powers and improvements to how ethnicity data is collected.  Inclusive Britain has been developed in response to the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. That led to the establishment of a Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, which made a series of recommendations for reform, grouped under three key themes: building trust, promoting fairness, and creating agency. 'UK not deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities'The black British history you may not know about The new measures include: A new, national framework for police powers, such as stop and search, with greater scrutiny at a local level An automatic ""opt-in"" pilot to help ethnic minorities and others receive legal advice when in police custody A new Office for Health Improvement and Disparities to improve health for everyone A diverse panel of historians to develop a new knowledge-rich Model History Curriculum by 2024, exploring Britain's historical past Guidance to employers on how to measure and address the ethnicity pay gap Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch MP said: ""This is at the heart of our levelling up agenda. It's broader and more wide-ranging than any other review we've had into race and ethnicity in this country. ""The causes behind racial disparities are complex and often misunderstood.  ""Our new strategy is about action, not rhetoric and will help create a country where a person's race, social or ethnic background is no barrier to achieving their ambitions."" However, Taiwo Owatemi MP, Labour's Shadow Equalities Minister, said the report failed to deliver meaningful action, and let down ethnic minority communities. ""The next Labour government will introduce a landmark Race Equality Act to tackle racial inequality at its source and deliver security, prosperity and respect to everyone regardless of their background."" The announcement builds on the Levelling Up White Paper published last month which aims to spread opportunity more equally across the country. Inclusive Britain was officially presented to business leaders, charities and public figures in Birmingham. Somia Bibi from Himaya Haven, a support group in Birmingham which helps families of loved ones in custody and prison, said racism is still a problem in some parts of the UK. ""Institutional racism comes in many forms, especially in the criminal justice system,"" she said.  ""We find our family members are disproportionately from south Asian and black communities and if you look at the make-up of the prison system race is a factor."" But Naseam Kaid, a Streetwatch co-ordinator in Birmingham, believes good progress is being made. ""You see a lot of Asian and black officers around now, especially in my neighbourhood,"" he said.  ""There's more diversity and better training in police work now."" Last year's independent commission was heavily criticised for playing down the impact of racism and systematic barriers facing ethnic minority communities. And Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, says the proposed changes don't go far enough.  ""We welcome any measures which will begin to address racial and socio-economic disparities,"" she said. ""But we must not forget how much black and ethnic minority communities have suffered in the last two years as a result of Covid-19. ""We don't want to see the government giving with one hand to ethnic minority communities and taking away with the other, but instead action from the whole of government is needed to address racial disparities in our society."" Tru Powell, Director of the Aston Performing Arts Academy, says he's lost confidence in the government after a lifetime of personal and professional experiences of racism in the UK. ""I experienced racism in school and have been stopped and searched multiple times by police. ""These new measures seem like more empty promises. I feel like things are getting worse and we are regressing."" ""I would like to think we're seeing change but I don't think it will happen in my lifetime."" His company recently decided to no longer perform at corporate events unless black people were in the audience to increase representation and inclusion in the arts. ""We've been performing for over 15 years across the Midlands but we've found that the diversity of those coming to see us is lacking.  The events we do celebrate the great and good in Birmingham but when there's a lack of representation in your room, it suggests black people aren't contributing to the city and we have a problem with that."""
Ros Atkins On... Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and the Iran debt,2022-03-16T23:09:25.000Z,
"Newspaper headlines: Nazanin free and Russia 'hits theatre holding 1,200'",2022-03-17T00:13:20.000Z,"The long-awaited release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after six years in detention in Iran leads many of today's papers. The Guardian's front page shows a smiling Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe on a plane after taking off from Oman as part of her return to the UK. The paper also reports on an alleged Russian airstrike on a theatre in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol in which hundreds of people are thought to have been sheltering. The same photo takes up the whole of the front page of the Express, which says Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release has brought ""hope to a troubled world"". The Telegraph says that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has finally been able to tell their seven-year-old daughter Gabriella that ""mummy really is coming home"". It also reports on the shelling of the Mariupol theatre, saying the incident is among many now expected to be examined by the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox A similar headline in the Mail reads: ""Mummy's home at last!"" The paper quotes Mr Ratcliffe saying the fight to get his wife home was a ""long process"" - but reports that Gabriella is now excited to have her mother take her to school and meet her friends. The Times quotes Mr Ratcliffe as saying his wife will spend her first day back at home ""learning to be happy again"" and that the family were looking forward to the ""beginning of a new life"". The paper reports that her release came after a total of Â£393.8m was paid to Iran to settle a decades-old debt. The page also carries a quote from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in which he says the shelling of the Mariupol theatre was a ""war crime"". ""Home... for a nice cuppa"", reads the headline in the Mirror. The paper quotes Mr Ratcliffe as saying that, after six years away from home, the first thing his wife wants is a cup of tea. The Metro celebrates Nazanin's release with the headline: ""At last some good news"". One picture shows Nazanin as she landed in Oman on her way to the UK, while another shows Mr Ratcliffe and Gabriella waiting for her in the UK. The paper quotes Mr Ratcliffe as saying: ""You can't get back the time that's gone but we live in the future, not the past."" The shelling of the Mariupol theatre leads the i's front page, with the paper quoting the city's deputy mayor as saying up to 1,200 people may have been inside the building at the time. The paper quotes President Biden calling President Putin a ""war criminal"" following President Zelensky's virtual address to members of the US Congress. The Financial Times reports that progress has been made on a ""tentative peace plan"" between Russia and Ukraine. It says the plan would see Ukraine renounce any ambition to join Nato and pledge not to host foreign military bases on its territory, though adds there is concern that Moscow is simply using the talks in order to buy time and regroup its forces. ""Denise: My sex tape ordeal at 15"", reads the headline in The Sun. The paper reports new claims by TV presenter Denise Van Outen that she was filmed without her knowledge by an older man while they had sex when she was just 15 years old. Ms Van Outen tells the paper: ""I realised it's more common than ever and it has to change."" And The Star's front page reads: ""Blast Putin to Jupiter"". The paper says that a total of Â£1.6m has been raised to send Vladimir Putin to Jupiter in a space ship.

Travel firms confident they can bounce back in 2022,2022-03-17T00:15:39.000Z,"Travel firm boss, Lee Thompson, says the possibility of higher airline ticket prices will not stop most people from going abroad on holiday this year. ""The need for human connection, as we've all been isolated for so long... Everyone is desperate to meet other people and have new experiences,"" says the founder and owner of London-based firm, Flash Pack.  The travel company specialises in group adventure holidays for solo travellers in their 30s and 40s. He says the firm has seen a ""massive surge in bookings"" in recent months, and that people are so desperate to get away that they won't mind paying more for their flights, if aviation fuel prices rise as a result of the sanctions against Russian oil exports. ""Over the last couple of years we've gone from not  being able to travel at all, to spending hundreds of pounds on Covid tests each time we want to leave the country,"" adds Mr Thompson. ""After all that, I don't think increases to flight prices will stop 'Flashpackers' [or other holidaymakers] from doing something they've been dreaming about."" Within the travel industry, the past two years have been especially difficult for independent firms, as they don't have the deep pockets of the multinationals. Yet those that we spoke to are now confident that the holiday sector is going to strongly recover. Flash Pack had to go into administration in November 2020 due to the lockdowns. ""Ninety five per cent of our revenue just disappeared,"" says Radha Vyas, who co-owns the business with Mr Thompson, her husband. ""We were left with a big office in central London, 55 staff, big overheads, and no money coming in."" The firm was in administration for a few months before the couple were able to win it back after re-mortgaging their home and paying back customers who had been owned money. They relaunched the business in November 2021. ""It's really encouraging to see the business taking off again,"" adds Mr Thompson. ""And we're already on track to hit pre-pandemic levels by 2023. Booking on both sides of the Atlantic is booming, but Covid restrictions remain challenging, and we have had to become experts on them."" Lorne Blyth is the the founder of travel firm Flavours Holidays, which organises cooking, painting, pilates, language and photography classes in Italy and Spain. ""Our customers aren't so concerned about rising costs of flights,"" she says. ""Covid meant that some of them haven't managed to go on holiday abroad for over two years. So, it may cost them a bit more now, but they have the money to spend and want to get away."" Back in 2019, Edinburgh-based Flavours operated 235 Italian and Spanish trips, but then none from March 2020 to September 2020. To secure an alternative revenue stream the firm started running online classes, so that people from all around the world could learn how to paint, or taste wine, from the comfort of their own home. The firm ended up holding around 80 Zoom classes a month. ""It was a great way to keep a sense of community alive with our guests,"" says Ms Blyth. ""Some formed friendship groups online, and then organised to go on one of our holidays together [when they started up again in limited numbers in the autumn of 2020]."" Ms Blyth adds that her firm's bookings for 2022 are now ""getting back to 2019 levels"". She adds: ""It's clear that after two years people are really keen to travel again. The conversations are much more positive with people accepting testing requirements, and realising that it's just part of travel post-Covid."" New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast. Most people now just want to go on overseas holidays again, says Natalie Bannister, the owner of Cornwall-based, Gutsy Girls, which organises group adventure holidays for women. ""Based on the interest in our 2020 holidays I think everyone is just ready for an adventure,"" she says.  Before the pandemic struck, she was organising 70 trips a year. Then in March 2020 she was in Norway preparing one of her firm's holidays when the country went into lockdown. ""I had to go into quarantine, and my guests were due to come over in two days for a week's cross country ski and yoga holiday... but people were being turned away at the airport,"" says Ms Bannister. She had to shut up shop for five months, before offering a handful of trips across the later half of 2020 and last year.  ""My whole identity was in my business - it was the thing I'd put all my passion and energy into for previous two and a half years,"" says Ms Bannister. ""But then slowing down for two years was a great opportunity to perfect what we offer our guests, and now we are in a great place to grow the company sustainably. ""I'm excited to now run more trips to meet our community's demand, allowing more women to connect with each other and nature."" Despite this optimism, some working in the travel sector remain cautious. One such person is veteran industry expert and commentator Mike Bugsgang, managing director of UK travel and tourism consultancy, Bugsgang & Associates. ""Having endured the impact of a worldwide pandemic over the past two years, those travel businesses that have survived are now facing further challenges on several fronts,"" he explains. ""The huge increase in the cost of living, particularly energy and fuel, coupled with inflationary food and drink prices, is likely to impact the outbound market in the immediate term. The indications are that the domestic market, with people sticking to affordable holidays and short breaks in the UK, is predicted to benefit most in 2022."" Back at Flavours, Ms Blythe says that running a travel business means you always have to be adaptable. ""It's not going to be a straight line, it's always going to be a bit bumpy. Whether it's a new variant of Covid, or something else, you always have to look for new ways to keep your community together."""
Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in my area?,2022-03-28T16:50:30.000Z,
Selling sex to survive in Iran,2022-03-17T01:25:33.000Z,"""I am ashamed of what l am doing, but what choice do l have?"" says Neda, a divorcee in Tehran. By day she works as a hairdresser, but by night she works a second job as a prostitute, feeling forced into selling her body for sex just to make ends meet.  ""I live in a country where women are not respected, the economy is crushing, and the price of everything is going up almost every day,"" she continues. ""I am a single mum. I must take care of my son. Prostitution pays well, and now l am planning to buy a small house in downtown. This is the sad reality of my life. I am literally selling my soul."" In 2012, Iran announced a national programme to tackle prostitution. However, according to unofficial reports by non-governmental organisations (NGO) and researchers, the number of people working in the sex industry has only gone up. Iran's conservative religious establishment has officially long denied the existence of sex workers in the country. Instead, authorities allude to prostitution there as a Western plot designed to corrupt youth, or blame women for falling foul of unscrupulous men.  Unofficial data also suggests Iran's sex workers are getting younger. Statistics from various NGOs suggest that in 2016 girls as young as 12 were involved in prostitution. Aftab Society, an NGO dedicated to treatment of drug-addicted women in Iran, said in 2019 that there could be almost 10,000 female sex workers in the capital, roughly 35% of whom were married.  According to Amir Mahmoud Harrichi, a professor of social welfare at Tehran University, the figure for the number of female sex workers in Tehran could be twice as high. Given the comparative lack of job opportunities for women in Iran and absence of gender equality, many women living below poverty line have been forced to exchange sex for money. However, the work comes with great risks. ""Men know that prostitution is illegal in Iran and incurs grave punishment for women, so they use it to their advantage,"" says one part-time sex worker, Mahnaz, a student at a university in Tehran ""It has happened to me on various occasions that l had sex with someone but he didn't pay me and I couldn't go to the authorities."" Mahnaz says the cost of living in Tehran is very high and that doing other jobs will not pay her bills. Following the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, a number of sex workers were executed by the new regime and brothels were closed down. In an effort to legitimise using women for sex, the practice of what is known as zawaj al-mutaa or ""pleasure marriage"" - one that is subject to a contract that specifies its length and the amount of compensation to the temporary wife - became more prevalent. Under Iran's Shia Islamic system, a mutaa marriage is allowed, and is not considered as an act of prostitution. The practice is widespread in the holy cities of Mashhad and Qom, which are visited by Shia pilgrims from all over the world. Videos on social media show Iraqi men seeking sex in Mashhad, where officials argue that they are just engaging in temporary marriages. Now, there are countless online services offering a mutaa marriage in Iran, including on Telegram and WhatsApp, with such groups claiming they have governmental approval. One driving force behind the soaring cost of living that underlies the growth in prostitution has been the economic sanctions imposed by the US over Iran's nuclear programme. Since last year, inflation in Iran has gone up 48.6%. Unemployment has also risen and for many who do have jobs, they aren't paid well.  Against this backdrop, there has also been an increase in the number of men aged between 20 and 35 who have sex with women in exchange for getting paid. The phenomenon of male sex worker is spreading amongst major cities in Iran. One such person is Kamyar, a 28-year-old supermarket cashier, was living with his parents until last year and could not pay for his expenses without the help of his father. He can now afford to rent an apartment in central Tehran and is hoping to move abroad one day. ""I find my customers through social media accounts,"" he says. ""These women are usually in their 30s and 40s. I once had a client who was 54. They treat me well, pay good money and always sleep the night at their place. And through word of mouth, I am getting lots of clients."" Kamyar is a trained engineer but he sees no future for himself in a field that he always loved. ""I always wanted to become an engineer. But there is no job out there for me,"" he says. ""I loved a girl, but we couldn't marry because I had no proper job. I am not proud of what I'm doing now. Sleeping with strangers for money was not on my wildest dream growing up. Of course, I feel ashamed, but it pays the bills. I'm in a country where misery is the only thing I imagine for my future."" The names of those engaged in sex work featuring in this article have been changed to protect their identities."
TV classic's radio revival to reveal what Our Friends in the North did next,2022-03-17T03:08:59.000Z,"Our Friends in the North is regarded as one of the greatest British TV dramas ever made and launched the careers of its cast including Christopher Eccleston and Daniel Craig. It has now been adapted for the radio and brought up to date with a new episode set in 2020. The original series was a landmark of British television, weaving together the fortunes of four friends from Newcastle over nine episodes set between 1964 and 1995. When the show aired in 1996, it made stars of Eccleston as idealistic Nicky, Gina McKee as pragmatic Mary, Mark Strong as upwardly mobile Tosker and Daniel Craig as downtrodden Geordie. ""I hadn't looked at it for years and years and years,"" says its writer Peter Flannery, who has now revisited it to adapt it for BBC Radio 4. ""I thought it stood up pretty well. The writing was good, the production was exceptionally good and the strength of the acting has kept it young."" The show's characters were buffeted by state-of-the-nation storylines that painted a bleak picture of a country with rotten political and policing machines. Much was inspired by real-life events, such as a 1970s bribery scandal involving local politicians in the north-east, a housing developer and a home secretary; and the 1990s Westminster cash for questions affair. Not much has changed, Flannery believes.   ""The major themes of sleaze and corruption in local and national government have never gone away,"" he says. ""I think the spread of pornography and violence towards women have got worse. ""And the thing I still find the most worrying, and I did at the time, is the awful state that the Metropolitan Police is in."" Flannery often described Our Friends in the North as ""a posh soap opera with something to say"". But he has not written the new episode himself. ""I'd finished what I had to say."" Instead, the 10th instalment, which takes the story to 2020, has been penned by Manchester-born writer Adam Usden. At 33, Usden was too young to appreciate the series when it first went out, but now recognises it as ""a stone cold masterpiece"". He says: ""The scope and the scale of it is stunning. Not just the timeframe, but that the breadth of the issues that he deals with. At the same time, it's incredibly intimate. Its heart is the focus on these hugely compelling, hugely personal stories. ""It's like a photograph - you've somehow got the background and the foreground in focus at the same time."" Writing in The Guardian when the show turned 25 last year, Stuart Heritage agreed it had stood the test of time. ""Boy, does it hold up: as drama, as a piece of commentary, as a time capsule, as a showcase for young talent."" He added: ""At times, watching a show about how bad things were in the last third of the 20th-century from the perspective of 2021 make you want to shout at the characters about how good they have it."" The original episodes took place against the backdrop of a different social or political event, like general elections or the 1984 miners' strike. In his 2020 book The Age of Static: How TV Explains Modern Britain, Phil Harrison wrote that ""the quartet felt like living, breathing representatives of us, as we grappled with the dilemmas of the era"". The show ""remains a resonant work to this day"", he said, ""partly because as it concluded the sense lingered that the generation of baby boomers at its heart hadn't quite finished their upheavals. ""Two decades later - at the EU referendum in June 2016, to be precise - this suspicion would prove to be well founded. The referendum would probably have split the four friends down the middle."" It would not be much of a stretch to imagine Nicky and Mary arguing with Tosker over Brexit in the 2020 instalment, with Geordie oblivious that there had been a referendum, but feeling the effects the most. ""Those debates certainly do creep into it,"" Usden says. ""One of the main story threads of this episode follows Tosker's grandson, who was in the last scene of the of the previous series. He has a factory that does shipping parts and has very much been affected by the red tape is coming in."" Like Flannery, Usden has tried to balance the personal and the political. One of the other big themes of the original was about how parents affect - in other words, mess up - their children. ""I wanted to build on this sense of how the previous generation had shaped and impacted the people who had come after them in ways that neither generation always fully understood,"" he says. ""It was almost the perfect story to be able to pick up 25 years later, and to be able to take those core characters of Tosker, Mary, Nicky and Geordie and show how they had shaped the next generation, sometimes intentionally and lots of times in ways that perhaps they didn't intend."" Flannery says he ""never really thought about"" what might have happened to his four friends after the series ended. ""When I was asked at the time what happened to Geordie, I think my stock reply was, 'He'll probably be dead in a doorway within a couple of months.' ""He was a busted flush. He's got nothing to sustain him. He's lost all his friends again. But I hadn't really thought that through."" If they are still alive, the foursome would be in their 70s by 2020. But Usden is reluctant to reveal what has become of them in his new episode. ""All of them at the very least are referenced in some way, and throughout, because it's about their influence and their impact on those that have come after them,"" he says. ""I do absolutely pick up on characters and story threads from the original series, but hopefully in some surprising ways, and perhaps not always the characters or the stories you might expect."" Our Friends in the North is on BBC Radio 4 on Thursdays at 14:15 and on BBC Sounds. The original TV series is on Britbox."

Top Boy after George Floyd 'will be eye-opening' for some,2022-03-17T03:01:17.000Z,"Since the last season of Top Boy aired on Netflix in 2019, the conversation about race in Britain has changed. The popular show is returning to the streaming channel in the wake of the death of George Floyd and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. But police brutality and racism are not new subject matter for Top Boy, which is executively produced by Drake. The programme focuses on the realities of UK gang culture, drug dealing and the divide between rich and poor.  Actor Ashley Walters, who plays Dushane, says they have been covering issues like this since the start but some viewers might find this season more confronting because of recent events. ""Personally, I've always known that police can be heavy handed,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""That was before George Floyd, but to people that don't understand the extent of how bad it can be sometimes, it's going to be eye-opening for them, but we don't shy away from that.""  ""It's what we're about. We're not doing things for glorification value or whatever. It's what people go through."" Top Boy: How Drake went from watching the show to reviving it Ashley Walters: Top Boy sends 'real' message The cast of this year's show is as strong as previous series. Kano, Michael Ward, and Little Simz are all returning, as are Jasmine Jobson and Saffron Hocking who play sisters Jaq and Lauryn.  Saffron agrees that the show was tackling a lot of these themes on race long before the death of George Floyd in police custody. ""The Black Lives Matter protests opened everyone's eyes,"" she says. ""But I think that what Top Boy already did before BLM was show black people on TV, and it was exposing to show black people on TV, and we continue to do that."" In the past, the show has been criticised for reinforcing stereotypes about black men, but to those critics Ashley says Top Boy represents a ""specific slice of life"", not the whole Black British experience.   ""I think there's room for loads of different shows to represent different things,"" he says.  ""Our responsibility is to represent the stories of the people we're telling in the right way.""   Season four covers themes like homophobia, domestic abuse and deportation. That's something Ashley says is important. ""We're tackling issues and problems that are prominent in our society. We want to give our audience a place to debate."" Saffron echoes this and says this series is educational.  She explains: ""My character (Lauryn) is a victim of coercive control, gaslighting and stalking. And I really hope, because of the reach of Top Boy, it can go to a wide audience. ""Hopefully men watching Lauryn can perhaps take a look at themselves and their own behaviour and think 'that ain't right'.""  The pressure to make storylines authentic is something actor Jasmine Jobson is aware of.  ""We're constantly under pressure to make sure we're not glamorising things, because it's very, very easy to glamorise this lifestyle and make people feel it's exciting when really it's scary and dangerous.""  In this series, women are front and centre and that's largely led by Jasmine's character Jaq. She says it's empowering to see women can be top in whatever field they choose.  ""I only take on roles where I can change perceptions,"" she adds. ""I want women to feel that no matter what industry you're working in, you can be at the top of your game.""  Ashley agrees ""the top girls come out this season"", but with a smile on his face, adds, ""the show is always Top Boy"".   Top Boy streams on Netflix from 18 March.

Afghans turn to cryptocurrencies amid US sanctions,2022-03-16T00:49:15.000Z,"US sanctions, failing banks, and the drying up of foreign aid and cash transfers since the Taliban takeover have left Afghanistan's economy in tatters. Crypto is coming to the rescue. Following the Taliban takeover in August last year, 22-year-old Farhan Hotak from the province of Zabul in southern Afghanistan was left with no cash in hand.  Mr Hotak's sole source of income became a few hundred dollars of Bitcoin in a virtual wallet. After turning it into a traditional currency, Hotak managed to flee to Pakistan with his family of ten. ""After the Taliban takeover, crypto spread like wildfire over Afghanistan,"" he said. ""There is almost no other way to receive money"". Mr Hotak and his friends use Binance's P2P crypto exchange, which allows them to buy and sell their coins directly with other users on the platform. Finding temporary refuge in Pakistan, Mr Hotak is trading Bitcoin and Ethereum again and is now back traveling through Afghanistan, vlogging and teaching people about cryptocurrencies - digital money with no physical form that can have value. Fans of cryptocurrencies say they are the future of money and will stop people having to rely on banks. And in Afghanistan, it's banks that have stopped working, causing people to turn to cryptocurrency not just to trade, but to survive. Google trends data shows that web searches in Afghanistan for ""bitcoin"" and ""crypto"" increased in July just before the takeover in Kabul, while Afghans queued outside the banks in fruitless attempts to withdraw cash. What humanitarian aid is getting into Afghanistan? After the Taliban takeover in August 2021, the use of crypto rose sharply. Last year, the data firm Chainalysis gave Afghanistan a rank of 20 out of the 154 countries it evaluated in terms of their crypto adoption.  Just one year before, in 2020, the company considered Afghanistan's crypto presence to be so minimal as to entirely exclude it from its ranking. According to Sanzar Kakar, an Afghan American who in 2019 created HesabPay, an app that helps Afghans transfer money using crypto, the country's ""crypto revolution"" is a result of the US sanctions against the Taliban and Haqqani group, who are now in power. The sanctions have meant that transactions with Afghan banks have all but stopped. The US has seized $7.1b (Â£5.4b) worth of assets from the Afghan central bank and ended transfers of US currency. Companies in Poland and France contracted to print the Afghan currency ended shipments.  The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, known as the Swift system, which underpins international financial transactions, suspended all services in Afghanistan.  The liquidity crisis that followed meant that commercial banks couldn't lend money, and retail customers couldn't take their own money out of banks. An already war-devastated economy with 80% of its GDP coming from foreign aid and donors, Afghanistan was left on the verge of collapse.  ""We're using crypto to try to solve this problem, that 22.8 million Afghans are marching toward starvation, including one million children that might starve to death this winter,"" said Mr Kakar.  An app like Mr Kakar's HesabPay allows instant transfers of funds from one phone to another without touching banks, the Afghan government, or Taliban. In the three months since its launch, the app had over 2.1 million transactions and 380,000 active users. Aid organisations have also caught on to crypto's potential in Afghanistan. In 2013, Roya Mahboob founded Digital Citizen Fund, an NGO to teach computer programming and financial literacy to young Afghan women. The organisation had 11 women-only IT centres in Herat and another two in Kabul, where 16,000 women were taught everything from Windows software to robotics. After the Taliban takeover, the group refocused its efforts to provide young women cryptocurrency training via Zoom video calls.  Digital Citizen Fund also started sending money to Afghan families via crypto, to help them provide food and housing, and in some cases, to help people get out of the country. ""Crypto has been critical for Afghanistan in the last six months. Everybody's talking about trading. It got to a point where I got on a plane to Kabul and people were talking about Dogecoin and Bitcoin,"" Ms Mahboob told the BBC. Gaining ground in Afghanistan are the so-called ""stablecoins,"" virtual coins pegged to the US dollar, eliminating the volatility usually associated with crypto. The recipients then convert the stablecoins to the local currency at money exchanges. They can also be sent directly to recipients, without the need for a bank account.  But there are barriers that make access to cryptocurrency more difficult for an average Afghan. Access to the internet, while growing, remains low. There were 8.64 million internet users in Afghanistan in January 2021, according to DataReportal.com.  Unreliable electricity poses another major issue, as power outages are common. The country's new Taliban rulers have been accused of not paying Central Asian electricity suppliers. And with the banking system paralyzed, many Afghans don't have the means to pay their power bills. Education is also key when it comes to crypto. Mr Hotak said he found reliable online communities on Telegram, WhatsApp and Facebook that give him trading tips and offer him sound trading advice. But there is also plenty of misinformation about crypto easily found online.  Despite the steep learning curve and several barriers to entry, within Afghanistan using crypto is seen as an improvement on the status quo.  But cryptocurrencies are not a silver bullet, said. Nigel Pont, a senior advisor at HesabPay. Unlocking the restraints imposed on Afghanistan's financial situation is crucial to alleviating the growing poverty, he said.  ""It's the failures of the traditional centralised fiat system that are starving Afghanistan."" In February, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order splitting $7 billion in frozen Afghan funds between aid for Afghanistan and US victims of 9/11, who in 2010 sued the Taliban and al-Qaeda for their role in the attack.  Afghanistan's economy in crisis after Taliban take-overThe struggle to save Afghanistan's starving babies Though reports have said the administration would direct the other half of frozen Afghan foreign reserves to humanitarian groups, the executive order does not specify how the money will be released, and it remains unclear.  Most people in Afghanistan are still waiting for liquidity and unemployment relief, and the United Nations warned the country could approach a ""near-universal"" poverty rate of 97% by the middle of 2022. Millions remain on the brink of famine in the country. ""We want the US sanctions to be lifted so we can trade, so we can see our families from abroad. We want the frozen funds to be given to the families in Afghanistan,"" Mr Hotak said."

Jussie Smollett released from jail pending appeal,2022-03-17T04:00:33.000Z,"US actor Jussie Smollett has been released on bond from jail in Chicago pending an appeal against his conviction for falsely claiming he was the victim of a hate crime. Last week the former Empire star, 39, was found guilty of lying to police and sentenced to 150 days in prison. Following his sentencing, his lawyers launched an appeal. Smollett has always maintained the hoax incident, which took place in Chicago in 2019, was real. Jussie Smollett: From 2019 hoax attack to jail time He had to sign a $150,000 (Â£114,000) recognizance bond prior to his release and made no comment as he left Cook County jail surrounded by security. But his defence team said they were ""very, very happy"" with the appeal justices' ruling and said Smollett was the target of a racist justice system, CBS News reports. His team argued his imprisonment - for what was described as a low-level, non-violent crime - was excessive and that his health and safety were in danger while he remained in prison. They also questioned why he had been imprisoned after a previous prosecutor dropped the charges against him in 2019. ""Regardless of what you think about this case... the real question is, should black men be walked into jail for a Class 4 felony? Shame on you if you think they should, that's a disgrace,"" his defence attorney Nenye Uche is quoted as saying in The Chicago Tribune. The prosecuting office said the claim that his health and safety were at risk was incorrect as he had been in protective custody while in prison. The ruling stemmed from an incident three years ago when Smollett said he was attacked by two assailants. The actor, who is black and gay, said the attackers had shouted slurs and a Trump slogan, dumped a ""chemical substance"" on him and tied a noose around his neck while he was walking late at night in January 2019. Police opened an investigation into the incident but later charged Smollett with filing a false police report, saying he had staged the assault."
Dying patients living longer than expected lose NHS funds,2022-03-17T00:01:27.000Z,"More than 1,300 patients a year are having NHS funding for their palliative care withdrawn after living longer than expected, BBC analysis shows. Terminally-ill or rapidly-declining patients are given fast-track support, allowing them to live outside hospital. From 2018 to 2021, a total of 9,037 people had this funding reviewed in England and Wales, with 47% of them losing all support. The NHS said patient eligibility was assessed in line with government rules. A further 15% of patients had their continuing healthcare support replaced with the more limited NHS-funded nursing care. Sandra Hanson was referred to the fast-track pathway of the NHS continuing healthcare scheme in mid-2020, after her needs were judged by a clinician to be ""end of life"".  She was diagnosed with end-stage dementia, and had been in hospital eight times in the previous year following multiple falls and bouts of pneumonia. The funding covered the costs of a nursing home, where she suffered fewer falls. But in March 2021, this funding was reviewed by her local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). These assessments, usually undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team including health and social care professionals, consider the severity of a person's needs in areas such as mobility, cognition and behaviour. Sandra's daughter, Charlotte Gurney, said the family was represented by a social worker they had not previously met, and describes the meeting as ""traumatic"" as she tried to explain her mum's needs. ""We just felt not listened to... we were treated as if we were trying to swindle the system. ""I felt like they had an objective to cut funding to meet budgets and it didn't matter what I said."" Sandra's support was withdrawn, and she had to be moved to a new nursing home, financed by her husband Malcolm.  Shortly afterwards, she broke her wrist following a fall and injured her face. The family believe had the review correctly identified Sandra's needs and risks, this could have been avoided. Charlotte appealed against the CCG's decision to remove the funding - the first stage of which was completed several months later. The support was reinstated, but not fully backdated - leaving Malcolm more than Â£10,000 short. The appeal had been ongoing, but since being contacted by the BBC, South West London CCG has now overturned its decision and said it will backdate the money. A spokesperson said it worked with ""patients and their family, carers and nursing homes... to carefully consider each individual case"".  The fast-track continuing healthcare scheme pays for all an individual's palliative care needs and is not means-tested. To qualify, there must be evidence of a rapidly-deteriorating condition that may be entering a terminal phase. Guidelines state this should not be ""interpreted narrowly"" as meaning only those with a ""short time frame of life remaining"". But in many cases where a patient remains alive beyond their prognosis, reviews are being used to decide on their continued eligibility - often taking place three months after their funding began. Data from 86 of the 117 CCGs and health boards in England and Wales, collated by the BBC through Freedom of Information requests, shows 9,037 fast-track continuing healthcare patients had their funding reviewed through a Decision Support Tool (DST) assessment between 2018-19 and 2020-21. Of those patients, 47% were found no longer eligible for palliative care funding, 15% were provided with NHS-funded nursing care, and 38% remained eligible. But there is great regional variation - in some areas, more than 80% of reassessed patients were found to be no longer eligible. In other areas, the figure was below 20%. Where a patient's funding is removed, the assessors will usually refer the individual's family to the social care system, believing this can adequately meet their needs. Andrew Farley, from specialist law firm Farley-Dwek Solicitors, said the percentage of those having their funding removed seemed ""exceptionally high"". He described the assessments as being used ""often as a cost-saving exercise by the NHS designed to withdraw funding from as many people as possible, even where it might not be appropriate"". In most instances, the cost per patient to the NHS over a year would be in the tens of thousands of pounds. Mr Farley added that the failure of many nursing home providers to keep ""an accurate record"" of patients' needs could also lead to decisions being made incorrectly. Dan Harbour, from the organisation Beacon which advises families, said reviews ""should focus on whether an individual's needs are still being met and whether the care package is adequate to support them"". But, he added, in some cases it may be appropriate to reassess eligibility where an individual's condition has stabilised. In England, the responsibility for commissioning continuing healthcare is transferring away from CCGs to newly-formed Integrated Care Systems. An NHS spokesperson said across England more than 260,000 people were given fast-track support between 2018-19 and 2020-21. The Department of Health and Social Care said its continuing healthcare guidelines allow patients to ""receive appropriate care quickly... taking into account the overall needs of the individual"". Northern Ireland does not operate a fast-track scheme, while Scotland uses an alternative system to continuing healthcare. "
Scientists claim hairy black holes explain Hawking paradox,2022-03-17T04:57:23.000Z,"Scientists say they have solved one of the biggest paradoxes in science first identified by Prof Stephen Hawking. He highlighted that black holes behave in a way that puts two fundamental theories at odds with each other. Black holes are dead stars that have collapsed and have such strong gravity that not even light can escape.  New research claims to have resolved the paradox by showing that black holes have a property which they call ""quantum hair"". ""The problem has been cracked!"" Prof Xavier Calmet of the University of Sussex, told BBC News exclusively, with much satisfaction. He was among those who developed the mathematical techniques they say has  solved the paradox.  At the heart of the paradox is a problem which has threatened to  undermine two of physics most important theories. Einstein's general theory of relativity says information about what goes into a black hole cannot come out, but quantum mechanics says that is impossible. Prof Calmet and his colleagues say they have shown that the constituents of the star leave an imprint in the black hole's gravitational field.  The scientists named the imprint ""quantum hair"" because their theory supersedes an earlier idea called the ""no hair theorem"" developed by Prof John Archibald Wheeler of Princeton University in New Jersey in the 1960s. Prof Wheeler came up with the name because it conveys the mathematical description of a black hole: an entity which has mass, spin and charge but is otherwise has no other physical features, bald if you like. Prof Calmet's ""yes hair theorem"", published in the journal Physical Review Letters is revolutionary. It claims to resolve the Hawking paradox which has deeply troubled physicists ever since Prof Hawking came up with it in the 1970s.  The paradox raised the possibility that either quantum mechanics or general relativity might be flawed, which is a terrifying prospect for theoretical physicists because they are the twin pillars on which most most of our understanding of the Universe rests. First ever black hole image releasedTaking the temperature of black holesHawking: Black holes store information The ""yes hair theorem"" claims to resolve the paradox by bridging the gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics. The notion of quantum hair allows information about what goes into a black hole to come out again without violating any of the important principles of either theory. It is a simple and elegant solution. ""But it is going to take some time for people to accept it,"" says Prof Calmet.  That is because it is such a big deal in the world of theoretical physics. ""Hawking came up with the paradox in the year that I was born,"" says Prof Calmet.  Ever since then, many famous physicists around the world have been working on it, proposing very dramatic things to explain it, including some who had suggested that some aspects of quantum mechanics is wrong.  ""So it is going to take a while for people to accept that you don't need a radical solution to crack the issue,"" Prof Calmet said. If the ""yes hair theorem"" stands up to scrutiny, he said it could be the first step in connecting the theories of relativity - which concern gravity and quantum mechanics which largely focus on the three other forces of nature, which are electromagnetism and two nuclear forces. ""One of the consequences of the Hawking paradox was that general relativity and quantum mechanics was incompatible. What we are finding is that they are very much compatible."" The research team, which also includes Prof Roberto Casadio of the University of Bologna and Prof Stephen Hsu from Michigan State University, built on the work of Prof Suvrat Raju of the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, in Bengaluru in India. Prof Raju, with several collaborators, has previously shown that all the information inside a black hole can be recovered from outside as a consequence of the effects of quantum gravity. ""In the past few years, it has been recognized that the no hair theorem fails due to quantum effects and this resolves Hawking's paradox,"" he said. Follow Pallab on Twitter"
'Dangerous' tanning products promoted by influencers,2022-03-17T05:53:19.000Z,"Dozens of social-media influencers are promoting banned tanning products to millions of followers, a BBC News investigation has found. It is illegal in the UK to sell nasal sprays or injectables made with ""melanotan-2"", an artificial hormone that can accelerate tanning. The unlicensed drug is dangerous, dermatologists say, and users should stop immediately. And there is evidence the untested products may be linked to skin cancer.  The Advertising Standards Authority says all influencers must act responsibly, including ensuring products and the companies they link to are not acting illegally. Watch ' Toxic tans': Dangerous tanning products uncovered on iPlayer Liv and Elaina both longed for a tan like the models on their social-media feeds. When influencers and friends started sporting golden-brown skin, they wanted to know their secret.  Soon, Liv was ordering tanning injections from a UK-based website.  Elaina opted for a nasal spray, which she bought on social media.  For two months, Liv, from Leeds, jabbed her stomach and then went on a sunbed, which she had been told would ""activate"" the drug.  It gave her headaches but she felt it was worth it - until, eight months later, she found a strangely shaped mole on her thigh. ""It was dark and raised, about the size of a pea,"" she says.  ""I'm not a 'moley' person, so I knew something wasn't right."" Doctors agreed with Liv.  But shortly after the mole was removed, she was diagnosed with stage-one melanoma, a skin cancer that can be life-threatening. Liv needed surgery to remove the cancerous tissue around the area where the mole had been and her dermatologist told her the injections were the likely cause. ""A cancer diagnosis is terrifying, never mind when you're 27 years old,"" she says.  Within minutes of her first nasal spray, Elaina's face ""burned up"" and turned bright red. ""I was told my body just needed to get used to it,"" she says.  ""A week later, my throat started to close up - I literally couldn't breathe.""  The 19-year-old, from Stockton-on-Tees, Durham, needed hospital treatment and was diagnosed with a serious throat and sinus infection. Doctors told her inhaling the tanning product was the cause and they had seen other patients develop similar symptoms after using it. BBC News has spoken to 20 people who have experienced complications, including lesions, fungal infections and abscesses. Melanotan-2 can increase the production of melanin, the pigment that darkens skin, but it has never had rigorous safety testing. Social-media sites have propelled the drug, previously sold in some gyms and salons, into the mainstream, with the trend mainly driven by young, white women. The recent introduction of a nasal spray can also make it seem more appealing. The British Association of Dermatologists is now on the alert for patients with warning signs of ""unusual orange tans"" and ""disordered moles"". Some sellers claim their products are safe - but Dr Catherine Borysiewicz, from the association, says the only safe tan is fake tan. ""We have evidence these products are potentially dangerous and can potentially lead to cancer,"" she says.  ""We have cases which have shown melanoma developing after trying them.  ""I talk about skin risks - but who knows what else it might be doing?"" Dozens of influencers have posted about using melanotan-2.  It is not illegal to use or promote these tanning products, despite the health risks, but it is illegal to sell them. Geordie Shore star Bethan Kershaw recently told her 700,000 followers she had used nasal sprays from a company called Real Tan.  Both she and the company declined to comment.  Other influencers are more explicit - TikTok star Lauren demonstrated on camera how to inhale the drug. A company had offered the 26-year-old, from Glasgow, free nasal sprays if she would promote their products.  But after two months, she stopped taking them because they made her feel sick. ""As an influencer, I need to be more careful what I'm promoting,"" Lauren says.  ""I have got to look out for my followers, a lot of them are young."" BBC News has also seen many examples of celebrities directing their followers to businesses selling melanotan-2 products. The most high-profile example is reality-TV star Charlotte Crosby, who on one occasion told her followers to ""check out"" Real Tan and tagged the company in a separate post talking about her tan. A representative for Ms Crosby, who has 7.6 million Instagram followers, says she ""would never knowingly promote a company illegally selling unlicensed products"". We are told she has only ever used items from Real Tan which do not contain melanotan-2; these are moisturising creams ""gifted to her"" and gels she posted about as a favour, to promote their launch. But these clarifications were not mentioned in her posts. And there was no mention of creams or gels in Real Tan's price list after Ms Crosby posted about the seller, only injections and nasal sprays. A more recent price list says ""sun accelerator creams available soon"". BBC News asked research chemists at Imperial College London to analyse 10 tanning kits. They would expect to find about 10 ingredients in a licensed medicine but were shocked to discover some of the products contained more than 100 unidentified ingredients. They also confirmed the presence of melanotan-2. ""If you don't know what you're taking, you should probably avoid it,"" Prof Tony Cass says. He likened the risk to Russian roulette but added: ""It's more like using a machine gun than a pistol."" The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says it has spent 10 years targeting melanotan products. Instagram and TikTok say selling the drug on their platforms is banned and promotional content will be taken down. ""We care deeply about the health and wellbeing of our community. We do not allow the promotion of controlled substances,"" says A TikTok spokesperson. But despite this, the illegal tanning industry is thriving. Some contributors' surnames have been withheld"
Interest rates rise again to counter higher prices,2022-03-17T16:46:34.000Z,"Interest rates have increased for the third time in four months as the Bank of England tries to calm the rise in the cost of living. The rise from 0.5% to 0.75% means rates are now at their highest level since March 2020, when Covid lockdowns began. Energy bills and food costs are increasing and there is concern the war in Ukraine will push prices up further. The Bank has warned inflation, the rate at which prices rise, may reach 8% and possibly higher, in the coming months. Explaining why it had lifted its forecast, it said that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia ""has led to further large increases in energy and other commodity prices including food prices. ""It is also likely to exacerbate global supply chain disruptions, and has increased the uncertainty around the economic outlook significantly,"" it added.  Prices had already increased by 5.5% in the year to January, the fastest rate for 30 years and well above the Bank's 2% inflation target. The Office for National Statistics  (ONS) said that energy and fuel prices had contributed to the rising cost of living. How the interest rate rise might affect youHow high could UK interest rates go? The Bank's policymakers cited the rising cost of living and strong employment as the reasons for the latest rate rise. The members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) felt that ""given the current tightness of the labour market, continuing signs of robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those pressures will persist"", an interest rate rise was justified. It also warned that inflation could hit double-digits later in the year if energy prices push up the energy price cap. The MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 for the move, with deputy Bank governor Jon Cunliffe the only member to vote for keeping rates unchanged. He said this was because of the impact of rapid price rises on household incomes. The committee said that more interest rate rises ""might be appropriate in coming months, but there were risks on both sides of that judgement depending on how medium-term prospects evolved."" The invasion of Ukraine was likely to push prices up even faster than the Bank expected at its last meeting in February, it added. ""The economy had recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russia's invasion of Ukraine was another such shock,"" it wrote. Morag Milligan, the operations manager at Milligan's Coaches in East Ayrshire, said that the business had barely recovered from the shock of coronavirus-related lockdowns and travel restrictions. Citing rising fuel prices, she said: ""It feels it's just never-ending for the industry... it's crisis after crisis."" The company has seen an 8% increase in fuel costs which had been a drain on resources. ""The increase just makes it harder and harder to run,"" she said.  About two million households will see an immediate increase in their mortgage payments as a result of the rise in rates, according to UK Finance. The increase will add about Â£26 a month to the cost of a typical tracker mortgage, and Â£16 to the cost of a typical standard variable rate mortgage. The Bank said that higher global prices for energy and other goods were responsible for the faster rise in inflation than the MPC predicted at its last rate-setting meeting. However, it expects inflation to ""fall back materially"" once prices stop rising and the impact of inflation on household incomes starts to bite. While the headline impact of a rise in rates will be felt by homeowners on variable rate mortgages, the big change today was in the mood music at the Bank of England.  Last month, it indicated that the rise was the first in a series likely over the coming months. That language has been toned down and indeed there was one member of the committee who voted to keep them on hold. This indicates that the Bank is nervous about the economic impact of the massive rise in energy and food prices. More nervous than it is about the fact that already eye-watering 30 year highs for inflation, are not just going to be even higher at 8%, but potentially breach that by the end of the year. The Russian invasion is one of a series of so-called ""stagflationary"" shocks, that send both growth figures and inflation figures in the wrong direction.  There is not much the Bank can do to stop the energy price cap and food prices sending the increase in the cost of living to 9 or 10%. But it is signalling its concern about the overall impact on the economy of a prolonged hit to consumers, from events 1,500 miles away. But the union Unite hit out at the Bank's decision, with its general secretary Sharon Graham saying that it comes at a time when ""millions of working people are facing the worst cost-of-living crisis for generations"". ""This rise will put even more pressure on household finances as inflation and energy bills continue to skyrocket."" Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that energy bills were already set to increase in April with the rise in the energy price cap. The British Chambers of Commerce argued that higher rates will do little to curb some of the global causes behind the surge in prices and risk intensifying the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses. Suren Thiru, its head of economics, urged the chancellor to use his Spring Statement on 23 March to tackle the ""cost of doing business crisis"" by delaying the National Insurance rise and introducing a temporary energy price cap for businesses.  ""This would give firms the headroom to keep a lid on prices, protect jobs and make investment that is so vital to sustaining our economic prospects."" "
Outrage and no ferries after mass P&O sackings,2022-03-18T01:30:55.000Z,"P&O Ferries has sparked outrage after sacking 800 staff with plans to replace them with cheaper agency workers.  Staff were told in a video call that Thursday was their ""final day of employment"", but some refused to leave their ships in protest and were removed.  P&O said it was a ""tough"" decision but it would ""not be a viable business"" without the changes. But the government called the workers' treatment ""wholly unacceptable"". And the RMT union is threatening legal action against the ferry company, calling it one of the ""most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations"". Further protests on Friday are being organised in Dover, Liverpool and Hull. ""Reports of workers being given zero notice and escorted off their ships... shows the insensitive way in which P&O have approached this issue,"" said Robert Courts, parliamentary under secretary for transport. ""I am extremely concerned and frankly angry at the way workers have been treated by P&O."" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Mr Courts said the company had told him it will be suspending services for ""a week to 10 days while they locate new crew"" on the Dover to Calais, Larne to Cairnryan, Dublin to Liverpool and Hull to Rotterdam routes. On Friday morning, the company again said on Twitter it would not run services ""for the next few days"". Meanwhile, the Department for Transport says neither the Secretary of State, Grant Shapps, nor Mr Courts, was aware of what was happening with P&O until Thursday. The BBC has seen details of a contract for handcuff-trained security professionals which began two days before they were deployed to Dover to remove staff from ferries. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said P&O's ""secret plan"" to sack staff with no notice was ""reprehensible"".   P&O passengers were told to use DFDS while services were suspended. Crew on one ship docked at Larne Harbour in Northern Ireland had lifted the gangway after private security officers arrived to remove them.  The crew has now left the ship and Gary Jackson, a full time officer and RMT union member onboard the Pride of Hull, said they were ""absolutely devastated"". 'We've been abandoned by P&O' say sacked staff ""At 11am ratings and officers were informed there was going to be a pre-recorded Zoom meeting. After that two to three-minute call all the crew were made redundant,"" he said. ""I've seen grown men crying on there because they don't know where they're going to go from today."" James, who has worked for P&O Ferries in Dover for around four years, said he felt abandoned by the company after all he received ""was a three minute pre-recorded message saying we are out of a job. Nothing else."" ""It was a complete surprise. I would have understood if it was at the height of Covid, but now we're seeing the end of travel restrictions and the start of summer bookings. So this has come completely out of the blue,"" he said. Mark Canet-Baldwin, from Hull, was one of the agency workers brought to Cairnryan to take over from the crew that were being sacked.  But after talking it through with his wife, he said: ""I felt I can't do it. I felt sick to my stomach. And I walked off. Two others came with me. It's just wrong."" Workers are reported to have been escorted off their ships while being told that cheaper alternatives will take up their roles. ""The approach adopted by P&O is not unheard of, but it is exceptional to forego appropriate notice and consultation processes,"" said Nathan Donaldson, employment solicitor at Keystone Law. He said a government review of firing and rehiring in November 2021 did not outlaw the practice but emphasised ""that it should be a process of last resort"". Rustom Tata, chairman and head of the employment group at law firm DMH Stallard, said P&O's actions would affect the brand's reputation due to the ""apparently wholly planned approach being taken to such a large proportion of its workforce ignoring some of the basic fundamentals of employee relations."" Ann Francke, chief executive of The Chartered Management Institute, said P&O had ""got it very wrong"". ""It's shocking and appalling. It's like management behaviour from another era,"" she said. P&O said its survival was dependent on ""making swift and significant changes now"". ""We have made a Â£100m loss year on year, which has been covered by our parent DP World. This is not sustainable. Without these changes there is no future for P&O Ferries."" The cross-Channel operator said on Twitter that sailings between Dover and Calais scheduled for Thursday will no longer run, and customers with tickets were instructed to sail with rival ferry company DFDS. P&O Ferries is one of the UK's leading ferry companies, carrying more than 10 million passengers a year before the pandemic and about 15% of all freight cargo in and out of the UK. However, like many transport operators it saw demand slump in the pandemic. The firm claimed almost Â£15m in government grants in 2020, which included furlough payments for its employees. P&O is owned by DP World, the multi-national ports and logistics company based in Dubai. It paid a Â£270m dividend to shareholders in 2020. Diane Riley has travelled with a friend from Hull to Rotterdam with P&O for a Northern Soul event. She was on a day trip to Amsterdam on Thursday when she heard from her daughter in the UK that P&O had suspended its services. ""It was a shock,"" says Diane, adding: ""I thought she was joking at first.""  She got a text from the company at around 4pm, advising her to return to the ferry to spend the night. She says passengers have been told they may be put on a DFDS ferry to Newcastle on Friday morning, and will then be taken back to Hull by coach. ""We don't know anything for certain - we'll have to wait and see what happens when we get back to the ferry,"" she says.  Meanwhile, Lauren Shaw and her husband told the BBC they were booked with P&O to travel on a ferry from Cairnryan to Larne at 4pm on Thursday. ""We had a phone call at 10am to tell us there would be no sailings today and that they hadn't been told a reason why,"" she said.   They travelled to the port in the hope getting a ferry, but said: ""It's really frustrating."" Are you affected by issues covered in this story? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Ocado sales hit as workers return to the office,2022-03-17T09:37:24.000Z,"Ocado has reported a fall in sales as customers return to pre-pandemic shopping habits and costs increase. In the three months to the end of February, retail sales for the online grocer fell 5.7% to Â£574.7m. It said the return to the office by workers and the ""euphoria"" of going back out to restaurants after restrictions eased had reduced demand. Rising costs and changing shopping habits saw the group cut its sales forecast for the year. It now expects annual retail revenue growth ""closer to 10%"", rather than in the mid-teens, as it said last month. But the results for its latest quarter also reflected a tough comparison from a year before, when the UK was in lockdown, Ocado added. Worst to come for food price rises - TescoShop prices rise at fastest rate in a decade ""The main thing that we're seeing [now] is people's willingness to behave more like they did pre-Covid,"" Ocado said. ""We've got two off-setting things at the moment though, where some people are still working from home several days a week- and that is a 'basket booster'.  ""But that is getting offset by a bit of euphoria about that fact we can go back out to a restaurant, having been cooped up for two years [during Covid-related restrictions]."" Compared with pre-pandemic levels, Ocado's retail sales in the quarter were up 31.7%. ""The last quarter has been encouraging for Ocado Retail despite the clearly evident challenges the industry and consumers are facing,"" said Melanie Smith, Ocado Retail's boss.  ""As we have seen since the end of Covid restrictions, the value of the average basket and shape of the week continue to normalise as we return towards the rhythm of our pre-Covid lives."" Although it saw a 15% drop in the average customer's basket size, Ocado said it was encouraged by an increase in the number of new shoppers on the platform. But the retailer acknowledged that war in Ukraine and uncertainty over how demand will change during the cost of living crisis meant it was difficult to predict sales. It said it had increased the prices of some products already ""where costs could not be mitigated"". However, it is not yet seeing price rises as high as the current rate of inflation, which stands at 5.5% - the highest level seen in 30 years. The group also insisted that it was a ""price follower"", which tries to match the prices of its big competitors.  Tesco's chairman warned recently that ""the worst is yet to come"" on rising food prices. John Allan told the BBC he was aware people were on very tight budgets and having to choose between food and heating ""troubles us"", but added that grocers and suppliers were not immune from rising energy costs. Ocado noted that it might be affected by rising energy costs in particular, due to the amount required to power the refrigerators in its distribution hubs and fuel required for its drivers. Separately, online delivery giant Deliveroo reported that its losses have deepened as the costs of its rapid expansion stack up. The company posted a Â£298m pre-tax loss for the year, compared with a Â£213m loss in 2020, but stressed that it had a long-term plan for profitability. It said its heavy losses for the past year were driven by big investments in marketing and technology improvements as it sought to keep up the momentum of orders being boosted during lockdowns, similar to Ocado. In its UK business, order numbers increased by 72%. But it also predicted a slowdown in growth over the coming year.  Susannah Streeter, senior markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""For now it does appear that some pandemic habits are sticking around, with restaurant deliveries staying popular, on-call groceries increasingly in demand and a growing source of revenue for Deliveroo.  ""But the cost-of-living squeeze is intensifying and as savings are eaten away, there may be less appetite to pay for an easier life."""
Kanye West: Rapper suspended from Instagram for 24 hours,2022-03-17T11:27:21.000Z,"Kanye West has been suspended from Instagram for 24 hours after using a racial slur in reference to comedian Trevor Noah. The rapper posted about him after he said Kanye's actions towards his ex-wife Kim Kardashian were ""terrifying"". Kanye's been criticised for repeatedly posting remarks about Kim, their children and her partner Pete Davidson. Meta, which owns Instagram, said the rapper violated the platform's policies on hate speech and bullying. The company also said its policies on harassment had been violated. Although his account remains visible, Kanye is unable to do things like post, comment or send direct messages. Other recent posts from Kanye have accused Kim of stopping him from seeing their children - something she's denied. In a statement, Meta said it would take ""additional steps"" if it saw further violations of its policies. ""We often take additional steps against accounts that repeatedly break our rules by placing restrictions on their account,"" said the statement. Meta added that it had also ""deleted content"" from Kanye's account. The comments from Trevor Noah were made during an episode of the satirical news show which he hosts, The Daily Show. ""You may not feel sorry for Kim because she's rich and famous,"" he said. ""But what she's going through is terrifying to watch and shines a spotlight on what so many women go through when they choose to leave."" Kim Kardashian declared single in divorce with YeKanye and Drake end feud for Larry Hoover gig Kanye - who has legally changed his name to Ye - has been locked in a public feud with both Kim and Pete Davidson, regularly posting screenshots of private conversations between the three. In response to Trevor Noah's comments, Kanye posted a screenshot of a Google search for the comedian on his Instagram account, accompanied by the lyrics to 'Kumbaya, My Lord', which he changed to include a racial slur.

Rethink over crackdown on MPs' second jobs,2022-03-17T12:22:52.000Z,"Limiting the amount of time MPs spend on second jobs would be ""impractical"", the government has said.  Boris Johnson called for a review of MPs' outside work last year after a number of high-profile controversies. At the time, the prime minister backed proposals to place ""reasonable limits"" on hours spent on other jobs. But Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay has now said the measure would not work and also cast doubt on a proposed cap on outside earnings.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the prime minister of ""breaking his promise"" to tackle ""a scandal of his own making"" over second jobs. MPs under scrutiny over their second jobsMPs back government plans to curb second jobs The issue of MPs' second jobs came to the fore in 2021 when the then-Conservative MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules.  It caused chaos in government and accusations of sleaze after No 10 attempted an overhaul of the standards system, which would have stopped Mr Paterson from being suspended from the Commons. He later resigned as an MP.  The furore led to increased scrutiny of the work MPs do outside of Parliament, with a lot of focus on former Attorney General Sir Geoffrey Cox, who earned around Â£900,000 in 2020 through his work as a lawyer. MPs later backed government plans to prevent them taking on certain jobs, with No 10 saying any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be ""within reasonable limits"" and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents. A definition of what that meant was not given, but International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan suggested 15 hours a week as a reasonable limit. However, in the letter from Mr Barclay, the government now appears to have moved away from that pledge. The minister reiterated the government's desire for a ban on MPs providing paid parliamentary advice, consultancy, or strategy services. But while he acknowledged a time limit was considered ""necessary"" by some, he said it would be ""impractical"".  In a submission to the Commons standards committee, first reported by the Guardian, Mr Barclay wrote: ""It is the government's initial view that the imposition of fixed constraints such as time limits on the amount of time that members can spend on outside work would be impractical.  ""The imposition of time limits would not necessarily serve to address recent concerns over paid advocacy and the primary duty of MPs to serve their constituents.""  When it came to a cap on earnings, Mr Barclay also had his doubts, writing that such a rule ""could serve to prohibit activities which do not bring undue influence to bear on the political system"", such as writing books. He said a long-serving MP ""could inadvertently reach the 'ceiling' through earnings accrued over time"", and he questioned ""whether it would be fair to subject that member to a standards investigation"".  He added: ""To avoid this issue would require a substantive earning threshold to be set such that it would not serve to prevent MPs from taking on outside work for which they were properly remunerated in line with salaries in that sector.  ""The introduction of such an arbitrary cap therefore may not have the intended effect of ensuring that members prioritise their parliamentary duties and the needs of their constituents."" But Labour's Sir Keir hit out at the PM for failing to deliver on his promise to tackle the issue. ""[Mr Johnson] said he was going to deal with second jobs and there was going to be this cap,"" he told reporters.  ""That was his proposal at the height of this scandal of his own making.  ""Now, as soon as he gets the opportunity, he is breaking his promise yet again."" He added: ""It goes to the heart of the problem with this prime minister, which is this problem of trust and moral authority."""
Online Harms Bill: Cyber-flashing added to proposed legislation,2022-03-17T16:19:23.000Z,"Measures to criminalise cyber-flashing and give a right to appeal against the removal of social media posts are among changes the government has proposed to its Online Harms Bill. The bill, which also seeks to tackle access to harmful material online, has been introduced to parliament. It would give regulator Ofcom the power to fine firms or block access to sites that fail to comply with the new rules. But Labour says delays to the bill mean disinformation in the UK has increased. The bill - originally announced in 2019 - covers a wide array of topics relating to harmful material online. Online Safety Bill: New offences and tighter rulesHarmful and illegal content could evade new laws, MPs warnFacebook is 'making hate worse', whistleblower says Big social media companies will be required to assess risks of the types of legal harms against adults which could arise on their services, and will have to set out how they will deal with them - and enforce these terms consistently. Definitions of these legal harms will be set out in additional legislation, but potential examples could include material promoting self-harm, eating disorders or harassment.  Some of the additional aspects of the bill announced as it was introduced to Parliament include: Criminalising the sending of unsolicited sexual images to people using social media, known as cyber-flashing Giving people the right to appeal if they feel their social media posts were removed unfairlyPreventing online scams, such as paid-for fraudulent adverts, investment fraud and romance scammersRequiring pornography websites to verify their users' ages Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the bill meant technology companies would not be left to ""check their own homework"". ""Tech firms haven't been held to account when harm, abuse and criminal behaviour have run riot on their platform,"" she said. The bill will give new powers to Ofcom, which will be able to request information from companies, and executives who do not comply could face up to two years in prison within two months of the bill becoming law.  Senior managers would also be criminally liable if they destroyed evidence, did not attend an Ofcom interview, provided false information, or otherwise obstructed the regulator from entering offices. Any firm breaching the rules would face a fine of up to 10% of its turnover, while non-compliant websites could be blocked entirely. Children's charity Barnardo's welcomed the announcement sites showing pornographic material would have to check the ages of users. ""We know from our work with children and young people across the UK that exposure to pornography can have a harmful impact on their mental health and understanding of what makes a healthy relationship,"" chief executive Lynn Perry said. And a City of London Police Authority Board spokesperson said included paid-for advertising in the legislation was ""a major step forward in the fight to reduce online crime, and helps cement the benefits of including fraud as a priority harm"". But shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell likened said the bill's delays had ""allowed the Russian regime's disinformation to spread like wildfire online"".  She added: ""Other groups have watched and learned their tactics, with Covid conspiracy theories undermining public health and climate deniers putting our future at risk."" The legislation has taken some time to reach the stage where a bill is now to be laid before Parliament.  An Online Harms White Paper was first introduced in April 2019 by the Conservative government - then led by Theresa May. At the time, privacy organisations such as the Open Rights Group warned that the bill could threaten freedom of expression. Commenting on the length of the delay, Jim Killock, Open Rights Group executive director said: ""The fact that the bill keeps changing its content after four years of debate should tell everyone that it is a mess, and likely to be a bitter disappointment in practice."""
Music experts disagree in Ed Sheeran court case,2022-03-17T11:25:15.000Z,"Music experts have given contrasting views over whether Ed Sheeran copied the work of another singer when he wrote his 2017 single Shape Of You. The star denies stealing the chorus of Sami Switch's Oh Why for the ""oh I, oh I, oh I"" hook of his hit song. Forensic musicologists were called by both sides to argue the case at London's High Court.  One said the songs were ""distinctly different"" but the other argued they contained ""significant similarities"". Shape Of You was the world's best-selling song of 2017, with more than three billion plays on Spotify alone. The track earns Sheeran and his co-writers Steven McCutcheon and Johnny McDaid about Â£5m a year, despite almost 10% of the payments being frozen due to the ongoing copyright dispute, the court heard. Wednesday's testimony came from copyright consultant Christian Siddell and Anthony Ricigliano, a former head of music theory at the Manhattan School of Music, who previously helped Led Zeppelin win a plagiarism trial over Stairway To Heaven. In a joint written statement, they agreed that ""when heard in the context of their respective works, the words 'Oh why' and 'Oh I' may be phonetically indistinguishable from each other to the casual listener"". They also agreed that neither of them had found ""the same combination"" of phonetic sounds, pitch and rhythm ""in any other compositions"". Songwriter says he 'feels robbed' by Ed SheeranEd Sheeran co-writer calls plagiarism abhorrentEd Sheeran sings Nina Simone during copyright case However, they differed on whether Sheeran had copied his song from Sami Switch, whose real name is Sami Chokri, and his co-writer Ross O'Donoghue. Mr Ricigliano, who was instructed by Sheeran's lawyers but told the court he was ""completely impartial"", said he considered the extent of the alleged similarities to be ""overstated"". He wrote that ""the overall design and musical development of the melodic, harmonic and lyrical content in the relevant phrase in Shape Of You are distinctively different from that utilised in Oh Why"". Calling the similarities ""coincidental"", he added that it was ""objectively unlikely"" that any overlap came as a ""result from copying"". In his written evidence, Sheeran noted that his song's ""Oh I"" melody is based on ""a basic minor pentatonic pattern"" which is ""entirely commonplace"". Mr Ricigliano agreed, paraphrasing a quote from West Side Story composer Leonard Bernstein: ""The pentatonic scale is humanity's favourite scale and is so well known that one can find examples of it from all corners of the Earth"". In court, Andrew Sutcliffe QC, representing Mr Chokri and Mr O'Donoghue, asked him: ""You accept, don't you Mr Ricigliano, that despite all your research you have not found any examples in any corner of the earth over the past 200 years which sound phonetically the same as the chorus in Oh Why and the post chorus in Shape Of You?"" ""That's correct,"" Mr Ricigliano said. ""Do you not find this extraordinary?"" Mr Sutcliffe asked, with the expert replying: ""No"". Mr Siddell, who was instructed by Mr Chokri's lawyers, disagreed, saying the similarities between the two songs were ""so numerous and striking that the possibility of independent creation isâ¦ highly improbable"". He said the two melodies were ""nearly identical in respect of their rhythm and pitch"", the phonetic sounds of the vocal lines were ""musically indistinguishable to the ear"" and other compositional similarities included the use of ""phrase repetition"" and ""the musical dynamics"". The crossover was ""unlikely to be the consequence of coincidence"", he added. ""Had I been consulted in a 'copyright compliance' capacity as to whether a licence should be sought from the writers of Oh Why, my guidance would have been, in summary, that either the melodic phrase should be omitted and replaced with original new material or a licence should be obtained."" Sheeran and his co-writers deny copying Mr Chokri's song, stating they had not heard it before the copyright claim was raised. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Why has Russia invaded Ukraine and what does Putin want?,2022-03-29T20:55:18.000Z,"When Vladimir Putin shattered the peace in Europe by unleashing war on a democracy of 44 million people, his justification was that modern, Western-leaning Ukraine was a constant threat and Russia could not feel ""safe, develop and exist"". But after almost five weeks of bombardment, thousands of deaths in ruined cities and the displacement of 10 million people inside Ukraine and beyond, the questions remain: what is his aim and is there a way out? The Russian leader's initial aim was to overrun Ukraine and depose its government, ending for good its desire to join the Western defensive alliance Nato. But the invasion has become bogged down and he appears to have scaled back his ambitions. Launching the invasion on 24 February he told the Russian people his goal was to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine"", to protect people subjected to what he called eight years of bullying and genocide by Ukraine's government. ""It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian territory. We do not intend to impose anything on anyone by force,"" he insisted. This was not even a war or invasion, he claimed, merely the fiction of a ""special military operation"" that Russian state-controlled media are required to adopt. The claims of Nazis and genocide in Ukraine were completely unfounded, but it was clear Russia saw this as a pivotal moment. ""Russia's future and its future place in the world are at stake,"" said foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin. Russia's military aimed to sweep into the capital Kyiv, invading from Belarus in the north, as well as from the south and east.   Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of freeing Ukraine from oppression, while Ukraine's democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky said ""the enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two"".  But Ukraine's fierce resistance has caused heavy losses and, in some areas, driven Russian forces back. Russia does appear to have lowered its ambitions, claiming it has ""generally accomplished"" the aims of the invasion's first phase, which it defined as considerably reducing Ukraine's combat potential. At peace talks in Istanbul, Russia said it would be ""drastically reducing"" its military operations around the capital, and around the northern city of Chernihiv. Ukraine's President Zelensky said signals from the talks could be called positive, but that they did not drown out the explosions from Russian shells. He said Ukraine could only trust a concrete result, not words. The war continues in the east and the south, where Russian forces are trying to create a land corridor along the south coast, east from Crimea to the Russian border. A month into the invasion, Russia declared its main goal was the ""liberation of Donbas"" - broadly referring to Ukraine's eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. More than a third of this area was already seized by Russian-backed separatists in a war that began in 2014.  Ahead of the war it was clear President Putin wanted all of the east, recognising the whole area as belonging to two Russian puppet statelets. The head of the Luhansk statelet has suggested holding a referendum on joining Russia, similar to an internationally discredited vote held in Crimea in 2014. Beyond his military goals, President Putin's broader demand is to ensure Ukraine's future neutrality. The Ukrainians have offered that in return for security guarantees from allies, as part of a wide-ranging peace plan presented in talks in Turkey. Since Ukraine achieved independence in 1991, as the Soviet Union collapsed, it has gradually veered towards the West - both the EU and Nato. Russia's leader has sought to reverse that, seeing the fall of the Soviet Union as the ""disintegration of historical Russia"". He has claimed Russians and Ukrainians are one people and denied Ukraine its long history: ""Ukraine never had stable traditions of genuine statehood,"" he asserted. It was his pressure on Ukraine's pro-Russian leader, Viktor Yanukovych, not to sign a deal with the European Union in 2013 that led to protests that ultimately ousted the Ukrainian president in February 2014.  Russia then seized Ukraine's southern region of Crimea and triggered a separatist rebellion in the east and a war that claimed 14,000 lives. As he prepared to invade in February, he tore up an unfulfilled 2015 Minsk peace deal and accused Nato of threatening ""our historic future as a nation"", claiming without foundation that Nato countries wanted to bring war to Crimea. Before Ukraine presented its plans, Russia said it was considering a ""neutral, demilitarised"" Ukraine with its own army and navy, along the lines of Austria or Sweden, which are both EU members. Austria is neutral, while Sweden is non-aligned. President Zelensky had already declared that Ukrainians now understood they would will not be admitted to Nato: ""It's a truth and it must be recognised."" Under Ukraine's Istanbul peace proposals: Ukraine would become a ""non-bloc (or non-aligned) and non-nuclear"" state, with no foreign military bases or contingents on its territoryStrict, legally binding guarantees would require countries such as the UK, China, the USA, Turkey, France, Canada, Italy, Poland and Israel to protect a neutral Ukraine in the event of attackWithin three days guarantor states would have to hold consultations and come to Ukraine's defenceUkraine would be allowed to join the European UnionUkraine would not enter military-political alliances and any international exercises would require consent of guarantor states. Ukraine's bid to join Nato (and the EU) is enshrined in its 2019 constitution, so any change would require a referendum some months later.  Under Ukraine's plan, the future status of Crimea, seized by Russia in 2014, would be decided during 15 years of consultations. And during that time there would be no military action to resolve the issue. As part of the peace proposals, all Russian troops would leave Ukrainian territory and the future of the eastern areas held by Russian-backed separatists would be discussed by the two presidents as part of a ceasefire summit. Russia has yet to respond to the proposals and says there is still a long way to go, although it sees the Ukrainian offer as a ""step towards us"".  President Putin will come under pressure not to abandon any territorial gains made during the war, especially as the declared aim is ""liberating"" Ukraine's east. Kyiv, meanwhile, will never agree to ceding its sovereign territory. While Russia's call for Ukraine's demilitarisation appears to have been dealt with, two other demands may have fallen away altogether: that of ""de-Nazification"", and having Russian recognised as a second language in Ukraine. Russia's claims of Nazism are unfounded, and Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has said bluntly: ""It's crazy, sometimes not even they can explain what they are referring to."" Ukraine's president has said he is prepared to give Russian minority language status, along with the languages of other neighbouring countries, and does not see this as a major issue. For Russia's leader the West's 30-member defensive military alliance has one aim - to split society in Russia and ultimately destroy it. Ahead of the war, he demanded that Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and reverse its eastward expansion, removing its forces and military infrastructure from member states that joined the alliance from 1997 and not deploying ""strike weapons near Russia's borders"". That means Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics. In President Putin's eyes, the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand ""not an inch to the east"", but did so anyway.  That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev only referred to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany. Mr Gorbachev said later that ""the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed"" at the time. If he has, his military setbacks in Ukraine may have put paid to any wider ambitions beyond Ukraine.  After hours of conversations with Russia's authoritarian leader, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz concluded: ""Putin wants to build a Russian empire... He wants to fundamentally redefine the status quo within Europe in line with his own vision. And he has no qualms about using military force to do so.""  Tatiana Stanovaya of analysis firm RPolitik and the Carnegie Moscow Center fears a spiral in a new Cold War confrontation: ""I have very firm feelings that we should get prepared for a new ultimatum to the West which will be more militarised and aggressive than we could have imagined.""  Having witnessed Mr Putin's willingness to lay waste European cities to achieve his aims, Western leaders are now under no illusion. President Joe Biden has labelled him a war criminal and the leaders of both Germany and France see this war as a turning point in the history of Europe. Before the war, Russia demanded all US nuclear arms be barred from beyond their national territories. The US had offered to start talks on limiting short- and medium-range missiles, as well as on a new treaty on intercontinental missiles, but there is little chance of that happening for now.

He knew Nato's members would never put boots on the ground in Ukraine, but he could not have guessed the extent of the sanctions that are already having a dramatic effect on Russia's economy - and he is furious. The EU, US, UK and other Western nations have targeted Russia's economy in a variety of ways: Russia's central bank has had its assets frozen and major banks are shut out of the international SWIFT payment transfer network.The US has banned imports of Russian oil and gas; the EU aims to cut gas imports by two-thirds within a year; and the UK aims to phase out Russian oil by the end of 2022Germany has halted approval on Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, a major investment by both Russia and European companiesRussian airlines have been barred from airspace over the EU, UK, US and CanadaPersonal sanctions have been imposed on President Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and many other individuals No peace deal with Ukraine will bring these sanctions to an end, and Vladimir Putin knows that. Instead he has turned on Russians who have opposed the war. ""The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors,"" said Russia's president. More than 15,100 anti-war protesters have been detained and virtually all independent media have been silenced. There is no meaningful political opposition left as they have either fled the country, or in the case of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, jailed for years in a strict-regime penal colony."
St Patrick's Day parades: Police warning as public events return,2022-03-17T20:32:06.000Z,"Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets on the island of Ireland as St Patrick's Day events returned for the first time in three years. Parades and other festivities were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Events returned across the globe and about 400,000 people attended the parade in Dublin. Major events also took place in cities such as New York and Washington.  In Northern Ireland, there were St Patrick's Day parades in Downpatrick, County Down, and Armagh, each with special connections to Ireland's patron saint. In pictures: St Patrick's Day events return The city's council has been hosting a series of events this year from 10-20 March, including the Beat Carnival Parade which passed through the city centre on Thursday. After promising the city would ""come alive with colour and performances"", Belfast Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl said ""it means so much to have St Patrick's Day back"". During the event on Thursday, she told BBC News NI people had deserved ""a bit of a party"" after the challenges posed by the pandemic. However, despite encouraging people to enjoy the day, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said ""unruly behaviour caused by people who celebrate to excess will not be tolerated"". NEWS: Irish PM leaves Washington dinner after positive Covid testFEATURE: America's most Irish towns celebrateVIDEO: Bartenders toast 'book-end to pandemic craziness' Ch Insp Gavin Kirkpatrick urged young people to ""stay away from the Holyland"" area of south Belfast, explaining it was a residential area and ""not a party or nightlife destination"". In previous years, there have been clashes with police and antisocial behaviour in the area, which is home to many students, around St Patrick's Day. ""We are keen to ensure that all young people are aware of the risks associated with criminal and anti-social behaviour, for their safety and future educational and career prospects,"" Ch Insp Gavin Kirkpatrick said. He added the warning was also ""to protect local residents who are feeling particularly vulnerable"" because of the day's events. As legend has it, St Patrick worked on Slemish in County Antrim when he was first brought to Ireland. And following his footsteps on Thursday, big crowds climbed to the top to mark his feast day. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council expected 1,500 trekkers throughout the day.  Bus loads took crowds from the nearby village of Broughshane where a festival took place with traditional music and dance, street theatre and an artisan market. In Londonderry, the city's spring carnival festival took place, with the council estimating a crowd of about 35,000 spectators.  The theme was based around rebirth and renewal. Earlier, members of the Apprentice Boys, one of the Protestant Loyal Orders, paraded for St Patrick's Day in the city. The march is held separately from the main St Patrick's Day parade in Derry. ""For too many years people thought it wasn't something people from the Apprentice Boys or from the Protestant tradition should be engaged in, but it is a day for everyone,"" Stephen Porter from the Apprentice Boys told BBC Radio Foyle. ""It has been a great success,"" he said. In Downpatrick, where Ireland's saint is believed to have been buried beside the town's cathedral, there was a concert in the town. Armagh City, where historians believe St Patrick established a church in 445 AD, held a community parade, with another large parade in Newry on Thursday afternoon. The St Patrick's Day parade in Dublin also made a comeback on Thursday after a break because of the pandemic. Its parade left Parnell Road at midday and crossed O'Connell Bridge on its way to a finish in Kevin Street. A special St Patrick's Day video greeting from Ireland to the world, with Paul Brady's iconic The Island song, was published to mark Ireland's solidarity and support with the people of Ukraine.  Taoiseach (Irish prime minister), MicheÃ¡l Martin, is currently in Washington, but on Wednesday night tested positive for Covid-19.  On Thursday, he held a virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden.  Northern Ireland ministers Conor Murphy and Gordon Lyons are also in Washington, as is former deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood."
Interest rates: What are they and how high could they go?,2022-03-17T12:37:30.000Z,"Interest rates have been raised from 0.5% to 0.75% - their highest level since March 2020. The Bank of England announced its decision a day after US interest rates were raised for the for the first time since 2018. Adjusting interest rates is one of the many ways the Bank tries to manage the UK economy. Sine the global financial crisis of 2008, UK interest rates have been at historically low levels. In March 2020 the rate was just 0.1%. The aim was to encourage firms and individuals to borrow or spend money - to get the economy moving. But there is a balancing act to perform. The Bank wants to encourage spending and growth, but also to make sure that this does not lead to rising prices. Raising interest rates - to encourage people and firms to borrow and spend less, or to save money - is one of the tools it uses to limit inflation. Prices are now rising quickly in the UK and around the world, as Covid restrictions ease and consumers spend more.  But many firms are having problems getting enough goods to sell. And with more buyers chasing too few goods, prices have risen.  There has also been a very sharp rise in oil and gas costs - a problem made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Many economists expect inflation to reach 7% this year, which would be its highest level since March 1992. What is the UK's inflation rate and why does it matter? Few had been expecting UK interest rates to top 1.25% this year.  But the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR) - the government's independent economic advisor -  looked at the impact of higher and more persistent inflation. This can happen if people think price rises will continue. Businesses could raise prices to keep making a profit and workers could demand wage increases to maintain living standards. The OBR has suggested that if this occurs interest rates could reach 3.5%. If interest rates rise, it can make borrowing more expensive - especially for homeowners with mortgages. Bank of England interest rates also influences the interest charged on other forms of credit, such as credit cards, bank loans and car loans.  So even if you don't have a mortgage, changes in interest rates could still affect you. Bank of England decisions also affect the interest rates people earn on their savings.  Individual banks usually pass on any interest rate rises to their savers - giving them a higher return on their money.  How the interest rate rise might affect youWhy is the cost of living going up? Interest rates are decided by a team of nine economists, the Monetary Policy Committee.  They meet eight times a year - roughly once every six weeks - to look at how the economy is performing. Their decisions are always published at 12:00 on a Thursday. Do you have a tracker mortgage and will now see your repayments rise? Are you worried that rising rates might affect your finances?

Mariupol theatre: 'We knew something terrible would happen',2022-03-17T14:22:54.000Z,"Civilians are said to be emerging alive from the ruins of a theatre that, according to Ukrainian authorities, was bombed by Russia in the city of Mariupol. Despite pictures of devastation at the scene, many who were sheltering there are thought to have survived in a basement that withstood Wednesday's attack. For 10 days, that basement was a refuge for Kate, a 38-year-old Mariupol native, and her son, who is 17. Their own home, like many others in the besieged city, had been destroyed by Russian attacks, and they thought the Donetsk Regional Theatre of Drama was a place where they would be relatively safe. Mother and son squeezed in the building's dark rooms, corridors and halls with dozens of other families. Some women, Kate said, carried babies that were just four or five months old.  ""In the beginning, it was really tough, because we didn't have a well-organised food supply. So on the first two days, adults didn't have any food,"" Kate, who used to work at the city's zoo shop and did not want to give her full name, said. ""We gave food only to the children."" They slept on improvised beds made with soft parts of auditorium seats which had been put together on the floor. The seats made of wood, she said, were cut in parts and used as firewood for them to cook. ""Around the theatre there wasn't enough trees we could use, and it was too dangerous to go outside"".  For almost three weeks, Mariupol has been under constant shelling by Russian forces, which have completely surrounded the city. About 300,000 people are trapped, with no electricity, gas or running water. Food and medicine are running low, as Russia has prevented the delivery of humanitarian aid. Four days after she arrived, Kate said, Ukrainian forces managed to send some food supplies and a field kitchen to the theatre, and ""we [started] cooking something"". They would have soup, and sometimes oatmeal, for lunch, and tea with biscuits for dinner. The imposing Soviet-era building in Mariupol's city centre, next to the Sea of Azov waterfront, had been designated as a shelter for civilians. Sergei Orlov, the city's deputy mayor, said up to 1,200 people had been there. Human Rights Watch, citing interviews with evacuees, put that number at between 500 and 800. As Russia's relentless assault continued, Kate said the buildings around the theatre had been either damaged or destroyed. ""We knew we had to run away because something terrible would happen soon,"" she said.  A day before the attack, Kate and her son left the site. ""We jumped in a car while the theatre and the area were being shelled,"" she said. They shared the vehicle with a family of four, who had brought four dogs and a cat. ""We asked to go with them, because we didn't have our own [car],"" she said. They were part of convoy of about 2,000 cars that escaped Mariupol on Tuesday.  Mariupol city council said a Russian plane dropped a bomb on the theatre, calling the attack ""deliberate and cynical"". Russia denied it had targeted the site but, in Mariupol alone, its attacks had already hit several civilian buildings including a hospital, a church and countless apartment blocks. Satellite images released by the US company Maxar taken on Monday showed that the Russian word for ""children"" had been marked on the ground in large letters in two locations outside the building, to warn Russian jets away. Video of the aftermath showed smoke billowing from the building's collapsed faÃ§ade. But with communications with the city almost completely cut off, the numbers of survivors or possible casualties were still not clear, almost 20 hours later. Dmytro Gurin, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and originally from Mariupol, said the shelter in the basement of the building withstood the attack, and that teams were trying to clear the rubble which covered the entrance to the site. ""It looks like most of them have survived and are OK,"" he said. But the rescue efforts were tricky, he said, as Russia had continued to attack the area. ""Shelling never stops and artillery never stops and airplanes are dropping bombs,"" he said, ""so it's really difficult"". The city council estimates about 80% to 90% of the city's buildings have either been damaged or destroyed by Russia, which has attacked the city almost non-stop since it invaded Ukraine, three weeks ago. Entire neighbourhoods have been turned into wasteland.  Local authorities say at least 2,400 people have been killed in Mariupol, although they acknowledge this is likely to be an underestimate. Many of the dead are being buried in mass graves. After leaving Mariupol, Kate was headed to the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, a region that has been largely spared of attacks. ""The first day after we managed to get out, I couldn't talk. We all just cried"", she said. ""But now it feels like there are no tears left. I don't think this pain will ever disappear.""

Peter Bowles: To The Manor Born actor dies aged 85,2022-03-17T12:46:36.000Z,"Actor Peter Bowles, famous for starring opposite Penelope Keith in BBC comedy series To the Manor Born, has died at the age of 85, his agent has confirmed. He also appeared in films such as The Bank Job, Eyewitness and the Steal as well as TV shows including Victoria, Magnolia Street and Only When I Laugh. The actor's agent said Bowles had ""sadly passed away from cancer"". ""He leaves his wife of over 60 years, Sue, and their three children Guy, Adam and Sasha.""  The statement continued: ""Starting his career at the Old Vic Theatre in 1956, he starred in 45 theatrical productions ending at the age of 81 in The Exorcist at the Phoenix Theatre. ""He worked consistently on stage and screen, becoming a household name on TV as the archetypal English gent in To The Manor Born, Only When I Laugh, The Bounder and Lytton's Diary, which he devised himself."" Columnist and presenter Piers Morgan said Bowles was a ""wonderful actor who exuded roguish British charm.... sad news"". Bowles was best known for his role as Richard DeVere in To The Manor Born which aired from 1979 to 1981, starring as the self-made businessman alongside Dame Penelope Keith, with the pair reprising their roles in a 2007 special. The show regularly attracted TV audiences of 20 million and became what Bowles was best known for.  He told the Daily Mail in 2018 he became something of an overnight success in his 40s after starring in the comedy, having not even been invited to the show's press launch. The paper said that the day after it screened he was ""tooted at in the street by fans driving past and, later, given a standing ovation when he walked on stage in the West End"". ""It did not go down well with the rest of the cast!"" he added. He told the Mail he was ""trained to be a leading Shakespearean actor. The voice! The presence! The size! But I never had a lead."" In about 2013 he was offered King Lear, but he explained it came too late: ""I turned it down - I was too old!'  Born in London in 1936, he grew up in Nottingham and won a scholarship to the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada). He cut his teeth on stage with the Old Vic Company before embarking on a successful TV career. Speaking about his success in sitcoms, he told the PA news agency in 2010: ""If you have a great popular TV success, particularly in comedy, people don't think you can act on stage. ""People thought I was just a sitcom actor and the BBC told me I'd never work in drama again. I didn't realise there were two worlds. It was new to me. I found it very odd and frustrating."" During the Second World War his father worked as an engineer at Rolls-Royce and when Bowles was six the family moved to one of the poorest working-class districts of Nottingham. Their house had an outside toilet and no bath. ""We were in a Coronation Street environment but everyone was extremely friendly and there were lots of kids. It was terrific,"" he said previously. After appearing in amateur plays in Nottingham, when he won his Rada scholarship, he lost his Midlands accent. He was reunited with Dame Penelope in a regional tour of Sheridan's The Rivals, directed by Sir Peter Hall, in 2010. In 2016, he starred in BBC Two series Murder, which delved into the psyches of everyone involved in a murder case through testimony delivered straight to camera by each character. He recently played the role of the Duke of Wellington alongside Jenna Coleman in the popular ITV series Victoria."
Man jailed for Aberdeen stab-in-heart knife murder,2022-03-17T11:04:20.000Z,"A man convicted of murder after stabbing a man he met on a dating app has been jailed for a minimum of 16 years. David Bain, 28, stabbed 60-year-old ScotRail worker Clifford Anderson in the heart with a knife before leaving the fatally-injured victim in his home. It happened in Aberdeen's Jasmine Terrace in August 2020. Jailing Bain for life at the High Court in Edinburgh, a judge said his actions were ""brutal and callous"". Bain had denied murder, but was convicted on a majority verdict by a jury last month. He was seen outside in the street with a can of lager shouting: ""I have stabbed him.""  The former labourer and slaughterhouse worker later told police: ""I need to stop taking drugs. That's what it is."" Man convicted of stab-in-heart knife murder The court heard that the men took part in consensual sexual activity before Bain inflicted a single stab wound to the heart of his victim. When a paramedic arrived at Mr Anderson's home, police officers were giving the victim CPR but he was in cardiac arrest and unresponsive. He was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary but was pronounced dead. Advocate depute Christopher McKenna, prosecuting, had argued that there was ""clear and compelling evidence"" to convict on the murder charge, but the defence asked the jury to return a guilty verdict to the lesser offence of culpable homicide. On Thursday, solicitor advocate Kris Gilmartin told the court that Bain had a criminal record but it was not extensive and he had never previously served a jail sentence. He said: ""He wishes to express he is truly and deeply remorseful for what took place and he has struggled to come to terms with the enormity of his actions. ""He carries the burden of causing the death of a man to whom he harbours no ill will and that is a burden he will carry for the rest of his life."" Lord Boyd of Duncansby told Bain: ""You have struggled with mental health issues and addiction for some time, as well as issues about your own sexuality. ""You say you wish to now apologise to Mr Anderson's family, but recognise they may not want this. At least you have shown some insight into the harm you have caused."" He added: ""Whether or not you will be released on bail will be a matter for the parole board."""
How the interest rate rise might affect you,2022-03-17T15:58:07.000Z,"Global uncertainty is having a direct effect on our finances in the UK, with prices rising and businesses juggling pressure from various issues. The impact of the war in Ukraine has an impact on petrol prices and the cost of everyday items. The economic uncertainty it creates is also making the Bank of England's decisions on rates trickier. The idea of raising interest rates is to keep those current and predicted price rises, measured by the rate of inflation, under control. In the face of global upheaval, this may be a relatively blunt tool. All eyes will be on the Bank's long-term strategy. For now, policymakers have increased interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5%, the third rate rise in four months. How high could UK interest rates go? Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive. For households, that could mean higher mortgage costs, although - for the vast majority of homeowners - the impact is not immediate, and some will escape it entirely. An improvement on savings rates is likely to be far outweighed by the falling value of money put away. Recent years have seen an extraordinary period of cheap mortgages but, even before the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee began increasing interest rates in December, there were signs that the era of ultra-low mortgage rates was at an end. Some lenders have raised rates for those applying for a new home loan. However, brokers have predicted any rises in mortgage rates to be ""slow and measured"", which would mean mortgages would stay cheap by historical standards for some time. It is a little-discussed fact that only about a third of adults have a mortgage. About a third rent their home, another third have either never had a mortgage or have paid it off. Those figures come from the English Housing Survey, which is geographically limited, but one of the most comprehensive guides available. Some 74% of mortgage borrowers in the UK are on fixed-rate deals, so would only see a change in their repayments when their current term ends, according to banking trade body UK Finance. About 1.5 million fixed-rate deals will expire this year, and another 1.5 million will do so in 2023. Of the remainder, 850,000 homeowners are on tracker deals, and the other 1.1 million are on standard variable rates (SVRs). They are the people likely to feel an immediate impact now the Bank rate has risen. The increase in the Bank rate to 0.75% means a typical tracker mortgage customer's monthly repayment will go up by Â£25.76. The typical SVR customer is likely to pay Â£15.96 more a month, UK Finance figures show. This is on top of similar rises in previous months. What are interest rates and why do they matter?UK prices rise at fastest rate in 10 years That means a further squeeze on household budgets at a time of rising bills and when people have been used to years of cheap borrowing and relatively slow-rising prices. Every mortgage applicant since 2014 would have needed to prove in a stress test that they can pay at a rate of about 6% or 7% - the idea being that a small rate rise may be uncomfortable, but not unmanageable, for homeowners. However, the Bank of England is planning to drop this requirement, with a consultation on the proposal closing in May. Any improvement in savings rates will have a very limited impact on the value of money tucked away, given that the spending power of these funds is being eaten away by inflation. Analysts warn that there is no guarantee of the higher Bank rate being reflected in better returns on savings.   Savers are often borrowers too, but the money in the bank has effectively been falling in value for some time.  Anna Bowes, of website Savings Champion, says it is ""really disappointing"" how slow a lot of providers have been to react to the Bank of England's base rate rises. People are receiving pennies in interest for every Â£100 they keep in savings for a year. A Bank rate rise will do little to change that scenario.  The average interest rate for an easy-access account you can open today is 0.2%, up from 0.17% in December. For easy-access accounts closed to new customers, it is 0.26%, up from 0.22%. The highest paying easy-access account has an interest rate of 0.84%, up from 0.71% in December. In the past five years, the best easy access savings rate on the market was in September 2019, which paid 1.6%. "

Ukraine conflict: Putin lays out his demands in Turkish phone call,2022-03-17T21:39:21.000Z,"Turkey has positioned itself with great care to be the go-between with Russia and Ukraine - and this seems to be paying off.  On Thursday afternoon, President Vladimir Putin rang the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and told him what Russia's precise demands were for a peace deal with Ukraine.  Within half an hour of the ending of the phone call, I interviewed Mr Erdogan's leading adviser and spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin. Mr Kalin was part of the small group of officials who had listened in on the call. The Russian demands fall into two categories.  The first four demands are, according to Mr Kalin, not too difficult for Ukraine to meet.  Chief among them is an acceptance by Ukraine that it should be neutral and should not apply to join Nato. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has already conceded this.  There are other demands in this category which mostly seem to be face-saving elements for the Russian side.  Ukraine would have to undergo a disarmament process to ensure it wasn't a threat to Russia. There would have to be protection for the Russian language in Ukraine. And there is something called de-Nazification.  This is deeply offensive to Mr Zelensky, who is himself Jewish and some of whose relatives died in the Holocaust, but the Turkish side believes it will be easy enough for Mr Zelensky to accept. Perhaps it will be enough for Ukraine to condemn all forms of neo-Nazism and promise to clamp down on them. The second category is where the difficulty will lie, and in his phone call, Mr Putin said that it would need face-to-face negotiations between him and President Zelensky before agreement could be reached on these points. Mr Zelensky has already said he's prepared to meet the Russian president and negotiate with him one-to-one.  Mr Kalin was much less specific about these issues, saying simply that they involved the status of Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, parts of which have already broken away from Ukraine and stressed their Russianness, and the status of Crimea.  Although Mr Kalin didn't go into detail, the assumption is that Russia will demand that the Ukrainian government should give up territory in eastern Ukraine. That will be deeply contentious.  The other assumption is that Russia will demand that Ukraine should formally accept that Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, does indeed now belong to Russia. If this is the case, it will be a bitter pill for Ukraine to swallow.  Nevertheless, it is a fait accompli, even though Russia has no legal right to own Crimea and actually signed an international treaty, after the fall of Communism but before Vladimir Putin came to power, accepting that Crimea was part of Ukraine.  Still, President Putin's demands are not as harsh as some people feared and they scarcely seem to be worth all the violence, bloodshed and destruction which Russia has visited on Ukraine.  Given his heavy-handed control over the Russian media, it shouldn't be too hard for him and his acolytes to present all this as a major victory. For Ukraine, though, there are going to be serious anxieties.  If the fine details of any agreement aren't sorted out with immense care, President Putin or his successors could always use them as an excuse to invade Ukraine again.  A peace deal could take a long time to sort out, even if a ceasefire stops the bloodshed in the meantime.  Ukraine has suffered appallingly over the past few weeks, and rebuilding the towns and cities which Russia has damaged and destroyed will take a long time. So will rehousing the millions of refugees who have fled their homes. What about Vladimir Putin himself? There have been suggestions that he is ill, or possibly even mentally unbalanced. Did Mr Kalin detect anything strange about him in the phone call? Not at all, he said. Mr Putin had apparently been clear and concise in everything he said. Yet even if he does manage to present an agreement with Ukraine as a glorious victory over neo-Nazism, his position at home must be weakened.  More and more people will realise that he overreached himself badly, and stories of the soldiers who have been killed or captured are already spreading fast.

Russia Today: News channel RT's UK licence revoked by Ofcom,2022-03-18T10:40:14.000Z,"Russian state-backed news channel RT has had its licence to broadcast in the UK revoked ""with immediate effect"" by media regulator Ofcom.  The watchdog said RT's parent body ANO TV Novosti was not ""fit and proper to hold a UK broadcast licence"". RT's coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been under investigation by Ofcom, and the channel had already disappeared from UK screens. RT, formerly named Russia Today, called Ofcom ""a tool of the government"". The channel became unavailable on all UK broadcast platforms earlier this month as a result of a ban imposed by the European Union. News editor interrupts Russian TV in war protestWatching the war on Russian TV - a whole different story Although the UK is no longer in the EU, the bloc applied sanctions to satellite companies in Luxembourg and France, which provided the RT feed to Sky, Freesat and Freeview.RT has also been blocked on YouTube but its website is still available in the UK. UK Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, who has described the channel as ""Putin's polluting propaganda machine"", said: ""I welcome Ofcom's decision and it's right that our independent regulator has taken action against RT.  ""The outlets' lies and propaganda, where victims are cast as the aggressors and the brutality of Russia's actions are concealed, have absolutely no place on our screens.""  RT is a state broadcaster. It is funded by and principally - its critics would argue - serves the Russian state. This is different to a public broadcaster, which is funded by and serves the public. TV Novosti, the institution that controls RT, is funded by the Kremlin. Under Ofcom rules, TV channels can be owned by foreign states, but they must not be controlled by political bodies. This is what did for CGTN, the Chinese network. Ofcom believes the clear absence of due accuracy and due impartiality on RT, and its ultimate control by a political body, violates our regulatory code. Should liberal democracies ban state propaganda? Such moves may be ineffective: RT is still available online. They may be counter-productive: Ofcom accepts retaliation against the BBC is possible. And if the West is fighting a war for liberal democracy, free speech - while not unconditional - cannot be jettisoned lightly.  Against all that must be weighed the harm of allowing lies to proliferate, and the importance of signalling control over our own public domain.  Ofcom has done its job. But what do the rest of us want that job to be? In recent weeks, Ofcom has launched 29 investigations into the ""due impartiality of RT's news and current affairs coverage"" of the invasion of Ukraine. On Friday, Ofcom said its investigation took account of factors including: RT's relationship with the Russian Federation - Ofcom said RT is funded by the Russian state, which has recently invaded a neighbouring sovereign countryNew laws in Russia which effectively criminalise any independent journalism that departs from the Russian state's own news narrative, in particular in relation to the invasion of Ukraine ""We consider that given these constraints it appears impossible for RT to comply with the due impartiality rules of our Broadcasting Code in the circumstances,"" Ofcom's statement added. Chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said: ""Freedom of expression is something we guard fiercely in this country, and the bar for action on broadcasters is rightly set very high."" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter RT deputy editor-in-chief Anna Belkina said Ofcom had ""robbed the UK public of access to information"". ""What we have witnessed over the last few days,  be it comments from the President of the EU Commission or from PM Boris Johnson, is that none of them had pointed to a single grain of evidence that what RT has reported over these days, and continues to report, is not true.  ""Instead, what they have said is that what RT brings to its audience is not allowed in their supposedly free media environment. When it comes to the Russian voice, or just a different perspective from theirs, it is simply not allowed to exist."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday that the country's media regulator had been asked to review RT's presence on Canadian airwaves, saying it was ""a move consistent with what many allies are doing, they banned it""."
P&O Ferries staff protest over shock firing,2022-03-18T15:44:44.000Z,"P&O Ferries staff are staging protests after the firm sacked 800 employees without giving them any notice. The RMT and Nautilus unions are calling for action across the ports of Dover, Liverpool, Hull and Larne. Nearly a quarter of P&O Ferries' staff were told via a video message on Thursday that it was their ""final day of employment"". P&O said it took the ""difficult decision"" as a ""last resort"" to save the business. But unions have hit out against the dismissal, saying it marked a ""dark day"" in the shipping industry. A chorus of cross-party MPs described P&O Ferries' actions as ""callous"" and ""disgraceful"". The government is looking ""very closely"" at the action P&O Ferries has taken to see if they broke any laws after it fired its employees, planning to replace them with cheaper agency staff, it said. P&O Ferries sparks outrage by sacking 800 workersProtesters turn out in force against P&O sackings The RMT union labelled the move one of the ""most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations"".  Its national secretary Darren Procter told a crowd of about 250 demonstrators in Dover: ""We're going to make sure our workers get back onboard their vessels.""  P&O Ferries worker Andrew Smith said he felt ""utter dismay"" after working for the company for 22 years. ""It's our lives,"" he said. ""It's how our families have grown up, knowing that this is what we do, and it's just been turned on its head within a matter of hours."" Mark Dickinson, general secretary of the maritime trade union Nautilus, told the BBC: ""It's absolutely ripped the guts out of everybody."" ""I've seen some curveballs and some shocking developments over that time... but for a company to treat the legal process in such an underhand and callous way has shocked me."" Both the RMT union and Nautilus International are seeking legal advice on the dismissal. The transport union TSSA called on the government to ""take over running vital ferry routes to safeguard trade and travel"", and ""hit [P&O] where it hurts"" over the ""shocking events"". Holly Cudbill, an employment lawyer from Blake Morgan, said that P&O Ferries' actions ""were almost certainly illegal"". Although its boats sail around the world, she believes the firm's employees are covered by UK law. In that instance, P&O Ferries should have consulted with unions and staff about potential dismissals and notified the government that hundreds of jobs were at risk, she told the BBC. Sacked staff said the video message had referred to a ""generous severance package"" being offered, but no details were given. Maritime minister Robert Courts said he was ""frankly angry at the way workers have been treated"". He told the House of Commons P&O Ferries' actions were ""wholly unacceptable"". ""Reports of workers being given zero notice and escorted off their ships with immediate effect while being told cheaper alternatives would take up their roles, shows the insensitive nature by which P&O approached this issue,"" he said. He added that he did not expect critical goods and services to be hit by the sudden drop in capacity, but travellers ""should expect some disruption over the coming days"". The company has said services are unable to run over the next few days. In a letter to the prime minister, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh described the firing as a ""despicable assault on workers' rights"". ""But British seafarers do not need meaningless platitudes - they need action,"" she added, demanding that government suspends any contracts it holds with DP World - P&O Ferries' owner. Former transport minister Sir John Hayes also suggested the government should ""recover any monies granted to P&O during the pandemic"" in a bid to reverse their decision. P&O Ferries claimed almost Â£15m in government grants in 2020, which included furlough payments for its employees. The move was also condemned by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Dover in a joint statement, which described the sackings as ""inhumane and unethical"".  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter ""Ill-treating workers is not just business. In God's eyes it is sin,"" they said, calling for support for a consultation. P&O Ferries acknowledged on Friday that the redundancy came ""without warning or prior consultation, and we fully understand that this has caused distress for them and their families."" They added: ""We took this difficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn't survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies."" P&O Ferries is one of the UK's leading ferry companies, carrying more than 10 million passengers a year before the pandemic and about 15% of all freight cargo in and out of the UK. It was bought by DP World, the multi-national ports and logistics company based in Dubai in 2019. At the time of purchase, its chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem described it as a ""strong, recognisable brand"". It paid a Â£270m dividend to shareholders in 2020. However, like many transport operators, it saw demand slump in the pandemic. Just a couple of months after the dividends announcement, it said it would cut 1,100 jobs after a downturn in bookings. On Friday, it confirmed it is losing about Â£1m a day for each day its services are not running. Are you affected by issues covered in this story? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Covid travel restrictions have ended in the UK,2022-03-18T04:53:13.000Z,"All remaining Covid travel restrictions have now been lifted for passengers entering the UK.  As of 04:00 GMT, unvaccinated arrivals will no longer have to take tests - the rule had already been lifted for the vaccinated - and passenger locator forms have been scrapped. It comes almost exactly two years after the first Covid lockdown measures were imposed in the UK. Travel bosses said lifting the rules was the ""final game-changer"". Aviation minister Robert Courts said: ""Everything we have worked for - every jab, every test, and the sacrifices made by the whole country means that finally, nearly two years on, we can all travel without bureaucratic restrictions."" The government said the change had been deliberately timed before the Easter holidays, but added that contingency plans had been drawn up to respond to any future Covid variants.  Derek Jones, chief executive of Kuoni, a tourism company, said bookings had surged in recent months. ""The removal of all travel restrictions is the final game-changer - people can now go on holiday or visit family and friends overseas without all of the stress that comes with testing before they return home,"" he said. ""Finally, we've seen the back of the unpopular and ineffective passenger locator forms, which were always a hassle to complete. Travel has been in turmoil for two years but now it's back."" However, UK travellers are still advised to check the rules for the countries they are visiting - as many still have restrictions and testing requirements in place. What are the UK's 'Living with Covid' plans?'Chaotic' scenes as queues lead to missed flightsAirline giant Delta warns ticket prices will rise The removal of the rules marks the end of a rapidly-changing - and often complex - set of Covid rules for people arriving in the UK. People were first advised against all non-essential international travel in March 2020.  Later that year, passenger locator forms for arrivals were introduced, along with ""travel corridors"" - with people arriving from countries outside the corridors having to self-isolate at home for up to 14 days. Other rules have included pre-departure and post-arrival tests; hotel quarantine for some arrivals; and a ""traffic light"" system of red, amber, and green countries. The traffic light system could often cause short-term changes to people's plans as countries moved from one colour to another. In a further complication, all four nations could set their own rules - meaning there were sometimes different restrictions in different parts of the UK. More recently, changes have been agreed by all governments in the UK."
Ukraine: Elegant Odesa is transformed by efforts to deter Russians,2022-03-17T23:52:30.000Z,"While Russian advances across Ukraine have slowed in recent days, people in the strategic port city of Odesa are preparing for an expected and imminent Russian attack. Decision-time is fast approaching in Odesa. As Russian warships circle off the coast, air-raid sirens wail over the cobbled streets, and Russian ground forces seek to advance west along the shores of the Black Sea, civilians in this historic, famously cosmopolitan port city are facing the same hard and urgent choices that millions of other Ukrainians have already confronted. Some residents have left Odesa, heading west towards the nearby border with Moldova or taking a crowded train north to Lviv. The city's elegant boulevards, with their cafes, trams, and theatres, now stand mostly empty and littered with tank traps, while protective sandbags crowd around some of the most famous monuments. But like many Odesans, Valentin Kartashova is staying put - for now. She runs a state orphanage, looking after 90 children, including both newborns and 18 others with severe disabilities.  ""These children are dependent on oxygen, on respiratory support to keep them alive. I've had many offers of help from abroad. But they want to meet us at the border. I can't take these children by train or car. How can I move them from here? Must I leave them? Must I abandon them? And only take the healthy ones?"" asks Kartashova, shaking her head. She's prepared a cellar in the orphanage compound, with supplies to last a week or more, and has decided the children will be safer staying in Odesa, unless they come under direct fire. A few miles closer to the city centre, Olga Pavlova has also reached a similar decision. ""I'm afraid - and not only me. I think other people are just as afraid of the situation. But we'll stay here. We love our city and we'll stay. I've become a volunteer. Who else will feed the animals?"" says Pavlova, a veterinarian scientist who works at Odesa's municipal zoo. Hundreds of families have already left pets at the zoo before fleeing, but almost all the staff have decided to remain at work. ""We've decided it is better to stay put. The animals are our responsibility. We'll win this war soon, I believe. People will return and we need to make sure the zoo is still here, and the theatres, the libraries. We need to guard all that - to protect our culture,"" says the zoo's director, Igor Beliakov. He explains that some of the more nervous animals - a 43-year-old African elephant known as Daisy, several bears, and zebras - are being kept inside in case the sound of explosions makes them panic. Playing their regular game of chess in a park near the city's Russian Orthodox cathedral, in sub-zero temperatures, two ethnic Russian pensioners, Alexander Nikrasov and Nikolai Ivanov, describe the invasion as ""worse than the Nazis"", who occupied Odesa during World War Two. ""At least the Germans didn't destroy the city when they left Odesa, but now there's every chance it will be destroyed,"" says Ivanov. ""Mykolaiv [a city under Russian attack, to the east] is already suffering for defending us. Of course, the war will come here. People are dying in their thousands and for what? Because Putin wants to take something from us?"" asks Nikrasov, brandishing a walking stick which he calls, ""my only weapon."" Speaking by phone from Italy, one of Odesa's most renowned Russian-speaking poets, Boris Khersonsky, says he is ""not a refugee"", but left the city a few days earlier after receiving a literary invitation. ""It's a really difficult decision. What do you have to keep you in Odesa? What is waiting for you abroad?"" says Khersonsky, adding that he plans to return imminently, assuming the city remains under Ukrainian control. ""If the city is under Putin's rule, I won't return. If Putin succeeds in capturing Mykolaiv then he has a straight path to Odesa. It's always been a volatile city with a big cultural heritage. Over the years, many writers - who are the glory of Odesa - have left. Odesa can give birth to talent, but very often it doesn't take care of it,"" he says. As in so much of Ukraine, many people are volunteering to join the local defence forces. ""I love my country. I want to live in a free country. Russian is my language, but now Russia is the enemy. Maybe it's a surprise, but maybe it was expected,"" says Ruslan Prihodka, who usually works in a chemist, but is now learning to assemble an AK47 in a classroom near the city centre. ""I don't know how to fight yet. But we'll have to do our best. Maybe there's something wrong in Putin's head,"" says Dima, a construction worker, standing nearby. During one air raid, volunteers working at a food-collection centre near the city's grand old opera house rushed to the basement, where a local singer brought out a guitar to play Ukrainian folk songs. ""Having watched how Russian forces have already destroyed other historic towns like Kharkiv, I have no hope that our Russian heritage will spare us from their bombs,"" says Alexei Kostrzhitski, an IT expert now serving as a captain in a local defence group. ""Mariupol and Kharkiv are very pro-Russian cities,"" adds a young city councillor, Petro Obukhov. ""Most citizens here speak in Russian not Ukrainian. And still Putin bombs them. It makes no sense but still I hope he will not bomb us.""

Burger King Russia partner 'refuses' to shut shops,2022-03-21T00:13:36.000Z,"The owner of Burger King said the operator of its 800 stores in Russia has ""refused"" to close the sites despite demands to suspend trading.   Restaurant Brands said it had contacted local partner, Alexander Kolobov, to shut the shops amid the war in Ukraine. But it said ""complicated"" contracts with overseas partners mean it is unable to ""walk away"" from these deals. Mr Kolobov told the BBC he does not have the ""authority or power"" to stop Burger King operations in Russia.  But he said any closure must be approved by all investors in the business.  ""The decision to terminate and suspend operations of the franchisee which employs about 25,000 persons must be taken by all shareholders considering impact it may have on the employees and their families,"" he said. Many Western firms have shut or suspended their Russian businesses because of the country's invasion of Ukraine. However a small number, including Burger King and UK retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S), have been unable to do so because their stores are run by franchise partners under ""complex"" legal arrangements. The Western brands unable to leave RussiaGrowing numbers of firms pull back from Russia In a letter to staff, Restaurant Brands International president David Shear said: ""We contacted the main operator of the business and demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia. ""He has refused to do so."" Mr Shear added that making any changes to its local Burger King business ""would ultimately require the support of Russian authorities on the ground and we know that will not practically happen anytime soon"".  Burger King entered the Russian market 10 years ago. It trades there through a joint venture partnership with Mr Kolobov - who is the main day-to-day operator of the business - as well as with Russia's VTB Capital and a Ukrainian investment firm. VTB Capital is an affiliate of VTB Bank, Russia's second largest financial institution which has been sanctioned by the US, UK and other European countries. Mr Kolobov said he owns a 30% stake in the joint venture.""Since the date of the establishment (of) the joint venture-franchisee... my share has always been far below control,"" he said.  Mr Shear said Restaurant Brands owns a minority stake of 15% in the Russian joint venture which it is in the process of unwinding. ""While we would like to do this immediately, it is clear that it will take some time to do so based on the terms of our existing joint venture agreement,"" he said.  Restaurant Brands has stopped supporting the supply chain, operations and marketing for Russia. It will also reject new pitches for investment and expansion in Russia. Western companies remain under pressure to withdraw from Russia following its attack on Ukraine. On Thursday, a group of four Ukrainian MPs highlighted to UK prime minister Boris Johnson that M&S is still open in Russia.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter MP Alona Shkrum said: ""It is very important to put Putin in isolation and for him to know he will not be getting a handshake from the world, he will not be getting a handshake from business, there will be no support for him because he has killed children in Ukraine."" Complex franchise agreements have prevented some Western brands from shutting their stores in Russia. They have, however, publicly shunned the country over its invasion of Ukraine.  Marks & Spencer stores are operated by a Turkish company called FiBA, which has held the rights to sell the retailer's products across Eastern Europe, since 1999.  M&S said it has suspended shipments of its goods to FiBA which runs Marks' 48 stores in Russia.  Meanwhile, German carmaker Audi has warned that the war in Ukraine will cause ""tremendous interference"" to supply chains.  ""We will see tremendous interference with all the supply chains, not just the chip business, but any supply chains internationally,"" said Audi executive Hildegard Wortmann."
Covid: Travel restrictions end and is the world ready for great reopening?,2022-03-18T07:49:26.000Z,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. All remaining Covid travel restrictions have been lifted for passengers entering the UK. As of 04:00 GMT, unvaccinated arrivals no longer have to take tests - the rule had already been lifted for the vaccinated - and passenger locator forms have been scrapped. However, Britons travelling abroad are still advised to check local rules at their destination. It's a little over two years since the UK entered its first coronavirus lockdown, in the days after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. With restrictions being lifted in many countries, even as some countries experience record case numbers, our correspondents around the globe offer a snapshot of how Covid is currently affecting life. When the Chinese city of Shenzhen went into a six-day lockdown on Sunday, after a massive surge in Covid cases, it sent shockwaves through the world's businesses. Roughly half of all China's online retail exporters are based there, so if you're buying something online there's a very good chance it was made in the city. But, as Asia business correspondent Mariko Oi hears, British businesses have found ways to minimise the impact. After a report highlighted ""increased numbers of children with eating disorders and anxiety"" as a result of the pandemic, we hear from schools in Suffolk about the effects on pupils and their social skills. ""Lots of children have struggled with school, and behaviour for some children can be really difficult,"" says head teacher April Grimes. There might be one or two sore heads around this morning, after mass St Patrick's Day events returned from a two-year absence caused by the pandemic.

"Child, 13, drove pickup in deadly Texas crash that killed nine",2022-03-17T22:12:05.000Z,"A 13-year-old was behind the wheel of a pickup truck that slammed head on into a van carrying university athletes in a collision that killed nine on Tuesday.  In a Thursday news conference, federal investigators said the truck's left tyre - which was a spare - blew out before swerving into the oncoming van. Six university golfers, including one from Portugal and one from Mexico, and their coach died in the crash.  Both the young pickup driver and his passenger were also killed.  Two students, both from Canada, survived the collision and are in a stable condition but still in hospital.  Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt Victor TaylorÂ told the Associated Press news agency that it would be illegal for a 13-year-old to be driving in the state. Children are allowed to begin classroom driving lessons at the age of 14 in Texas, and must be 15 before they can start driving with an instructor or licensed adult in the car.  Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said in Thursday's news conference that it's still unclear how fast the vehicles were moving when they collided head-on on a two-lane highway near the New Mexico border, causing both vehicles to burst into flames.  Several of the victims in the van were not wearing seatbelts, the NTSB said, adding that one passenger was ejected from the vehicle. The information is preliminary, officials added, and the investigation into the ""mass casualty event"" is expected to last several more months.  The victims from the University of the Southwest - a private university in New Mexico - include golf coach Tyler James, 26; Jackson Zinn, 22; Karisa Raines, 21; Travis Garcia; 19; Laci Stone, 18, as well as Portuguese national Tiago Sousa, 18; and Mexican citizen Mauricio Sanchez, 19. Henrich Siemens, 38. was named as the pickup truck passenger. The name of the boy driving the vehicle is not being released due to his age.  The accident occurred in Andrews County in west Texas on Tuesday night, just after 20:00 local time (01:00 GMT). A Ford Transit passenger van was carrying members of the both men's and women's golf teams from a golf tournament, authorities said. The other vehicle involved was a Dodge 2500 pickup truck. The Ford had been travelling northbound on the FM1788 roadway in Texas, while the Dodge pickup was travelling southbound. The two surviving golfers are undergoing medical treatment in Lubbock, Texas.  Their families have arrived from Canada to be with them, a university official said on Thursday, adding that one is doing well enough to be able to sit up and eat soup. "
Young brothers found in Amazon after nearly four weeks,2022-03-18T00:28:41.000Z,"Two young indigenous boys rescued after almost four weeks lost in Brazil's Amazon rainforest have been found and taken to hospital. Glauco and Gleison Ferreira, eight and six, got lost trying to catch small birds in the jungle near ManicorÃ©, Amazonas state, on 18 February. A local tree cutter found them by chance on Tuesday. They are expected to make a full recovery after being treated in hospital for malnourishment. After the boys disappeared, hundreds of residents spent weeks looking for them. But lost during the rainy season of the Amazon - a time which makes walking and moving in the jungle even more difficult than usual - they were nowhere to be found. Emergency services decided to call off the search on 24 February, but locals continued to search for the boys, according to local media outlet AmazÃ´nia Real. Almost four weeks later, the boys were found by a man cutting wood 6 km (3.7 miles) from the village of Palmeira in the Lago CapanÃ£ protected land reserve where the boys live with their parents, AmazÃ´nia Real adds. One of the boys shouted for help when he heard the local man hitting the trees nearby. Following the calls, the man found the two boys lying on the rainforest floor, hungry and weak, with many skin abrasions. According to local media, the two boys told their parents they had eaten nothing while lost and had had only rainwater to drink. Upon their discovery, Glauco and Gleison were sent to a regional hospital in ManicorÃ©, before being transported by helicopter to another hospital in Manaus on Thursday morning, Globo reports. This is not the first time people have got lost in the Amazon rainforest. In January last year, pilot Antonio Sena spent 36 days lost in one of the remotest parts of the Brazilian Amazon after his aircraft crashed. In 2008, AmazÃ´nia Real reports an indigenous 18-year-old was lost for 50 days in a remote area of the Amazon after going hunting, and died shortly after he was found."
Dozens of pilot whales die at notorious New Zealand beach,2022-03-18T04:40:13.000Z,"At least 31 pilot whales have died after a mass stranding at a New Zealand beach known to be a notorious spot for whale deaths. Wildlife officials said the pod was first spotted on Thursday, beached across three kilometres of Farewell Spit on the South Island. On Friday, rescuers managed to refloat five whales who had survived the night. But just hours later, at least two had washed back up and had to be euthanised, officials told the BBC. This beaching is just the latest in mass strandings at Farewell Spit, the northernmost tip of New Zealand's South Island. Authorities say while whale strandings are unfortunate, they are a natural phenomenon.  Why do we see so many whales washing up?Nearly 100 whales die in New Zealand stranding ""It's not an uncommon experience here in Golden Bay, given the area's topography... it's known as one of the stranding hotspots,"" rescuer Dave Winterburn from the Department of Conservation told the BBC. ""So we go through periods when we don't have any, and then we get a couple in a row - that's just the way things go."" It is not fully understood why the whales got stranded, but pilot whales are known to be more prone to getting beached. They are not considered endangered, although exact population numbers are not known. Farewell Spit, a 26km (16 mile) hook of sand that protrudes into the sea, has been a frequent site of strandings, although scientists are unclear why.  One theory is that the spit creates a shallow seabed in the bay with extensive, kilometres-wide sand flats.  This can confuse whales' sonar navigation systems.  But Mr Winterbottom said there weren't any plans to put in protections for whales in the area, as the vast landmass made solutions like a water barrier ""completely impractical"". Last year, rescuers were able to save 28 long-finned pilot whales of a pod of about 50 who had stranded on the beach, but the rest died. The worst stranding occurred in February 2017, when almost 700 whales beached, resulting in 250 deaths. The area has seen at least 11 pilot whale strandings in the past 15 years.

Girls face more pressure to be a perfect teenager,2022-03-18T00:03:27.000Z,"Teenage girls sleep and exercise less than boys, and are three times as likely to report struggling with their mental health, a study suggests.  Those are among findings drawn from the experiences of almost 40,000 teenagers across Greater Manchester. Young people worked with academics to devise a questionnaire for the BeeWell research project. It is thought to be the largest attempt to analyse young people's wellbeing in one region, and runs for three years. Huge leap in children in mental health crisisSocial media damages teenagers' mental health, report says Saint, one of the Year 10 pupils who responded, wasn't surprised the first results reveal some marked differences between the experiences of girls and boys.  Girls were three times as likely - at 22% - to report serious emotional difficulties, as boys at 7%.  Saint, who wants to be a scientist, dropped out of football because she had had enough of feeling unwelcome as the only girl.  She said: ""I think a lot of it today is about looking good for other people, being who other people expect you to be - the perfect girl. Especially today when lots of people are questioning who they are, and their identity."" She said there was pressure to construct a life that looks busy, even if you don't have people you can talk to properly in reality. Social media use was higher among girls, an average of 4.8 hours a day, and 46% reported not getting enough sleep.  The teenagers I spoke to said social media could be a source of support, but also added to the pressures on girls around body image. Across the city, Ruby, another Year 10 pupil, said confidence was an issue. ""I think it's clear, it is more in women to struggle more. In my opinion boys can be cocky with the things they know and it puts other people down."" So do boys feel they have more freedom?  Two Year 8 boys told me they thought that was true, not least in sport because the choice for boys is wider.  Saad said he thought boys had much more leeway to be ""mischievous"" and mess around. Overall a third of the teenagers reported being active for an hour a day, including just walking, but for girls that fell to just 26%. Researchers think it's also possible there is less space for boys to express vulnerability.  Ahmed, who doesn't really use social media, said: ""As boys we express our emotions less, we're expected to be stoic."" The research will be analysed to show the differences in wellbeing between different neighbourhoods across the city region.  That could be revealing in the contrast between wealthier and more deprived areas, but also the many different communities in a big urban area.  A year 8 pupil Maria told me she was allowed to go to friends and to the shops on her own, but many other girls aren't.  Lara Tang's mental health care packages help young peopleChildren's mental health has not improved since lockdown - survey The generational shift in issues around identity and gender are also apparent in the study, with 2.7% identifying as gay or lesbian and a further 7.7% as bi or pansexual.  Saint said: ""I don't think it really surprises me at all. As celebrities, for example, have decided who they are, it's become easier for young people to look at the people they admire and think it's OK to express myself. ""It's more common now for people to ask themselves who they think they are at a younger age."" The findings in this research suggest teenagers identifying as gay or lesbian are twice as likely to be bullied in some way.  Ahmed said: ""If you're LGBT you might be harassed. I think identity plays a really big part in society."" Prof Neil Humphrey, from the University of Manchester, said what made BeeWell different was the involvement of 150 teenagers in designing the research questions.  Insights have already been fed back in confidence to all the secondary schools which took part to inform their welfare policies.  A breakdown of the data by neighbourhoods will be used to select some for further pilot projects in which young people will have a budget to direct on improving local wellbeing.  ""We are about immediate impact and insights into the lives of young people,"" he said."
What weapons will US give Ukraine - and how much will they help?,2022-03-18T00:54:02.000Z,"The burnt-up wreckage of a Russian tank lies in the dirt, while in an accompanying photo next to it, a Ukrainian soldier carries the armaments said to have caused the destruction. The images posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian Armed Forces are labelled with a triumphant caption, declaring that this was the result of ""hits from Javelins on [Russian] military equipment"". The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, can be controlled by a portable unit that doesn't look much different from a video game console - but can send a metre-long projectile straight through the side or top of an armoured tank. The very presence of the American-made weapons ""causes panic"" among Russian troops, the Ukrainian military claims - and it is about to get 2,000 more of them.  Javelin missiles are among the items promised to Ukraine by the US in a new $800m (Â£608.3m) military assistance package announced by President Joe Biden on Wednesday. Other armaments include drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky.  But will these shipments help Ukraine overcome Russia's more numerous - and better equipped - invasion force?  The new US aid for Ukraine includes a wide range of military equipment, ranging from 25,000 sets each of body armour and helmets to rifles and grenade launchers, thousands of other anti-tank weapons and more than 20m rounds of ammunition. Besides Javelin missiles, the most powerful weapons include 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, once famously used to shoot down Soviet planes in Afghanistan. The US also plans to ship 100 ""tactical unmanned aerial systems"" - small drones - which are often hand-launched and small enough to fit into rucksacks. Soldiers can use them to scope out the battlefield or, in some cases, to attack, essentially creating flying bombs that can be flown into targets from a distance. Mr Biden's announcement on Wednesday brings the total amount of US military aid pledged for Ukraine to $1bn in the past week alone - a huge acceleration when compared to the $2.7bn provided between 2014 and the start of 2022. It is a ""significant development"" and addresses previous shortfalls, according to John Herbst, a former US ambassador in Kyiv. ""There's no question that [Biden] and his team have been too timid in providing support for Ukraine,"" Mr Herbst said. ""And they have responded to that pressure.""   Military experts say that the US-supplied anti-tank weapons are likely to have the most impact in Ukraine. The invading Russian forces ""are primarily mechanised forces"" - meaning armoured convoys - so ""the best thing you can do is take them [vehicles] out"", said former US Army Colonel Christopher Mayer. Ukraine has received a variety of anti-tank systems from several countries, which helps increase the ""lethality"" of Ukraine's forces against Russian vehicles, Mr Mayer said.                   ""If you give them a variety of anti-tank systems, it provides them with multiple opportunities to punch through whatever particular defensive armour protection systems that tank has,"" he said.   And while their claims can't be independently verified, Ukrainian officials say they are putting the weapons to good effect. As of 16 March, they claim to have destroyed more than 400 tanks and over 2,000 other Russian vehicles. Anti-tank weapons, however, do nothing to help Ukraine combat Russia's air force, which for three weeks has been striking targets across the country. The man-portable, shoulder-fired Stinger system is the only anti-aircraft weapon included in the US aid package. The system has been seen in conflicts around the world since 1981. It was most famously used in Afghanistan, where US-supplied Stingers helped bring down hundreds of Russian aircraft and helicopters during the Soviet occupation. It is effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft at up to about 3,800m (12,400ft), making it relatively useless against higher-flying Russian bombers. Mr Herbst said that the administration's mention of Stingers as part of the aid package to Ukraine is a ""sign of weakness"".   ""They do need more Stingers, there's no doubt about that,"" he said. ""But they need higher altitude anti-aircraft weapons as wellâ¦that's a serious omission."" While the White House has hinted that higher-altitude weapons - such as the Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile - might be headed to Ukraine via third countries, no formal announcement has been made.  Officials in Slovakia have expressed a willingness to send the systems to Ukraine, provided they receive replacements. Two other Nato allies - Greece and Bulgaria - also reportedly have the systems.  The US has also dismissed proposals to have Poland transfer its Mig-29 fighter jets to Ukraine to allow them to do more to contest the skies. US officials have described the plan as not ""tenable"" due to the increased risk of open conflict between Nato and Russia. Mr Mayer, however, said that the transfer of Mig-29 or similar jets by US allies - with the administration's blessing - would be an effective way of helping Ukraine fight for control of its skies.   He noted that the Soviet Union provided both aircraft and pilots to North Vietnam to operate against US aircraft without starting a wider confrontation.   The US isn't alone in providing military aid to Ukraine. At least 30 other countries have provided help, including â¬500m ($551m) from the European Union, a historic first.  After the US announced the new assistance package, however, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that ""more support"" was urgently needed.  ""Even more than we get now,"" he said, calling for ""air defence systems, aircraft [and] enough lethal weapons and ammunition to stop the Russian occupiers"".  Mr Mayer said he believes that the US weapon supplies pledged to date are perhaps only enough to allow the Ukrainians to ""die heroically"". ""We must be more aggressive about giving them what we have,"" he said. ""We should at least give them the same quality, and quantity, of stuff as the Soviet Union gave to North Vietnam during our war with them.""   Mr Herbst said that additional assistance packages will ""probably"" be needed in the future - and that they'll only be effective if they allow Ukraine to challenge Russia's air force.   ""The key to me is whether or not we're sending something that hits Russian air assets at 30,000 feet or above,"" he said. While no firm announcements have been made thus far, President Biden vowed that more help will be on the way - and that the US is working to help Ukraine acquire the longer-range air defence systems it needs, without providing details.  ""More will be coming,"" he has said. "
Ukraine conflict round-up: Putin's peace demands and a new 'Russian wall',2022-03-17T22:00:48.000Z,"Could a peace deal be taking shape that will end Russia's invasion of Ukraine? It might sound strange to say so, given fighting has entered its fourth week. Yet the outline of such a deal is emerging. In a phone call between Russia's President Vladimir Putin and the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Russian leader set out his demands.  Mr Erdogan's chief adviser, Ibrahiml Kalin, listened in to the call and told our World Affairs editor John Simpson what had been said. Rescue workers have been searching the ruins of a theatre bombed by Russia in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Despite pictures of devastation at the scene, hundreds of civilians who were sheltering there are thought to have survived in a basement that withstood Wednesday's bombing. ""We knew we had to run away because something terrible would happen soon,"" said Kate, a 38-year-old who left the building with her son just a day before the building was bombed.  Read Hugo Bachega and Orysia Khimiak's report here. Meanwhile, Russian forces have made gains across the south of Ukraine, pushing east and west from Crimea. Troops are attempting to encircle and cut off the capital, Kyiv, but large areas around the city remain under Ukrainian control, especially in the south. We've been tracking Russia's invasion with maps.  When Western officials gave their assessments of Russia's plans, before the war began three weeks ago, they predicted a lightning campaign with a rapid assault on Kyiv at its heart. With every day since, that assessment has changed, with officials now saying the Russian military is bogged down, making only minimal gains and suffering dreadful casualties.  They no longer exclude the possibility that Ukrainian forces, who they praise as fierce and mobile, will fight the Russians to a standstill. They say Russian morale is extremely low and that the Russian air force, which they expected to dominate the skies, continues to move with extreme caution to avoid Ukrainian air defences.  Of course, Ukraine's military is suffering too, and Western officials are acutely conscious that Vladimir Putin could, as one put it, ""double down with greater brutality"". But not only is the war not going the way it was planned, they say - even the recent shift to a slower, more grinding form of warfare is stalling as well. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told German MPs that a new type of Berlin Wall was being built, dividing Europe between freedom and oppression. He thanked Germany for its support during Russia's invasion. But it was uncomfortable listening for many MPs, as he criticised German energy policy and business interests for contributing to that wall of division. The BBC's Damien McGuinness in Berlin has this analysis of the Ukrainian leader's speech and its impact. Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, who interrupted a live Russian news broadcast holding an anti-war sign, said her interrogators could not believe her decision to protest about the war in Ukraine was her own decision. Ovsyannikova said she needed to break free from being a ""cog in the Russian propaganda machine"". She spoke to the BBC's Caroline Davies.  Two UK ministers have revealed they have been targeted with hoax calls linked to the conflict in Ukraine. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace blamed Russian ""dirty tricks"" after revealing a man had called him earlier pretending to be Ukraine's prime minister. He became suspicious and ended the call after the ""imposter"" posed ""several misleading questions"", he said. Home Secretary Priti Patel then tweeted that she had received a similar call earlier this week. The Ministry of Defence said Mr Wallace had ordered an immediate inquiry into how the prankster was able to call him.

Ukraine's restaurants rally to the war effort,2022-03-18T00:22:46.000Z,"Kyiv restaurant the Milk Bar used to charge Â£12 a meal, now it's producing 500 meals a day for free to help feed the citizens of the Ukrainian capital.  The restaurant has not been able to pay its staff since February but it still has 20 people working there. ""We are all just thinking about people and the community right now,"" bakery owner Anna Kozachenko said. Hers is just one of the food businesses stepping up to support Ukrainians following the invasion by Russia.  ""I'm not even thinking about the financial losses,"" said Ms Kozachenko. The staff who have stayed with the firm are now working around the clock to deliver meals to the elderly and refugees from invaded areas outside Kyiv. Large food suppliers have provided food to the restaurant for free and have promised to do so for ""as long as it is needed"". The landlord has also suspended rent for the restaurant. The Milk Bar is one of more than 450 restaurants that have transformed their businesses to help feed anyone who needs it following Russia's invasion of Ukraine - people sheltering in bunkers, the elderly unable to leave their home, and those fighting on the front lines. One larger firm, LaFamiglia Group, which has 14 restaurants, a catering business and 17 food markets, has also now switched to providing shelters, food and medical supplies.  The business, which made tens of millions in dollars in sales last year, is now providing more than 8,000 snacks and sandwiches and more than 5,000 hot meals each day for free.    Owner Mikhail Beylin told the BBC suppliers were providing lots of food for free and the rest was being sold at cost, with them not making a profit from it. The restaurant is using its own money to cover any additional costs. Mr Beylin said the war had made getting food to and from the restaurant ""complicated"" and there are fears that they could run out of supplies. ""Now the supply we get is enough to cover the demand and create a small back-up of products in case we face a scarcity,"" he added.   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter ""Our chefs remain in the middle of military zones to provide our people with food.""  ""It's not the time to worry about finances, profits and margins, now is the time for actions that are required of everyone in order to stop further destruction of lives.""  Pizzeria owner Ruslan Buriak has 60 volunteers working around the clock at his kitchens in the central-eastern city of Dnipro, which was first targeted by Russian air strikes last week.  The kitchens are producing about 1,000 meals each day for the local population and has been relying on free pasta, oils and meat from local farmers. Like the Milk Bar, Mr Buriak also makes deliveries to elderly people and those unable to leave their homes.  ""We have around one week of stock left and the volunteer chefs need money to get buses to work,"" Mr Buriak explained.  ""We're like a family now and everyone is doing their best to help."" One of Ukraine's biggest food producers MHP, which grows and distributes wheat, is helping restaurants to keep going and feed people during the conflict, including Mr Beylin's chain. It employs more than 30,000 workers across Ukraine.  It has delivered food to isolated communities across the country, but the invasion means some parts of Ukraine where it would normally sow wheat are now inaccessible. ""If this continues, of course our ability to sow rapidly diminishes, particularly if they (the Russian army) moves into the west of the country where a large part of our operations are based"", MHP boss Dr John Rich told the BBC. This would have an impact which reaches far beyond Ukraine. Some 30% of the world's wheat comes from Ukraine and Russia. The majority of Ukraine's wheat and corn exports went to the Middle East or Africa last year - and disruptions to supply could affect availability in these areas. If grain production is hampered, analysts have warned supplies may struggle to keep up with demand, meaning wheat prices could rise across the globe. In the meantime, the government is doing what it can to help financially. It has restarted support schemes put in place to help restaurants cope with the Covid pandemic. Dr Tymofii Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, expects the government to take a larger role in supporting the country's firms as they switch from making sales and profit to trying to help the country's people survive the war. ""Many restaurants have now run out of money but the government is providing relief and co-ordinating people's demand as we continue into a war economy,"" Dr Mylovanov said. Meanwhile MHP has also appealed for donations to its charitable foundation so it can continue to distribute food. Back in Dnipro, Mr Buriak's landlord has also halted rent, water and electricity bills to help support the pizzeria and people are continuing to volunteer their time for free.  Mr Buriak plans to keep feeding Dnipro for as long as stocks remain.  ""We will keep going until the end of this situation but no one knows how long this will take."" "
Marina Ovsyannikova: Protesting journalist says Russians zombified by propaganda,2022-03-17T14:24:55.000Z,"A Russian journalist who interrupted a live TV news programme to protest against the war in Ukraine says Russians are ""zombified"" by propaganda. Speaking to the BBC, Marina Ovsyannikova said Russians should stop listening to state media coverage. ""I understand it's very hard... to find alternative information, but you need to try to look for it,"" she said.  Ms Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel 1, was detained after her protest on Monday. She ran onto the set of one of Russia's most-watched news programmes, Vremya, holding a sign reading: ""No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here."" She could also be heard repeating the words ""no war, stop the war"".  ""I was aware that if I went to protest in [Moscow's] central square I would be arrested like everyone else and thrown into a police van and be put on trial,"" Ms Ovsyannikova said on Thursday. ""Half the poster was in Russian, half the poster was in English. I really wanted to show the Western audience that some Russians are against war,"" she said. ""I feel of course some responsibility lying on me. I was an ordinary cog in the propaganda machine. Until the very last moment I didn't think about it too much,"" she said. Ms Ovsyannikova also responded to various allegations in Russian media about her motivation for staging the protest. ""There are lots of conspiracy theories building up about me,"" she said. ""That's why I had to explain to the world what really happened, the fact that I am just a normal Russian woman, but I could not remain on the sidelines.""

The journalist said she was detained and questioned by police for 14 hours, and fined 30,000 roubles ($280; Â£210) for the video. The authorities had been convinced she had been acting on someone else's behalf, she said. ""Nobody believed it was my personal decision. They suggested it could be conflict at work, relatives who were angry about Ukraine or that I was doing it for Western special services."" ""They couldn't believe that I had so many objections to the government that I could not stay silent,"" she said. Russian state television news has long been controlled by the Kremlin and independent viewpoints are rare on all the major channels.  It is also unusual for employees of state-controlled news organisations to express an opinion that differs from the official Kremlin position.  But since the war in Ukraine began, a number of journalists have resigned from top Russian TV channels: Zhanna Agalakova from Channel 1, and Lilia Gildeyeva and Vadim Glusker from NTV.  State-controlled Russian media refer to the war as a ""special military operation"" and paint Ukraine as the aggressor, describing Ukraine's elected government as neo-Nazis. "
Newspaper headlines: P&O sacks crew and 'Putin's Kyiv assault in doubt',2022-03-18T00:39:16.000Z,"Leading many of today's papers is the move by ferry operator P&O on Thursday to sack 800 of its workers and replace them with cheaper agency staff.  The Financial Times reports the company sent security teams to clear crew members from its ships and that no notice period had been given.  Its front page also features an image of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meeting a girl who was hospitalised while fleeing a Russian assault on the town of Vorzel. The Sun's front page labels P&O a ""bunch of anchors"". The paper describes the ""furious backlash"" that followed the sackings and quotes a spokesman for the prime minister calling the dismissals ""wholly unacceptable"". ""Mutiny on P&O ferries,"" reads the headline in the Metro.  The front page reports that many of the company's staff refused to leave their vessels after being told of their dismissal.  It also carries a quote from Mr Zelensky, who on Thursday told German leaders: ""Tear down this wall!""  In an address to Germany's parliament, Mr Zelensky said Russia was trying to build a new type of Berlin Wall to divide Europe between freedom and oppression. The Mail also dubs events at UK ports on Thursday ""mutiny on the P&O ferries"".  The paper reports that some of the security personnel sent in to remove crew from ships were wearing balaclavas and carrying handcuffs. P&O is described as being ""up ship creek"" on the front page of The Star.  The paper also reports on the death of British actor Peter Bowles, best known for starring in 1980s sitcom To The Manor Born, aged 85. The Express says P&O's behaviour on Thursday was a ""betrayal"".  The front page reports that one ship's captain, Dutchman Eugene Favier, locked his ship down to stop workers being escorted off.  The page also features a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who landed back in the UK early on Thursday after being released from detention in Iran, posing for a selfie with husband Richard Ratcliffe and seven-year-old daughter Gabriella. The same selfie of Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe and family takes up much of the front page of the Guardian.  The paper also reports that six countries - the UK, US, France, Albania, Ireland, and Norway - have requested an urgent meeting of the UN Secrity Council to discuss alleged war crimes in Ukraine.  It quotes UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss as saying there was ""very, very strong evidence"" of war crimes by Russian forces. The i reports that Vladimir Putin may be forced to abandon plans to send troops into Ukrainian capital Kyiv in favour of aerial bombardment.  The paper says Western intelligence believes Russian advances have stalled due to fierce resistance and supply problems. Russia's military setbacks are also the subject of the front page of The Times.  The paper reports that the country's forces are being held off around Kyiv and second city Kharkiv and have had to summon troops from other deployments. The Mirror has an exclusive report on a group of mothers who have been carrying out missions to rescue children from Kyiv.  The women, who it dubs the ""band of mothers"", have reportedly rescued 227 children so far. And The Telegraph reports on an alleged attempt by Russian imposters to pose as Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal in a video call with UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.  It says that Home Secretary Priti Patel was also targeted and that the calls appeared to be part of an operation to extract sensitive information and embarrass the UK government.

"P&O Ferries: 'We've been abandoned by the company', say sacked staff",2022-03-17T21:44:28.000Z,"Seafaring staff at P&O Ferries were told by video message that 800 of them were being sacked immediately as their ships returned to port. The decision has sparked angry protests from staff on ship and shore. Darren Proctor, national secretary for the RMT union, says he woke up to a flurry of messages from people worried about what the company was about to announce. Heading down to Dover, he was told that coaches with private security guards were travelling to the P&O port on the south coast of England, as well as Hull, Larne and Cairnryan. ""They had to be handcuff-trained,"" he says. Then at 11:10 GMT, their worst fears were confirmed: 800 staff were told they were immediately redundant. Mr Proctor says some staff remain on the three ships at Dover, but some have left and security staff have boarded to try and put their replacements in post. P&O Ferries sacks 800 but crew refuse to leave ships'No one can get on or off the ship until we get guarantees'P&O job losses devastating blow for Dover, MP saysP&O ships 'unable to operate' at Larne for week James, a steward on board the Spirit of France ferry at Dover, was on a day off when he heard the redundancy announcement.  He was texted half an hour before the three-minute video from P&O management. ""It feels like we have been abandoned by the company, only a few days ago they were ordering new uniforms and giving us all a pay rise and now, completely out the blue, they have sacked us,"" he said.  James, who did not want to give his surname, said staff were told that they would be given a ""generous severance package"" in the video message but staff were not able to ask questions after the call and no details about redundancy pay were given.   ""How they expect to run an entire fleet of ships with fresh, inexperienced crew I will never know - it won't be smooth sailing,"" he says. Mark Canet-Baldwin from Hull says he was hired a week ago to work as onboard services manager on a new ship sailing in British waters, but the agency couldn't tell him anything about the ship. He was put up in a hotel in Glasgow and then driven at 05:30 GMT to an undisclosed location, which turned out to be the P&O dock at Cairnryan. Their bus stopped to pick up a security detail of a dozen guards, ""all in black, big handcuffs on the back of them"", Mark says. When they arrived, some agency staff knew the P&O workers as former colleagues and got in touch. ""People on board were just devastated,"" Mark says. ""It was just horrible, we were appalled, there was just a general feeling of uneasiness on the bus and we felt we were like traitors to the cause or something."" One sacked P&O staff member had just taken out a mortgage, he says, and they had all been expecting to arrive home for two weeks of leave, not redundancy. ""I've got kids and I started thinking about them. In this day and age you've got to have morals, you've got to have ethics,"" Mark says. He says he took off his hard hat and overalls and, along with three others, got off the bus and went home. On board the Pride of Hull, staff stayed put after the shock announcement. Gaz Jackson, an RMT officer who boarded the ship in Hull's King George Dock early on Thursday, said cheaper replacement staff were parked outside the port waiting to get on board, while another van held what he believed were security staff. He said the captain made a ""brave decision"" to lift the gangway for the crew's safety, saying security guards were going to ""pull us off if we weren't going to get off"". The protest meant other workers with no connection to the P&O dispute had also been trapped on the ship. Keith Davis had been repairing some kitchen equipment with eight other contractors when the captain lifted the gangway. ""We're being held against our will,"" he said. Later on Thursday afternoon, the stern doors of the Pride of Hull were seen to open and a few vehicles came off, however. The P&O Ferries crew told the BBC they intended to stay on board for ""as long as it takes"". But after a stand-off lasting for several hours, the crew eventually disembarked at around 16:30 GMT. Mr Jackson said they ended their protest after the company agreed to provide paperwork requested by the union. ""The crew are absolutely devastated. I've seen grown men crying on there because they don't know where they're going to go from today,"" he said. In Larne, one man who had worked for P&O Ferries for nine years said security staff came on board their ship to make sure everyone left. He said: ""We went through a lot over the last two years with the pandemic and all that kind of stuff, but didn't think it would end like this."" Dozens of workers also blocked roads at Dover in protest, with some clashing with motorists as they stood in the road with banners and flags saying: ""Stop the P&O Jobs carve-up"". Some insisted they would not move until the police came to take them away. One 54-year-old man, who has worked in ferry engine rooms since the 1980s, told the PA news agency: ""I'm fuming, to be honest with you. I've known people who've been with the firm for years - this is no way to treat people. ""It was just a short message this morning saying you've all lost a job, basically - all this service for nothing."" The protesting members of staff want P&O Ferries to begin talks with them over their jobs, but the RMT national secretary Mr Proctor says: ""This is a company that doesn't want to negotiate at all, there's been no dialogue with them whatsoever and they've obviously been organising this for a long time."" Asked if it was true, as the company suggested, that P&O management had no choice, he said it had been financially mismanaged for years. ""They've chosen to go for the jugular of UK seafaring,"" he says. Now staff want support from MPs and government and they are trying to drum up international backing from workers in foreign ports.  ""If they can do it here, they can do it at another site and that can't be allowed to happen,"" says Mr Proctor.

"Michael Collins: Lock of Irish leader's hair sells for Â£18,000",2022-03-17T15:02:57.000Z,"A lock of hair belonging to Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins has sold at auction for twice as much as a gun he used during a jail break.  Collins was the leader of the new Irish government and also the chief of its national army when he was killed during the Irish Civil War in 1922. The lock of his hair, attached to a keepsake card, sold for Â£18,000 plus fees, according to Bloomfield Auctions. A gun he used to break Ãamon de Valera out of Lincoln Prison fetched Â£9,000. Collins was said to have been in possession of the Smith and Wesson revolver when he helped fellow republican leader de Valera escape from the English prison in 1919. Both lots were among a number of historical artefacts linked to Collins which went under the hammer in east Belfast on Wednesday, just months before the centenary of his death. The sale attracted international interest, according to the auction firm's managing director Karl Bennett, who took queries from collectors in the United States and Australia as well as from the UK and Ireland.  ""From an auctioneer's point of view, who has a very keen interest in history, it's good that pieces of history like this are bought and appreciated, and hopefully do go out on display, so stories can be told about our history and are not forgotten about,"" he said.  Although the buyers' identities have not been revealed, he told BBC News NI that both items were expected to return to the Republic of Ireland. He understands that the gun is going into a private collection and he is hoping to hear within the next few days if the lock of hair will go to a museum or into a private collection.  So what is the background to the lock of hair? Michael Collins was 31 years old and engaged to be married to Kitty Kiernan when he was shot dead in an ambush in his native County Cork in August 1922. A cutting of his hair was reportedly taken as a memento after his death, and came into the possession of senior Irish soldier Felix Cronin, the man who would eventually marry Kitty Kiernan. According to the auctioneer, Mr Cronin gave the lock of hair to an unnamed colleague who passed it down his own family to the most recent owner, whose identity has not been disclosed.  Collins was shot in the head near the village of BÃ©al na BlÃ¡th in Cork less than two months into the Irish Civil War. He was ambushed by rival republicans who opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty - the peace deal Collins had signed up to with the British government the year before. A reluctant Collins had been sent to London in October 1921 to negotiate the deal by de Valera, the then president of the republican movement. De Valera, a future taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and president, broke out of Lincoln Prison using a replica key which had been baked into a cake and smuggled into the jail.  Collins was waiting outside Lincoln Prison for his then superior and the weapon he was holding reached Â£9,000 in the auction. Also sold on Wednesday was a collection of documents from Collins' friend and comrade Emmet Dalton, who was with him when he was killed. The documents, which include Dalton's emotional eyewitness account of Collins' assassination, sold for just under Â£10,000. However, a walking stick believed to have been used by Collins did not sell after it failed to meet its reserve price. Michael Collins' diaries donated to Irish stateMichael Collins' walking stick sells for Â£52,000Michael Collins' slippers spark Twitter storm Born on a farm in rural County Cork in 1890, Collins grew up to be one of the most prominent figures in the Irish revolution, which led to the partition of the island in 1921. He moved from Cork to London as a teenager and worked for the British Civil Service as a postal clerk, but he returned to Ireland almost a decade later and took part in the 1916 Easter Rising. That brief rebellion against British rule was crushed, but two years later Sinn FÃ©in won a landslide election victory and set up a new breakaway government in Dublin.  Collins, by that stage an elected MP, became both a minister in the provisional government and director of intelligence for the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Following the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), a reluctant Collins was sent to London by de Valera to negotiate a peace deal. The controversial 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty created an independent Irish Free State, but it angered many republicans as it appeared to copper fasten Britain's recent partition of Ireland. Timeline: The major events that led to partitionRead more about major figures of that era. The treaty caused a bitter split in the republican movement and within months, tensions boiled over into the Irish Civil War. Collins became commander-in-chief of the Free State's new National Army as well as chairman (leader) of the provisional government. His tenure in charge was short-lived however, as he was assassinated by anti-treaty forces in his native County Cork on 22 August, 1922."
Covid-19: Is the world ready for a great reopening?,2022-03-17T21:45:14.000Z,"Two years after the US went into its first lockdown, the country is getting nearer to a pre-pandemic existence. But what about the rest of the world? When California issued a statewide stay-at-home order on 19 March 2020, most people thought that life would return to normal relatively quickly. A full 24 months later, people are finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, with restrictions being eased in the US and several other countries.  But with some places experiencing record numbers of cases yet again, it's clear that the pandemic isn't ready to let go its grip just yet.  We asked our correspondents in the UK, Hong Kong, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Peru and the US to give us a snapshot. Nick Triggle, London England's last remaining Covid restriction - the legal requirement to isolate after a positive test - was lifted at the end of February. It came a month after the government lifted the requirement to wear masks in places such as shops and on public transport and the advice to work from home where possible. But the truth is England has had a pretty light-touch approach to regulations compared to many places since the summer. The masks mandate and working from home advice was only reintroduced in late 2021 as the Omicron variant took off. What are the UK's Living with Covid plans? The approach is based on the fact that vaccines are providing great protection and England has seen very good uptake among those groups most at risk - 95% of over-60s have had a booster jab. It has meant that despite the surge in infections caused by the Omicron variant, the number of people dying has been similar to what would normally be seen during a normal winter. There are signs infections may be starting to climb again, but it is causing little concern at the moment. Pumza Fihlani, Johannesburg  South Africa is largely back in business. The government lifted most lockdown restrictions last December, which brought an end to a night-time curfew for the first time in nearly two years, as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol (South Africa was one of a few countries to ban alcohol sales at the height of the pandemic in 2020).  Today across the country's main cities and towns, life has returned to normal with the hubbub of people commuting to work and play in full swing. There is one unmissable indicator that Covid is still with us, however, the mandatory mask wearing in all public places - which is followed by most people. With reason, because cases are once more decreasing according to official figures, following a fourth wave which hit the country a few months ago driven by the omicron variant.  Most schools have reopened but there are discussions about introducing vaccine mandates at tertiary institutions, which is proving a contentious issue. And what does socialising look like? Nightclubs are still closed to the public, but people can now be out until late at bars and taverns without worrying about being arrested for violating curfew. Was South Africa ignored over mild Omicron evidence? Simon Atkinson, Sydney For almost two years, my friend across the Tasman in Wellington has been very blasÃ© about this pandemic. Then, this week, came a raspy WhatsApp voice message. ""We've all got bloody Covid! It has gone nuts."" Her family is far from alone. While tough lockdowns and virtual isolation helped the country get a reputation as a Covid success story, now transmission rates have soared. And many Kiwis are struggling to grasp how their country has gone from fewer than 1,000 cases a day to more than 20,000 cases in just a couple of weeks.  It's not that long since Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was still valiantly pursuing a strategy of elimination. Some comfort amid that psychological shock is that there have been fewer than 120 Covid deaths during the entire pandemic, largely thanks to 95% vaccination rates in the eligible population. Most restrictions have now been eased, and isolation requirements for Covid patients are being reduced. But mandates, meaning unvaccinated people in some sectors lost their jobs, led to three weeks of protests in the capital Wellington and remain in place. Double-jabbed New Zealanders are now able to come home from overseas without quarantine or isolation requirements - a huge deal given borders were shut for almost two years. Travellers from 60 other countries, including the US and UK, will get the same treatment from 2 May - with a negative test. Grace Tsoi, Hong Kong The Omicron variant has been a rude awakening for Hong Kong.  The city follows mainland China's ""Zero Covid' strategy, which involves stringent border control, aggressive contact tracing and strict quarantine rules, and managed to keep the virus at bay for the first two years of the pandemic. By the end of 2021, only about 12,000 cases were recorded.  Today, it has the world's highest death rate, with most of the victims being unvaccinated elderly. More than half a million have caught the virus.  The virus is still spreading, even though harsh social distancing measures have been in place. Restaurants cannot offer dine-in service after 18:00, and venues such as gyms and bars have been shut since January.  What went wrong with Hong Kong's Covid plan?Businesses shut as China widens Covid lockdowns People are angry and confused by the handling of the crisis. Quoting government sources, local media reported on a possible citywide lockdown accompanied by compulsory testing for 7.4 million residents. Such news has sent people into panic, and shelves have been emptied in supermarkets. However, city leader Carrie Lam said this week universal testing was no longer a top priority.  This devastating wave will eventually end. Most will either have acquired natural immunity after infection, or been vaccinated. But one can't help asking if Hong Kong will still need to stick to the ""Zero Covid"" strategy when local businesses are struggling and international talents are fleeing the city? Katy Watson, Sao Paulo Peru was one of the quickest - and toughest - places to impose lockdown. Strict curfews were brought in, not even dog owners could exercise their pets at the start of the pandemic, such was the policing of quarantine.  But that didn't stop Peru being hit badly and hospitals being overrun. In short, the necessity for people to carry on working in this poor country - added to the fact that the underfunded public health service wasn't prepared enough - meant the death-toll soared. But fast-forward two years and something that felt so all-consuming seems to be part of everyday life now - restrictions are easing and infections are falling. There are of course reminders of the pandemic - masks are still being worn and many places ask for proof of vaccines before people are allowed to enter.   That said, Peruvians are probably more preoccupied with the country's political crisis than health at the moment. The country's President Pedro Castillo is now on his fourth cabinet in seven months. His predecessor, Martin Vizcarra, who led the country through the initial lockdown, was impeached in 2020.  Between health and politics, it's been a tumultuous few years in Peru. The drama of Peru's Covid orphans Robin Levinson King, Toronto The spring will bring a thaw to more than just an icy winter in Canada, as Covid restrictions across the country are eased. With most of the Covid rules falling under provincial, not federal guidelines, the rollout has been staggered, but it is near universal. Every province or territory that had a vaccine passport - often required to access indoor services such as restaurants - will drop them by April, with proof of vaccine still required for some professions such as long-term care workers. Mask mandates are also falling by the wayside, including in schools. Federally, air and rail travel still require masks and proof of vaccination and even people who are fully vaccinated must test upon entering the country, at least for now. However, the government has started to ease up on testing requirements for Canadian citizens.  These decisions come after a weeks-long anti-Covid restriction protest that held the national capital hostage and blockaded one of Canada's most important trade routes. While the decision to ease restrictions not been officially attributed to the demonstrators, some may view the rapid changes as a concession, or a victory. For most of the pandemic, the country followed strict protocols, with restaurants and gyms shut down in several cities for months on end and, when they did reopen, they issued vaccine passports.  Some in the country wish it had stayed that way. While polls suggest the majority of Canadians want restrictions to end, some individual businesses are choosing to still require proof of vaccines and masks, which means that for some, the pandemic is far from over. Tara McKelvey, Washington, DC At Georgetown University in Washington, N95 masks, once a valuable commodity, sit in boxes unused, a sign of how Covid restrictions have changed in the city and across the US. Currently, the rules allow people to live their lives almost as before. Of course, the restrictions vary, depending upon where a person lives, but the general picture is one of freedom.  Texas and Florida, two Republican states, have few, if any, mask requirements. Even Democratic-majority states, places that once had strict mask rules, have dropped the requirements, going further than the White House guidelines that were in place at the time. New York and New Jersey, for example, have ditched their indoor mask mandates. These policies reflect a greater confidence about the pandemic. While the US leads the world in total Covid deaths per population, nationwide, new cases have dropped to 36,000 a day, down from a staggering 800,000. The number of individuals admitted to hospital is also down by 75%. As a result, the mood is relatively upbeat, says Silicia Lomax, who works for a health-policy consulting firm in Washington, with people returning to ordinary life.

Based on an idea that hundreds of diseases could be diagnosed with just a few drops of blood, her venture had begun to attract interest, and investment. So as the company grew, Holmes, still in her mid-20s, brought in a man that she already knew. Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani was someone who understood how to run a successful start-up. She'd reportedly first met him during a college trip to Beijing when she was 18. He was a 37-year-old South Asian immigrant who had made millions selling his software company before the dot-com bubble burst. Around the same time he met Holmes, he divorced his wife, a Japanese artist. And at some point, the relationship became a romantic one. While Holmes was the face of the company, Mr Balwani was the businessman serving as the president and chief operating officer. In January, when Holmes was found guilty of defrauding investors in one of the biggest fraud trials in Silicon Valley history, she pointed the finger to Mr Balwani, accusing him of abuse and coercive control - something he vehemently denies.  Now, it's his turn to face the same charges of fraud, with opening arguments likely to begin as early as Friday. At one point Theranos was a $10bn (Â£7.6bn) company. It was destined for success. It had technology that promised to revolutionise diagnostics - or so Holmes claimed.  We now know those claims were fantasy science - the game-changing tech simply didn't exist.  Mr Balwani and Holmes had seemed to complement each other at the company. Former employees have described how they would play good cop, bad cop, with Mr Balwani usually playing the latter.  Holmes was the visionary. She was persuasive and engaging. People who knew her, especially those who invested in Theranos, found her knowledge of diagnostics impressive.  Mr Balwani was different. He had no knowledge of diagnostics; his background wasn't in science. He's described by people who know him as gruff, no-nonsense. And his management style is documented in emails to his employees. ""He comes across as a very tough boss,"" Reed Kathrein, a lawyer who represented investors after they lost money in Theranos, told BBC. As part of a civil case, Kathrein read thousands of emails that Mr Balwani had written during his time at Theranos.  ""You can see why he was successful in the first place. He was a bully. He was into everything and he controlled everything."" Those emails could be a major problem for Mr Balwani's defence, said Kathrein. The BBC has not read these emails. As Theranos grew, it became increasingly clear to many inside the company that something wasn't right, and questions were being raised about the 'revolutionary' technology Holmes was promising. However, whistleblowers have said previously that expensive and aggressive lawyers were used to try to prevent employees from speaking out. But it's not just employees that Theranos' leaders trained their lawyers on. John Ioannidis, a Stanford professor who investigated some of Theranos' claims, wrote a paper in 2015 questioning the efficacy of the company's technology. Soon after, he says he was contacted by Theranos' head legal counsel. ""They were not very happy. At some point they asked me if I would be willing to write an editorial with Elizabeth Holmes, kind of saying that I was wrong,"" he said. He refused. Elizabeth Holmes: From tech star to convicted fraudsterSilicon Valley's trial of the century Ioannidis hopes Mr Balwani's trial will shed more light on the inner workings of Theranos' management. ""It's very hard to say what happened internally. Obviously releasing that information would be very insightful."" Holmes was found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud against investors and three charges of wire fraud. Mr Balwani faces similar charges in the trial that's expected to last three months. Mr Balwani's defence is likely to focus on similar arguments that Holmes' lawyers made. For one, they will likely argue that he sank his own money into the project. Why would he do such a thing in a fraudulent venture?  Mr Balwani's lawyers have seen what worked for Holmes and what didn't during her trial only months ago. Equally, the prosecution has also had a dry run, getting a feel for how the jury reacted to different arguments. Both sides are coming into court with a better idea of what to expect. What we don't yet know is what Mr Balwani will say about Holmes and to what extent his lawyers will argue that the fault lies with her. And his defence will have to include a rebuttal of abuse charges she levelled against him in testimony she gave in her own trial. Theranos has captured the imagination of Hollywood - Mr Balwani is a central character in Hulu's recently released TV series, The Dropout - and there's also a major film about Theranos in production. For many, Mr Balwani's role in the scandal has already been told. However, his conviction is not a certainty.  Holmes was not found guilty on all the charges against her; fraud cases are notoriously difficult to prosecute. Mr Balwani's lawyer has previously said that he committed no crimes, and did not defraud investors.  Holmes will be sentenced after Sunny Balwani's verdict. She faces a possible 20-year sentence. Mr Balwani's trial won't be as high profile, but the stakes are just as high. James Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

China lockdowns: The economic cost of a zero-Covid policy,2022-03-18T03:16:07.000Z,"War. Inflation. And now, Covid lockdown deja vu in China. It is a perfect storm for the global supply chain - how goods and materials get from other countries to you and me. When disruptions take place in China, it is significant because about a third of the world's entire manufacturing capacity is based in the country.  If you're buying something online there's a very good chance it was made in Shenzhen - a city of 17.5 million in the south east where roughly half of all China's online retail exporters are based. So, when Shenzhen went into a six-day lockdown on Sunday after a massive surge in Covid cases, it sent shockwaves through the world's businesses. The restrictions have since widened to other major cities and provinces like Shanghai, Jilin and Guangzhou. Factories had to suspend production, and cities turned into ghost towns.   The number of ships waiting at some Chinese ports has already increased, according to project44 which monitors how freight is moving across the world. ""We saw a 28.5% increase in the number of vessels waiting outside of the port of Yantian which is a major export port to Europe and North America,"" says Adam Compain, senior vice president of project44. Yantian is the same port which was shut down due to Covid last year, causing major delivery delays over Christmas. The new measures come at a time when manufacturing output from China was just starting to recover after the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays in February. While China's Covid measures are drastic, however, at least most lockdowns don't last too long. ""It's a double- edged sword,"" says Steven Lynch, managing director at British Chamber of Commerce China. ""China comes down very quickly which causes huge disruptions but then, things will go back to normal relatively quickly."" Companies also seem to be much better prepared this time. ""We've seen these lockdowns before so companies have put in a robust supply chain management,"" Mr Lynch explains. For example, e-commerce giant Amazon bought more China-based inventory to buffer any potential disruptions during earlier Omicron surges so it doesn't anticipate a significant disruption from the latest measures. ""We are able to counter these closures by diverting available freight to our neighbouring warehouses in the region,"" an  Amazon spokesperson told the BBC. Another example is Foxconn which makes iPhones for Apple. It has tried to shift production to other manufacturing sites while resuming production by asking employees to work in a closed loop system - or bubble - on its campus where people live and work. ""For Foxconn, it is probably easier,"" says Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China. ""But for many of those producers, they have to rely on the shipment of other parts, mostly within the same region so it's really hard to move because the transportation within China can also be disrupted."" The situation has put renewed spotlight on China's zero-Covid - or virus elimination - strategy.  On Thursday, President Xi Jinping said the country would stick to its policy but in a meeting of the country's top leaders, he also emphasised that pandemic measures should not cause economic pain. If China continues with its zero or close-to-zero Covid strategy, it may be China's economy and the global consumers it supplies, who will feel the real pain.  There are signs that it is enacting longer term costs, making some companies re-think their positions in the Chinese market. Alvin Ea, chief executive of Singapore's largest container haulage platform, Haulio, believes that the industry has become a lot more resilient, by looking at options other than China. ""A lot of the players have already diversified some of their resources and their plans, not to put all their eggs in one basket,"" he says. ""From a south east Asia standpoint, what we could see potentially is that some of the Vietnamese, Malaysian and Indonesian factories could see an increase in orders."" Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta agrees. ""Companies' contingency plans include anything from growing their stocks of inventories to setting up production facilities in neighbouring countries, or potentially the more expensive option to bring some manufacturing back close to where their main customers are,"" he says. Michael Hart of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, says a number of its members have been thinking about moving operations, although these are still are very much a minority.  ""But of those who've been thinking of moving operations, 22% cited Covid-related restriction last year, and that was up from 5%, the previous year."""
Climate change: Why weather changes worry Wales' 'wettest town',2022-03-18T14:13:49.000Z,"Appropriately enough, it's drizzling on the day we visit the town billed as Wales' wettest. A grey sky blends in with the towering slate mounds which surround Blaenau Ffestiniog, whose quarries once ""roofed the world"" and helped it earn Unesco World Heritage status. Situated among mountains in the heart of Snowdonia, the area's reputation as one of the wettest places in the UK is also considered a badge of honour. Residents even hosted a Festival of Rain for a few years. They are now being asked to work together to decide on ways of adapting to the challenges posed by climate change. In the largest project of its kind so far in Wales, five climate assemblies are being set up across Gwynedd in north-west Wales to involve local communities in the push towards a greener future. One of the first to sign up during a door-knocking recruitment drive was Amy Karamian, holding her young daughter Anri. She runs a vegetable box delivery scheme and said climate change was a pressing concern for someone working with farmers. Everyday actions that can help save the planetSimple guide to climate changeSeven ways to curb climate change  ""It's just constant seasonal updates from growers who are being affected by storms, drought, rain - a kind of constant cascade affecting the crops,"" Amy said on her doorstep. She feels it is important for the community to look at providing more growing space and teach people the skills to cultivate their own fruit and vegetables in case access to food becomes ""more and more limited"" long term. As Amy talked, builders were at work on a house nearby which had its roof blown off by Storm Eunice, one of three to hit the UK in quick succession in February. The impact of wetter, wilder weather on the town's ageing, stone-built housing stock is something that worries community councillor Rory Francis. ""We have (among) the highest rainfall levels of any town in Wales and England so it's difficult to keep houses both warm and dry,"" he said, with damp and poor insulation particular problems. But Rory said it is worth remembering how fortunate residents are to have such a beautiful local environment - ""during lockdowns I could be out walking in the countryside, through tree-clad gorges every day - while my son was stuck in a tiny flat (in the city)"". He said the town council had recently declared a climate and nature emergency, and had ""high hopes"" the new climate assembly would help them develop environmental policies. Luke Mason joined a number of young people to sign up as organisers recruited people along the high street as the 19 year old said it is ""worrying how much change is happening to our planet - it's on a massive scale"". He would like to see better public transport to encourage people out of their cars because his hometown ""is a bit isolated if you don't drive"". Sophie Lewis was another 19 year old to sign up as she would like to see more parks created and activities for teenagers. The apprentice chef also hoped there would be a focus on helping people with the cost of living - ""electricity and gas are going really high, it's getting hard to pay my rent"". It was a point we heard repeatedly outside the offices of Cwmni Cymunedol Bro Ffestiniog, which brings together a number of social enterprises. ""We call it a parasol, rather than an umbrella, organisation, because it's always so sunny here,"" joked development officer Ceri Cunnington. One of the projects offers a drop in service for people needing advice with issues such as saving energy and finding work. Ceri said he's just been talking to somebody in tears as their monthly gas bill is set to rise from around Â£60 to over Â£200 in April. ""How are people meant to live like that?"" he asked. EXPLAINED: Why are energy bills so high?WARNING: UK faces biggest income squeeze in decadesAPPEAL: Campaigner says families need urgent help He sees the climate assembly idea as a way of trying to bring about social justice in a place which suffers from some of the highest levels of fuel poverty in Wales and yet has huge potential for generating green energy. ""Water comes flowing down the mountains and hydro power plants in this area create 133% of our electricity needs,"" he claimed. ""All of that resource is being sucked away. It's a scandal. But coming together with a collective voice we can get to grips with some of these issues."" Traditionally, climate assemblies have tended to result in a report or recommendations for politicians or the government but organisers want to focus on actions the community could take themselves. That could involve coming up with ideas and then applying for grant funding to carry them out.  ""The assemblies are for everybody, you don't need to know anything about climate change, you can have any sorts of opinions and ideas,"" explained Nina Bentley of Gwyrddni, the lottery-funded organisation set up to run the project across Gwynedd. There has already been a UK assembly, as well as for Scotland and at local levels elsewhere in Wales. One leading academic who has been involved in evaluating the work of other climate assemblies said they were ""still an ongoing experiment in how to involve people in decision making"" around climate change. But Dr Stuart Capstick, deputy director of the centre for climate change and social transformations at Cardiff University, said that participants tended to feel ""positive about them and quite galvanised afterwards"". ""They go from being a bit curious through to becoming informed and quite active and outspoken as a result,"" he said. What is climate change doing to Wales?What does net zero mean?What will climate change look like for you? ""We know from our own research that the public is broadly speaking very concerned about climate change but often at a bit of a loss about where they fit in. ""Often it is presented as either this huge, vast complex international issue or it gets reduced to individual actions. ""So the value of these types of processes is they help to bridge that gap and give some context at a local level as to the type of policy measures or local actions that can be taken."" Back in Blaenau Ffestiniog, Ceri Cunnington is aware of the dangers this could descend into a talking shop. ""It's when you get higher up it's a talking shop,"" he said with a wry smile. ""Wales is brilliant at writing strategies, probably the best in the world. But acting on them is something completely different, and that's where community comes in. ""Community does respond, does work together and can come up with solutions, and we found that out during Covid."" As well as the Blaenau Ffestiniog area assembly, others are being set up for Pen LlÅ·n, Dyffryn Ogwen, Dyffryn Nantlle and Dyffryn Peris over the next two years.  Residents have until 4 April to sign up either in person or online before a representative panel of 50 people will be selected to take part in each area."

Could super-sized heat pumps make gas boilers extinct?,2022-03-18T02:02:53.000Z,"The war in Ukraine has forced a rethink of where we get our energy from as Europe tries to wean itself off Russian gas. But could super-sized heat pumps help to heat thousands of homes and businesses? Two huge schemes are about to be switched on in Gateshead and London - and the hope is they could provide a greener and cheaper source of warmth. ""Coal mining was massive in the North East,"" says Jim Gillon, walking across a building site in Gateshead. ""And where we're standing there are six different mine workings beneath our feet.""  Jim is the Energy Services Manager for Gateshead Council - and he's giving this former fossil fuel site a green makeover for an ambitious new heating scheme. He points to a borehole that descends 150m beneath the muddy earth. Like many old coal mines, it's now flooded with water. But the water is naturally warm at 15C - and this heat is key. Just a few metres away, a giant heat pump has been installed. It's a clever bit of engineering. In the same way that warmth can pass from one person to another when they shake hands, the warmth from the mine water is transferred into the closed heat pump system.  Through a series of processes a higher temperature, 80C, is reached and it's this heat that's sent out through pipes to be used by buildings in the local area. The mine water is sent back underground so the process can begin again.   The small, individual heat pumps that people install in their homes work using the same principle. They take some warmth - whether it's from the air or the ground - and then increase the temperature, providing heat for that one household.    But the heat pump in Gateshead is so large that at full capacity it can provide heat for the equivalent of 5,000 homes.""We're really pleased that we've taken the legacy of the coal mining and we're turning that negative asset into a positive future source of energy,"" says Jim. The buildings connected to the green district heating scheme have heat exchangers instead of boilers.  They shift the heat that arrives from the heat pumps to water in the pipes, to be used in kitchens and bathrooms and to run through radiators. Jacqueline Bell had one installed in her Gateshead home about five years ago - it's linked in to another local low-carbon network. She says that it involved a lot of upheaval to put in the new system, pipes had to be re-routed in the walls of her flat, but she's happy with the end result. ""I think my whole flat is much, much warmer than it used to be. And the cost is much, much cheaper too,"" she says.  Energy bills are a key concern for many consumers right now.  Gas prices were already rising steeply last year, but the war in Ukraine is pushing them to record highs as uncertainties grow over Europe's supply of gas that comes from Russia. The hunt is on for alternatives sources of energy. Michael Lewis, CEO of EON UK, thinks green district heating schemes could help.  ""They fundamentally change the landscape,"" he says.  ""It means we get off natural gas. So not only is that a benefit for the climate, it also means our energy prices are no longer tied to the volatile international gas market."" EON has installed its own super-sized heat pumps in the heart of London. The Citigen plant is hidden behind the imposing facade of the Port of London Authority building. Over the years it's provided energy using first coal, then oil and more recently gas.  Now it will supply a renewable source of heat by tapping into the warm water from an aquifer that sits beneath the city.  ""Heat pumps are low carbon because they are driven primarily by electricity - and in our case, the electricity will be renewable,"" explains Leke Oluwole, general manager at Citigen. He says the scheme provides green heating to lots of buildings in one go. ""Rather than having 1,000 homes to decarbonise, you have one central location to decarbonise, which will help with the net zero goals that we have in the UK."" Heating the UK's 30 million buildings currently contributes nearly a quarter of our greenhouse gas emissions, according to the government's Heat and Building's Strategy. ""If we're going to tackle climate change then we really need to fundamentally rethink the way we heat our buildings,"" says Dr Fleur Loveridge from the University of Leeds. For many homes, this will mean installing individual heat pumps. The government has announced ambitions for 600,000 to be installed every year by 2028.  But in places where housing is much more dense, green network heating schemes could be more suitable.  ""District heating systems in the UK only accounts for around 2% of our heating at the moment,"" Dr Loveridge explains. ""If we're going to reach our net zero emissions by 2050, we probably need to increase that to around 18%."" ""Green district heating is an absolutely essential feature of our future heating mix,"" she adds.   She says that the schemes aren't limited to places where there are flooded mines or aquifers - although there are many of these groundwater sites found across the UK. ""Anywhere where you can access the ground for the ground source heat will also work,"" she explains. ""Where you have surface water bodies, like rivers or lakes, that can also be made to work. Sea water has even been used to feed district heating systems.  ""So it's applicable in a lot of places, but not absolutely everywhere."" The huge heat pumps in London and Gateshead will soon be switched on, and the warmth generated will start to flow into local homes and businesses. But it's clear that these schemes are just the start. Many more will be needed if the UK is going to meet its climate change targets. Follow Rebecca on Twitter."
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release: Learning to live with freedom,2022-03-17T19:34:38.000Z,"After nearly six years of detention in Iran, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been reunited with her family. But how does someone return to normal life after a such a long period in confinement and what comes next? ""Take it gently,"" says former hostage Terry Waite, who spent nearly five years in captivity in Lebanon. He compares the experience of a captive adjusting to normal life to a diver returning to the surface, adding: ""Come up too quickly you get the bends. If you come out gently you'll be fine."" Mr Waite was freed in 1991 and later set up charity Hostage International, which supports released hostages and their families. ""It has been very difficult for Nazanin because of so many of the uncertainties - threatened with being rearrested, threatened with a longer term of imprisonment and never knowing,"" he says. ""And somehow she's had to learn how to live one day at a time."" Mr Waite says it took him about 12 months to really get back into life after his release. ""The whole experience they have been through has to be processed. Sometimes people need professional help from that, some do not. But they just need time.""  Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 43, returned to the UK from Tehran after her release was secured on Wednesday following months of negotiations. It marked the end of an ordeal that saw Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe detained after being accused in 2016 of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government. She always denied the claim. Why has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe been freed now?Iranian-Briton's family delighted at his releaseWho is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?Did tank debt cost Nazanin's freedom? Hostage International chief executive Lara Symons says the return home comes with lots of difficulties.  ""The spotlight is on you and everybody now sees you as a former hostage, and whatever you do with your life going forward you will be remembered as that former hostage,"" she says. ""You have that label - that badge - and you have to learn to wear that, and carry it because people see you through that prism.  ""That can be very difficult and it's a challenge, but can be turned into something positive as you see with Terry Waite."" She says people often have to learn how to take control of their own lives again and warns that even the most mundane tasks can pose challenges. ""People who have been in captivity whether they've been held by a criminal kidnapping group or imprisoned by a state, they haven't had the power to make their own decisions. ""I've heard hostages say on their return home they were offered chicken or pasta on airplane, and they couldn't make that decision.  ""The brain has to get use to adapting to being a free person and freedom of choice."" Lela Tsiskarishvili, psychologist and president of International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT), agrees. ""Things that might seem very simple can be very difficult for them to engage in,"" she says.  ""Often because the way the brain works means they are still in the past because of all the memories, preventing them being now and here in the present."" During her captivity, the charity Redress said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe needed urgent medical treatment for her mental health.  And Ms Tsiskarishvili, who has two decades of experience treating survivors of torture in detention, says detention can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. ""It's small steps and small victories because the experience can be so haunting,"" she says, adding: ""Sometimes I'm in awe of the clients we work with with."" Ms Tsiskarishvili also warns it can be difficult for the families as well.  ""It's difficult for children primarily. For parents it's also difficult to return to a kid who grew up several years later that there was limited contact with.  ""It's almost getting to know each other again. There are also problems with partners."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe spent her first night in the UK in bed with her husband Richard and seven-year-old daughter Gabriella in a safe house, her sister-in-law Rebecca Ratcliffe says. Barbara Ratcliffe, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's mother-in-law, says her granddaughter could not remember living with her mother and her son would find it hard adjusting too.  Tulip Siddiq, MP for Hampstead who helped campaign for the release, says: ""Richard is an accountant from West Hampstead. He's not a man who expected to go on TV on hunger strike, lobbying the prime minster and going to No 10.  ""They [Richard and Nazanin] are going to be very different people, and I think there will be a huge process in which they will have to get to know each other.  ""But also Gabriella has to trust her mother again as well."" Ms Symons says she finds children often help former detainees get back into routine.  ""Absolutely focusing on those small pleasures in life is a great way to start, and getting back into routine and having children in the family helps with that,"" she says. ""Children need routine so responding to that and having that to focus is really helpful.  ""But yes it's a long journey and it will take time. It's all about taking it day-by-day.  ""There is a positive light at the end."""
How a jetpack design helped create a flying motorbike,2022-03-18T01:06:11.000Z,"At around the age of 12, David Mayman tried to build a helicopter out of fence posts and an old lawn mower. Needless to say, it did not go well.  His contraption didn't fly and he was made to fix the fence. ""I was brought up in a way that I guess challenged me scientifically... I was always told that nothing's impossible,"" he says.  Perhaps he got a bit ahead of himself during his childhood in Sydney, but as an adult Mr Mayman, has built innovative machines that really do fly. After selling his online listings business Mr Mayman developed a jetpack, which in 2015 he flew around the Statue of Liberty. But, since 2018, he has been working on a different kind of project, one he thinks will have more commercial opportunities. Called the Speeder, his new machine will be like a flying motorbike. It will take off vertically, fly at high speeds, but be compact enough to fit in the back of a pick-up truck. Speeder is just one of many flying machine projects under way at the moment. There are currently hundreds of EVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft in development, with engineers hoping to create a new era of cheap, quiet air transportation. But Mr Mayman's machine is very different from those aircraft. Instead of being powered by batteries and electric engines, his Speeder uses four small jet engines, which run on aviation fuel. That might seem like a step backwards in technology, but for the customers Mr Mayman has in mind, only liquid fuel will do. He says the military, emergency services and the offshore energy industry want a fast, compact aircraft that can carry a significant weight. For that, you need jet fuel, as it stores 20 times the energy of batteries for a given weight. Or in other words, to supply the power needed, batteries would be too heavy. ""If you want to carry a certain payload, and you want that aircraft to have a certain range and certain speed, the only way to do that with current technology is, with turbine engines."" Mr Mayman explains. The Speeder idea emerged from work with the US Navy, who were interested in a jetpack for use by the Navy's special forces, the Seals. ""As is so often the case in aviation, you start with one set of specifications, and fairly quickly, you end up with an entirely different set of specs,"" he explains. ""They initially wanted something that would carry a payload of 210 pounds (95kg), not far into the project that morphed to nearly 300 pounds (135kg). And they wanted it to be possible to train somebody literally in 10 minutes,"" Mr Mayman says. None of that was possible with his existing jetpack product - something bigger and easier to fly would be needed, so the Speeder project was born. Some of the jetpack technology was helpful on the new project, but much of it had to be developed from scratch. To simplify things, while on the jetpack the direction of thrust is controlled mechanically by the pilot on the Speeder the angle of the four jet turbines is controlled by an electronic flight control system. The key part of that system is bespoke software that understands the physics of the four very powerful jets. This means that when the pilot lifts-off or turns, the Speeder can angle its jets to make that happen. Mr Mayman says that owners will not necessarily need a pilots licence, as the Speeder's flight control systems are doing much of the work to keep the aircraft steady. ""It's effectively AI (artificial intelligence) - if you want to call it that - that understands what the vehicle is going to need... so it can start instructing the engines to be spooling up or spooling down,"" says Mr Mayman. It's that aspect of artificial intelligence that interests Sajal Kissoon, a research assistant in gas turbine technology at Cranfield University's aerospace centre. ""The important enabler for this [the Speeder] is the use of AI to assist control. This, in itself, is a very exciting advancement,"" she explains. ""What if the Speeder faces unusual weather conditions, or unusual wind conditions, or an unusual manoeuvre by the pilot? I think AI would be essential to assist control,"" Ms Kissoon adds. More technology of business: Can technology tame the chaos of family life?Does your boss really care what you think?How Covid exposed India's 'crumbling' health sectorThe shipping giant banking on a greener fuel How Taiwan used simple tech to help contain Covid-19 Mr Mayman is hopeful that the Speeder will eventually be used to transport cargo. Piloted by remote control, or autonomously he thinks there will be demand particularly from the armed forces or emergency services. With a top speed of around 200mph and a flight time up to 60 minutes, Mr Mayman says it could get essential supplies for the military, or emergency services, very quickly to where they need to be. In cargo mode, where it is piloted remotely, it will be able to go even faster, perhaps at 500mph and carry 450kg. Being compact and able to fly in all sorts of weather conditions, he thinks it has the potential to be more versatile than a helicopter. But before you get too excited at the prospect of ditching the bus and hopping on a Speeder to work, Mr Mayman says it is unlikely to fly through cities. ""We make noise, we're incredibly powerful, we're incredibly small. I don't think there's necessarily a need within the urban air mobility space for an aircraft that can be the size of your kitchen table."" Crucially, a lot more testing still needs to be done before the Speeder is delivered to any customer. A third full-size prototype (called the P2) is being prepared for flight at test range about two hours east of Los Angeles.  There will be enough space there for the Speeder to be put through its paces. A key phase will also come late next year, when the company hopes to start the certification process. The company estimates that will take 12 months. If all goes to plan, the Speeder might be available for sale in late 2024 or 2025, although the military might be able to start flying it earlier, according to Mr Mayman. Unsurprisingly, all of his engineers want to be the first to fly the machine out in the desert, but Mr Mayman is saving that thrill for himself. ""It's pretty much the main reason they work here.

Drive My Car director Hamaguchi: Oscar buzz is beyond imagination,2022-03-17T23:45:44.000Z,"Ryusuke Hamaguchi is in uncharted waters. A well-known and respected director on the festival circuit through films such as Happy Hour and Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, his latest movie, Drive My Car, has catapulted him from the arthouse scene straight to the Hollywood hills. As a searing Japanese-language film about an actor/theatre director navigating his way through complicated grief following the sudden death of his wife, there were early suggestions it would be a frontrunner on the Academy Awards' international film shortlist. But as this gentle, absorbing epic slowly began to gain traction, it was ultimately rewarded with not one but four Oscar nominations last month - best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay and (no prizes for guessing) best international film. ""I'm surprised to see my work nominated for Oscars,"" Hamaguchi tells the BBC in his typically understated way, via an interpreter. ""And it's beyond my imagination, but getting interviews like this, I'm starting to realise this is real."" While the recognition may be unexpected, Hamaguchi is keen to point out that the divide between so-called indie films and Hollywood-backed studio movies isn't always as big as we might think. ""I don't think there's a big gap between the two and even arthouse films are appealing to the masses. A lot of classic films have a higher level of art and I don't think there's a lot of difference between the two,"" he says.  It's certainly true that this isn't the first time in recent years that an arthouse film has gained the Academy's attention, with movies such as Moonlight picking up best picture in 2016 and South Korean hit Parasite triumphing in the same category three years later. But Drive My Car is the first Japanese film to be nominated for an Oscar for best picture. It follows the story of Yusuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi Nishijima) whose wife Oto (Reika Kirishima) dies suddenly. Two years later, he drives his beloved vintage Saab 900 to Hiroshima to direct a production of Chekov's Uncle Vanya.  There he forms an unlikely friendship with his young female chauffeur Misaki Watari (Toko Miura) who is employed to drive him back and forth from rehearsals.  Kafuku listens to tapes of his late wife reading lines from the play in the car, processing his grief as he gradually opens up to Misaki, who in turn becomes less reticent as the film progresses. At three hours long - including a 40-minute prelude ahead of the opening credits - it's the longest film on this year's shortlist. Some critics have pointed out that a little endurance may be required due to the running time. Writing in The Observer, Wendy Ibe notes ""this is a supremely confident piece of film-making from Ryusuke Hamaguchi, albeit one that, at three hours long and with a rather Chekhov-heavy second half, will certainly require the right mindset"". But the overall consensus is that the film is richly rewarding, with a 98% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the LA Times's Justin Chang calling the film ""a haunting masterpiece"". Its length is in stark contrast to its source material, a sparse short story by renowned Japanese writer Haruki Murakami. So how did Hamaguchi and co-writer Takamasa Oe go about expanding the tale? ""Creating the screenplay was challenging,"" he admits. ""The original story is only about 40 pages long but deep inside there's a huge narrative by the author. And to use a house analogy, we've tried to dig deep and find a house buried deep down - we thought it was a house but it was actually a massive divine palace that we found.  ""So it developed and turned out to be huge,"" he explains. ""I read this short story when it was published in a magazine and I liked it.  ""I was attracted by the conversations in the car during which the two were getting closer and closer. There was a subtle expression about their relationship, and I have had that sort of experience myself in my own life. I started to feel I could relate to those two people within the novel and so I wanted to make it into a film,"" Hamaguchi says. I mention a recent article by a psychologist who suggested the best place to talk to uncommunicative teenagers was the car as it's an intimate setting but one where you don't have to make eye contact. Hamaguchi agrees. ""The car is a space where you don't have to look at each other, and it's a situation when you can create a relationship that wouldn't be possible outside of the car. And you don't get to be judgemental about the other person within this kind of space.  ""You can express your feelings and emotions in an honest way. You can be close to the other person and it can be intimate. And if you don't speak or express yourself, it could actually be awkward,"" he says. While three-hour films are not unheard of - think Avengers: Endgame for starters - it can be off-putting for some cinema-goers or even those streaming from the comfort of their sofa. But Hamaguchi says there was no pressure from the film company, Modern Films, to shorten it. ""It's not that I don't want it to be seen by anyone. On the contrary, I want as many people as possible to see this film. I wanted to make as short a film as possible! But when I created these charactersâ¦ and when I was editing the film, I saw it needed this kind of expression. ""It was down to the producers to make the final decision and after editing, they watched the film and decided that this was the best version possible. So in a way they took the risk and I'm really grateful for that."" The film also features a sizeable ensemble cast, with Hamaguchi deliberately choosing a multilingual cast for the Uncle Vanya play which means the actors cannot understand what each other are saying and have to rely on other cues. ""We needed to encourage different interactions between different actors... it's all about interplay. You need to look and listen."" The cast includes Park Yoo-Rim, who plays a deaf actress in the film, using Korean sign language. ""I wanted to use sign language because I was invited to a film festival for deaf people and sign language was a common way of communicating between them. I felt I was a bit like a foreign person in there,"" Hamaguchi explains.  ""It's simply another language... that I found very beautiful."" It's not hard to see the parallels between Chekov's protagonist Ivan - a man who is re-evaluating his life - and Kafuku. Chekhov is terrifying,"" Kafuku says in the script, because ""when you say his lines, it drags out the real you."" I ask what makes the film resonate with so many film-goers. ""People ask that question often,"" he replies, ""but I can only say I don't know why. Because I'm the one to convey the message. And I'm not the one to receive it."" He politely throws it back to me: ""Why do you think it is?"" I reply that perhaps it's because the journey of grief is such a universal one. And the grieving process cannot be rushed, which the film poignantly underlines. ""What you just said is about right and in essence, I think it all comes down to the universality of Murakami's narratives. These are people who lost somethingâ¦ you try to start your life again. And this kind of experience happens to everyone.  ""You've got to love, to love others and at one time, you will lose them. And it's absolutely universal. It's a very strong message from Murakami. He depicts the narrative in great detail. And I wanted to do that in the film context and I think I was successful to a certain degree."""

Sarah Everard: Killer Wayne Couzens charged with four counts of indecent exposure,2022-03-18T10:59:15.000Z,"Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens has been charged with four counts of indecent exposure. The alleged offences are said to have taken place between January and February 2021, when Couzens was a serving Metropolitan Police officer. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the alleged offences predate the murder of Ms Everard, who was killed in March 2021. Couzens will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 13 April. The 49-year-old is serving a whole-life tariff for the abduction, rape and murder of Ms Everard. Met detectives said the charges relate to a series of alleged sexual offences in Swanley, Kent, including on Valentine's Day last year. Other dates of alleged indecent exposure include between 22 January and 1 February; between 30 January and 6 February and on 27 February. Rosemary Ainslie, head of the CPS special crime division, said: ""Following a referral of evidence by the Metropolitan Police, the CPS has authorised four charges of indecent exposure against Wayne Couzens.""

Comic Relief: Red Nose Day raises Â£42m in star-studded show,2022-03-19T13:47:13.000Z,"More than Â£42.7m has been raised in Comic Relief's latest Red Nose Day broadcast, with a host of stars taking part in sketches and stunts. The charity show was broadcast from BBC studios in Salford for the first time. Highlights included Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders visiting The Repair Shop, and Matt Lucas and David Walliams reviving their Rock Profiles sketches. But stars Zoe Ball, Kylie Minogue and Joel Dommett had to pull out of the show after catching Covid. At shortly after midnight, Red Nose Day announced it had raised Â£42,790,147 for good causes in the UK and around the world. Some of the money will benefit organisations providing aid in Ukraine. Comic Relief co-founder Richard Curtis thanked the ""extraordinary public"" for their ""outpouring of generosity"". He said the charity helped 11 million people last year. The show's presenters sent their love to Ball, who was due to be one of the hosts, with actor David Tennant saying: ""We will miss you tonight Zoe, we are sending you loads of love."" Ball said she would be ""watching & supporting from bed"". Minogue told followers she wouldn't be able to take part in a planned sketch with the cast of BBC sitcom Ghosts. And the event's co-host Dommett said he was ""super annoyed"" to have caught the virus before Red Nose Day. Dommett was replaced by Vernon Kay, while Ball said Alesha Dixon would ""work the double shift tonight"" to fill in for her. ""I owe you lady love,"" she told her on Twitter. Covid-19 infections have continued to increase in England, with about one in 20 people in private households estimated to have had the virus in the week to 12 March, according to the Office for National Statistics. Sir Lenny Henry, Tennant, AJ Odudu and Paddy McGuinness were Comic Relief's other presenters, and were rotated during the broadcast which lasted nearly four hours. It was announced during the programme that Tom Daley's Hell Of A Homecoming challenge - in which the Olympic diver rowed, swam, cycled and ran for 290 miles over four days from London to his hometown of Plymouth - had raised Â£1,027,111. The show also saw comedian Jack Whitehall playing England footballers Declan Rice and Mason Mount in a mini-golf challenge - with Whitehall coming in last place as West Ham midfielder Rice won. The lifelong Arsenal fan was forced to post a photo on Instagram of himself in a West Ham shirt as a forfeit. Strictly Come Dancing champions Rose Ayling Ellis and Giovanni Pernice performed to a rendition of How Long Will I Love You. Reviving their Rock Profile comedy sketch show for a one-off special, Lucas and Walliams impersonated stars such as Adele, Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga. French and Saunders reprised characters from their sketch show - two overacting film extras - as they visited the Repair Shop, asking host Jay Blades and his team of skilled artisans to fix their toaster, ""a family heirloom"". The sketch also featured Dame Judi Dench as a character who arrived at the shop to have an old doll from her childhood repaired, only for French and Saunders to smash its head to pieces. Last year, the annual event raised more than Â£55m for good causes in the UK and around the world. Other famous faces to appear during the fundraising show include Tom Holland, Courteney Cox, Lulu, Paul Rudd, Chris Kamara, Vic Reeves, Jeff Goldblum, Clive Myrie, Jamie Dornan and Gordon Ramsay."
British Sign Language set for legal recognition,2022-03-18T15:03:25.000Z,"British Sign Language (BSL) is set to gain formal recognition after MPs backed the proposal. A bill requiring public bodies to promote the language will now go to the House of Lords, as it continues its journey to becoming law. It will also recognise BSL as a language in its own right in England, Wales and Scotland. The legislation, introduced by Labour MP Rosie Cooper, is being backed by the government. Up to 250,000 people in the UK use some BSL on a daily basis, according to the British Deaf Association. How to sign the alphabet in British Sign LanguageStrictly's Rose Ayling-Ellis calls for sign language lawStrictly star inspires sign language lessons surge Disabilities Minister Chloe Smith said legally recognising it would help deliver better public services to deaf people. while creating ""a more inclusive and accessible society, improving the lives of deaf people and helping public services to do it right"". The bill would require government departments to follow guidance on how the use of BSL can be put in place across services.  Although it will not allocate any new funds for BSL promotion, Ms Smith argued this issue was a ""red herring"", as the Equalities Act already ensures deaf people must have access to public services.  Kelsey Gordon is currently directing an interactive performance co-produced by a theatre that specialises in plays acted in BSL. The actor and stage director says deaf people ""need a stronger presence"" in the arts.  ""We're tiptoeing our way through it at the moment, and we need to blast those doors open,"" she adds.  ""BSL is our language, it is really important to have a deaf representative in the room."" Ms Cooper, MP for West Lancashire, grew up using BSL and said her bill was about ""doing what is right"" and would ""begin the process"" of giving deaf people ""equal equal access to the essential services that everyone else takes for granted"".  ""No longer will they need to feel not heard, ignored and invisible,"" she added. Ms Cooper has also backed an initiative under which MPs will be offered lessons to learn BSL. MPs backed the British Sign Language Bill without the need for a vote."

P&O: Agency worker describes Cairnryan 'mystery bus tour',2022-03-18T12:29:03.000Z,"An agency worker brought in at short notice to replace sacked P&O Ferries staff said he turned and left when he realised what was going on. Mark Canet-Baldwin, from Hull, says he was hired a week ago and was kept in the dark about the ship he would be on. After a ""mystery bus tour"" from Glasgow to the P&O dock in Cairnryan with security staff in tow, Mr Canet-Baldwin said he worked out the situation.  ""I couldn't look my kids in the eye if I did something like this,"" he said.  P&O said it was a ""tough"" decision to sack 800 workers without notice but it would ""not be a viable business"" without the changes. Protests against the move are due to be held on Friday at the ports of Dover, Hull. Liverpool and Larne.  Mr Canet-Baldwin, who's originally from Australia and lives in Welton, said he was hired to work as an onboard services manager after seeing a job advert on Facebook, but the agency couldn't tell him anything about the vessel. He was put up in a hotel on Monday in Glasgow with training staff and was driven at 05:30 GMT on Thursday to an undisclosed location, which turned out to be Cairnryan. ""We thought it was a new ship and it was going to be launched with some hurrah,"" he said. A fellow agency worker had been employed on P&O's European Highlander vessel three weeks earlier and called a contact who worked on the ship once they spotted it in the dock.  ""They told us they'd all been sacked, we could hear one young lady in the background in tears, poor thing, she'd got a mortgage last week,"" Mr Canet-Baldwin said. ""We heard of guys doing normal things, hoping to buy cars or get ready for the summer, everyday normal things, and they were just devastated."" Mr Canet-Baldwin said a number of agency workers then walked away, adding: ""My conscience started to play up and I thought, 'what are we doing?' ""We're not just going to crew a vessel, we're taking these people's jobs - I just came to the decision that I couldn't do it."" He says he took off his hard hat and overalls and, along with three others, got off the bus and went home. The government said it would review its contracts with P&O Ferries, with unions calling it a ""dark day"" in the shipping industry.  Discussing the decision to lay-off 800 workers, P&O Ferries said: ""We have made a Â£100m loss year-on-year, which has been covered by our parent DP World. This is not sustainable.

Max Verstappen: 'A mistake or crash can happen in a blink',2022-03-18T10:42:08.000Z,"Every sport has its moment in the spotlight.   And for one night in December 2021, it felt like the whole world was watching Formula 1. Record numbers tuned in as Max Verstappen was crowned the F1 drivers world champion of 2021 in the most controversial circumstances imaginable.  And that controversy followed Max throughout the season, as many questioned whether the 24-year-old needed to be so aggressive. Last year rivalry between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen got intense. Wheel to wheel racing, spectacular crashes, off-track mind games, emotion, anger - it had it all. This weekend, the new F1 season starts and people will be hoping for more of the same - including the world champion himself. ""You want to be as consistent as you can be. Of course, you know, you're not a robot, things can happen,"" Max tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. There's no playing it cool with Max. He readily admits how much he enjoys being called a world champion. Getting to this stage, however, was by no means simple. At the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Max Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton on the last lap to clinch his first Formula 1 title in dramatic fashion. But there was controversy over the way rules regarding the safety car - which comes out when there's a crash, to slow the speed of the cars and stopping racing - were applied. Many have said the rules were not followed correctly and disadvantaged Lewis Hamilton. Those rules have now been clarified by the sport's bosses so the same thing cannot happen again. But with a win so controversial, people have wondered whether it would take the shine off beating the seven-time British champion. ""Clearly not. It is what it is. People have their own opinions and that's fine,"" says Max. In Bahrain, just before the 2022 season gets started, we find a different Max. He's joking with reporters, laughing about football, exercise and the weather. He's back for a new year and he's here to have fun. Max has signed a new contract meaning he'll be a Red Bull driver until at least 2028, which he says ""wasn't really a difficult decision"". He thinks it's important to have a good time with the people he's travelling around the world with, away from family and friends, which he does ""with everyone in the team"". ""I enjoy working with the people here. We achieved our goal together."" Max proudly wears the number one on his cap and on his car. He's the champion and this weekend starts the task of winning it again.  ""It's all about just trying to understand, that if today is not the day to win I still need score points.""  And despite some arguing otherwise, Max admits that was his approach last year too. ""A mistake or crash can happen in a blink.  ""And when it does, when we are racing wheel to wheel, people always very quickly say, 'ah but you shouldn't have taken so much risk'.  ""But then you wouldn't fight, you'd always stay behind or not go for the move. ""You have to calculate the risk."" As Formula 1 moves in to a new era, a lot is unknown. But one thing we do know. Max Verstappen will always fight. He has that number one, and boy does he want to keep it. So with all the controversy that came last year - will anything change about his style in 2022?  ""Maybe my hairstyle, maybe a bit shorter. My girlfriend likes it long, but I like it short. So you have to find a middle way,"" Max says. Max is trying, not entirely convincingly to keep a straight face. ""Oh the driving? That is going to be the same of course."" Hear the full interview with Max on The BBC 5Live Chequered Flag podcast.

Ukraine war: Russia destroys aircraft repair plant near western city of Lviv,2022-03-18T12:26:07.000Z,"Russian missiles have hit an aircraft repair plant near Lviv in western Ukraine, a city that has become a safe haven for people fleeing the war. Emergency vehicles raced to the site of the strike, just 6km (four miles) from the city centre, after three loud explosions were heard early on Friday. No-one was injured in the attack. It is the closest the conflict has come to Lviv, a key humanitarian supply route and a hub for hundreds of thousands of people who have fled. Western Ukraine has so far been quieter than the rest of the country. Russia launched its invasion on three fronts - from the north, east and south - leaving cities such as Lviv relatively unscathed. But there are signs that may be changing, after Friday's strike and a deadly missile attack on a military training base outside the city on Sunday. ""There have been air raid alarms here every morning, but now the strikes are actually landing,"" Valentin Vovchenko, 82, told the AFP news agency from Lviv. ""We fled Kyiv because of the attacks but now they've started to hit here."" LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyANALYSIS: What does Putin want and will Russia end its war?RUSSIA: Putin lays out his demandsWATCH: On the front line with Ukraine's armyIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict The city's mayor, Andriy Sadovy, confirmed that the military aircraft maintenance facility had been destroyed by cruise missiles.  The facility, which was not in operation at the time, is only a short distance from the Danylo Halytskyi International Airport. Mr Sadovy, however, said the airport itself had not been hit. Ukraine's air force said six cruise missiles had been fired in total from the Black Sea. Two of them were destroyed by anti-aircraft missiles. ""The Russians are going for the infrastructure that is keeping Ukrainian aircraft in the air,"" Prof Michael Clarke, the former director of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, told the BBC. Lviv is just 80km from Poland, a country that has taken in more than two million Ukrainians who are seeking refuge from a conflict that has destroyed homes and upended lives. Prof Clarke said that, given the facility's proximity to the Polish border, the strike could be seen as ""an attempt to frighten the West out of helping Ukrainians as much as they have been"". Unlike its indiscriminate shelling of Ukrainian cities, Russia appears to be using its long-range precision weapons - like cruise missiles - to hit specific military sites.  And the target list appears to be expanding to the west of the country. It's likely this facility was used to maintain Ukraine's dwindling number of older fighter jets. The fact that Russia is using long-range missiles illustrates another important fact - one that has surprised many military analysts. So far, Russia has failed to gain supremacy in the air. Western officials say Ukraine's air defences have been a key reason for that.  But as this attack shows, Russia recognises that it needs to degrade those air defences. Not just by targeting them directly, but also by destroying ground-based missiles batteries which are being used every day of this war. Ukraine no doubt needs more supplies. One Western intelligence official told the BBC that Kyiv has been ""very specific"" in requesting more air defence ammunition  - including for its older long-range air defence systems. The official said they are needed in large quantities because of the sheer number of Russian aircraft. ""It is very much a part of war that you go after each other's supply lines,"" UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told the BBC.  ""But the reality is this development will be a concern for people living in the west of Ukraine."" He added that the UK was in the process of training up Ukrainians to use Starstreak anti-aircraft missile systems, which he said would arrive in the country imminently. Several major cities also faced fresh aerial attacks on Friday.  In the eastern city of Kharkiv, one person was killed and 11 were injured when a university building and two blocks of flats were shelled.  Further south, in Kramatorsk, two people were killed and six were injured in a missile attack. And in the capital Kyiv, one person was killed after a downed missile exploded in a residential neighbourhood."
Ukraine: Arnold Schwarzenegger's anti-war video trends on Russian social media,2022-03-18T13:09:12.000Z,"A video address by Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger to the Russian people was trending on Russian Twitter on Friday and has sparked reaction.  In it, Schwarzenegger warns Russians they are being fed misinformation about their country's assault on Ukraine. Addressing Russian President Vladimir Putin directly, he says: ""You started this war, and you can stop it"". His intervention has been praised by Russians who oppose the war in Ukraine. Writing on the Telegram app, opposition politician Lev Shlosberg said it had been filmed ""with respect towards us, Russian people"". ""Arnold Schwarzenegger has a unique ability to talk to anyone with persuasion, respect and on equal terms. Wits, power and justice. Have a listen. Think about it. Understand,"" Mr Shlosberg said. Also on Telegram, liberal journalist Anton Orekh said his message contained no ""Russophobia"". ""We are outcasts in the world.. Arnold is one of the few people who addressed Russians not as savage orcs, but as good people who have lost their ways,"" Mr Orekh said. But a pro-Kremlin spoof account, Barack Obmana on Twitter, derided it, saying ""the opinion of paid US talking heads"" mattered little to Russians. Russia has consistently said the war in Ukraine was a ""special operation"" to protect Russian-speaking Ukrainians. But in his video, Schwarzenegger said the Kremlin was lying to Russians when it said the invasion was intended to ""denazify"" Ukraine.  Ukraine did not start the war, but ""those in power in the Kremlin"" did, he said.  By 13:00 GMT the video had been viewed nearly 25m times and had been retweeted 325,000 times. Schwarzenegger is one of the few accounts followed by the Kremlin's official Russian- and English-language Twitter accounts. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter In the nine-minute video, which also shows footage of the destruction in Ukraine, the actor-turned-politician calls on people to see through disinformation and propaganda. ""I'm speaking to you today because there are things going on in the world that are being kept from you, terrible things that you should know about,"" he says. ""Ukraine did not start this war, neither did nationalists or Nazis,"" the former California governor says, noting that the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is Jewish. ""This is not the Russian people's war."" The Austrian-born former bodybuilding champion - whose film Red Heat was the first US film shot in Moscow's Red Square - speaks of his affection for the Russian people and talks about being inspired as a youth by Russian Olympic weightlifter Yuri Vlasov. He also talks about his father, who was among Nazi German troops who attacked St Petersburg - then called Leningrad - during World War Two. He returned a ""broken man"" full of pain from a wound he sustained during fighting and the guilt he felt at having taken part. ""The strength and the heart of the Russian people have always inspired me,"" he says. ""That is why I hope that you will let me tell you the truth about the war in Ukraine."" He goes on to say: ""This is an illegal war. Your lives, your limbs, your futures have been sacrificed for a senseless war condemned by the entire world.""

Covid: Rise in UK infections driven by BA.2 Omicron variant,2022-03-18T13:19:45.000Z,"Covid cases have continued to rise in the UK, with an estimated one in every 20 people infected, figures from the Office for National Statistic suggest.  All age groups are affected, including the 75s and over, who are due a spring booster jab to top up protection. Hospital cases are also rising, but vaccines are still helping to stop many severe cases, say experts. An easily spread sub-variant of Omicron, called BA.2, is now causing most cases. Recent easing of restrictions and waning immunity from the vaccines could be factors behind the rise too. What is the BA.2 variant?Extra Covid booster vaccine in springHow many cases are there in my area? The ONS infection survey, which tests thousands of people randomly in households across the UK, estimates that 3.3 million people would have tested positive in the week ending 12 March - up from 2.6 million the previous week. Scotland has seen infection levels rise for seven weeks in a row. They have now reached a new record high, with 376,300 people estimated to have had Covid last week, or one in 14. Infection rates across the nations were: England: 4.9%, up from 3.8% last week - approximately one in 20 peopleWales: 4.1%, up from 3.2% last week - approximately one in 25 peopleNorthern Ireland: 7.1% , down from 7.8% last week - approximately one in 14 peopleScotland: 7.15% up from 5.7% last week - approximately one in 14 people  It comes as the UK continues to lift previous Covid restrictions. As of Friday, people arriving in the UK will no longer need to take a Covid test, even if they haven't been vaccinated.  It is part of the government's Living with Covid strategy that relies on personal responsibility and mass vaccination to protect the public, rather than laws and limits on what people are allowed to do.  Scotland's rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport will, however, remain in place until April due to the rise in Covid. Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said Scotland was showing the highest level of infections yet. ""It's notable also that infections have risen in all age groups, with the over-70s reaching their highest estimate since our survey began,"" she added. Prof James Naismith, Director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, and Professor of Structural Biology, University of Oxford, said the high infection rates around the UK currently, with few Covid restrictions, meant that almost anyone could catch the virus.  He said: ""My main concern is for the vulnerable for whom this disease is serious. ""Every effort must be made to triple vaccinate as many people as possible, quadruple vaccinate the most vulnerable."" Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld told the BBC: ""Let's hope we are heading towards the peak or we are already at it in terms of infection because the problems in our hospitals are, once again, pretty acute."" She said Scotland might soon be reaching a new high for Covid hospital admissions. "

Putin hails Crimea annexation and war with lessons on heroism,2022-03-18T16:04:22.000Z,"Eight years after Russian troops seized Ukraine's southern region of Crimea, the event is being celebrated with flag-waving crowds in Moscow's Luzhniki stadium and special lessons in schools. President Vladimir Putin made a special appearance before the crowd. State workers said they had been told to take part. In schools, teachers held lessons marking the ""Crimean spring"". The Russian army has used its bases in Crimea to seize towns and cities on Ukraine's south coast. Mr Putin has regularly used the anniversary to highlight love of the motherland.  Officials said more than 200,000 people had gathered at the stadium, although the numbers could not be verified. The stadium's official capacity is 81,000, but there were also large crowds outside. President Putin praised the military, who he said had demonstrated Russian unity: ""When needed, they shield each other from bullets with their bodies like brothers. Such unity we have not had for a long time."" He also repeated the false claim that Russian troops were protecting people in areas of eastern Ukraine from genocide. But as he spoke on stage, his address on almost every major state TV channel suddenly cut to singer Oleg Gazmanov belting out the words ""Forward, Russia"", in what the Kremlin later called a technical glitch. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin also addressed the event along with top state TV journalist Margarita Simonyan and foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. By Will Vernon, BBC News Moscow  I spoke to dozens of people queueing to enter the venue for the pro-Kremlin rally. Many told the BBC they worked in the public sector, and that they had been pressured into attending by their employers.  One man who works in the Moscow metro, told us that he and other employees had been forced to attend the rally. ""I'll be here for a while and then I'll leaveâ¦ I think most people here don't support the war. I don't,"" he said. Many people didn't want to be filmed or answer questions.  Students told us they had been given the option of a day off from lectures if they attended ""a concert"". Some of the students we spoke to didn't even know that the event was dedicated, in part, to support the war in Ukraine.  There were doubtless some people in attendance who genuinely support President Putin and the ""special military operation in Ukraine"", as the Kremlin prefers to call it.  Special lessons on the war entitled ""My Country"" began at the start of March, for students in the final six years of school. Pupils were played a video of Mr Putin from 21 February, in which he detailed his vision of Ukraine's history, BBC Russian reports. Photographs emerged earlier this week of children lining up to form the letter Z, a symbol painted on Russian military vehicles that have invaded Ukraine.  The education ministry then sent out lesson plans specifically geared to 18 March, the date that Russia annexed Crimea after an internationally discredited referendum. According to a memo sent to schools by the education ministry, lessons for children in Years 6-8 (12-15 year-olds) should focus on ""heroes of our time... to help form a stable and grounded understanding of the feeling of patriotism"". Pupils were to be asked to sit in a circle to hear an explanation of how ideas of ""duty, dignity and patriotism are inextricably linked with the concepts of exploits and heroism"". Teachers would then show a video to show that people with military roles were more likely to become heroes than anyone else. A separate video was sent out to schools giving Russia's version of the events surrounding the annexation of Crimea. In the video, two uniformed teenagers from Crimea are asked if they know what happened on 18 March 2014. One says that for him, as a resident of Sevastopol in Crimea, it was a day of celebration, when the ""Crimean Spring"" was accomplished. Another teenager, Anna, is asked why the events are known as spring: ""Spring is the start of new life. It is renewal, warmth, the sun. And of course, a cosy home."" One teacher in Moscow region spoke of taking the day off out of disgust. ""I don't like history being used for propaganda. I think this is dangerous, because there are a lot of children here who have relatives in Ukraine. This can provoke conflicts among children,"" said the teacher, who prefers to remain anonymous. Most of her colleagues said they were in favour of the lessons. ""Even those with relatives under the bombs approve. They say the Nazis should have been kicked out a long time ago,"" the teacher said, referring to Russia's false characterisation of Ukraine's leadership. A number of teachers have complained about the ""My Country"" lessons. One teacher from Volgograd called Svetlana said that for some of the children war was something of an adventure. ""I explained there's nothing good in war,"" she told BBC Russian.

Strip-searched Hackney schoolgirl to sue Met Police,2022-03-18T19:15:45.000Z,"A black pupil who was strip-searched after being wrongly suspected of carrying drugs is suing the Met Police. The 15-year-old, also known as Child Q, is also taking civil action against her school, the law firm Bhatt Murphy said. Scotland Yard has apologised after a safeguarding report found the search was unjustified and racism was ""likely"" to have been a factor. Speaking via her lawyers, the girl said she wanted ""cast-iron commitments to ensure this never happens again"". In a statement, she said: ""I want to thank the thousands of people across the world of all backgrounds who have offered me support - both publicly and through messages conveyed to my legal team - following everything I've been through.  ""I know I am not alone."" Hundreds of people attended a protest organised by Hackney Cop Watch at Stoke Newington police station. During the incident, the girl was taken out of an exam to the school's medical room and strip-searched by two female Met police officers searching for cannabis, while teachers remained outside. No other adult was present and her parents were not contacted. Her intimate body parts were exposed and she was made to take off her sanitary towel, according to the review. No drugs were found.  The victim's mother told the safeguarding review that after the strip-search, her daughter had been ""asked to go back into the exam"" she had been sitting with no teacher asking about her welfare. Her family said the girl had changed from ""top of the class"" to ""a shell of her former bubbly self"", and she was now self-harming and required therapy. Treat strip-search as gross misconduct case - mayorStrip-searching schoolgirl was 'sexual assault'Police powers reviewed under racial disparity plan One of Friday's protesters told the BBC ""she can't even fathom"" the ""disgusting"" treatment of the teenager. She said: ""What they did to that child has brought tears to my eyes every day because I'm thinking 'could that have been my daughter once upon a time, could that be my granddaughter?"" London's mayor Sadiq Khan has written to the head of the police watchdog urging them to consider a case of gross misconduct. However, the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) said its investigation was complete and its report was being ""finalised"". It added three police constables had been served with notices last year advising them they were under investigation for misconduct, ""over their roles in either carrying out the strip search or involvement in supervising it"". Scotland Yard has said the officers' actions were ""truly regrettable"" and it ""should never have happened"". Met Police Commander Dr Alison Heydari said: ""While we await the findings of the IOPC investigation, we have already taken action to ensure that our officers and staff have a refreshed understanding of the policy for conducting a 'further search' and advice around dealing with schools, ensuring that children are treated as children."" By Celestina Olulode, BBC News ""We love you Child Qâ¦ and we pray for resolve. Keep your head up"". That was the message of solidarity from Ayesha, one mother on this march. Hundreds of people stood outside Stoke Newington police station, holding placards and banners. The crowds stopped traffic and buses were diverted. ""No police in schools"" and ""schools + cops = violence"" were some of the messages people posted on the walls of the police station.  Amid chants of ""protect black girls"", nearby cars beeped their horns. Hackney MP Diane Abbott spoke of a community ""confronted by brutality from police officers all over again"".  Several other people made speeches and demanded justice. But while there's a clear sense of anger, this is also a community feeling traumatised.  Many here say they are worried about the current safeguarding measures in place in schools. Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to hellobbclondon@bbc.co.uk"
Roman Abramovich's jet among 100 planes grounded by US,2022-03-18T18:13:07.000Z,"Nearly 100 planes with ties to Russia have been effectively grounded by the US government, including one owned by billionaire Roman Abramovich. The US Commerce Department has said the planes are in contravention of US sanctions on Russia. Providing service to these aircraft anywhere in the world - including inside Russia - may lead to heavy fines and potential jail time, it says.  The list includes aircraft operated by Russian airlines, including Aeroflot.  While most are Boeing aircraft, a Gulfstream private jet owned by Mr Abramovich - the current owner of Chelsea football club - is also included.  The Russian was among seven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK government earlier this month in response to the Ukraine war. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. In a statement, the department said any refuelling, maintenance or repair work of any of the listed aircraft - as well as the provision of spare parts - violates US export controls.  Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was in response to ""Russia's brutal war of choice against Ukraine"". She added: ""We are publishing this list to put the world on notice - we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws.""  The department said violators face ""substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions"". The regulations apply to any aircraft which has more than 25% US-origin content that was re-exported to Russia after new controls came into effect on 24 February, the day Russia invaded Ukraine.  ""By preventing these aircraft from receiving any service, for example, including from abroad, international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded,"" the statement added.  Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said the US government hoped the move highlighted Russia's increasing isolation from the global economy. ""Our actions aren't idle words or dead letters on the page,"" he said. ""They have real teeth and as Putin's vicious war continues, they will continue to bite harder on the Russian and Belarusian economies"".  The US, Canada and European allies have already banned Russian aircraft from operating in their airspace, forcing Russian airlines to largely abandon their international routes. "
"Morad Tahbaz, released in Nazanin deal, back in Iran jail",2022-03-18T17:54:37.000Z,"A British-US national temporarily released from prison in Iran two days ago has been returned to jail, his family says. Morad Tahbaz, who also holds Iranian citizenship, had been released on furlough on the same day two other dual British nationals were released. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori have since returned to the UK and been reunited with their families. Mr Tahbaz, 66, was doing conservation work when he was held in January 2018. The authorities accused him and seven other conservationists of collecting classified information about Iran's strategic areas under the pretext of carrying out environmental and scientific projects. On Wednesday UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss announced that Mr Tahbaz had been released to his home in Tehran on furlough. She said Mr Tahbaz, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori had been freed as a ""result of tenacious and creative British diplomacy"". However on Friday Mr Tahbaz's family said they had received ""devastating news"" that he had been returned to prison. ""We the family are distraught at this moment,"" they said in a statement. ""We were confident and assured that the UK government had taken on responsibility to secure his release... After the euphoria of Nazanin and Anoosheh's homecoming, there's a worrying sense that the UK government hasn't pressed the Iranian authorities for Morad's freedom in the same way."" Reacting to the development, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the Iranians had told the UK Government that Mr Tahbaz had been taken to Evin prison to fit an ankle tag that should have been fitted before his release.  ""We hope to see him returned to his home in the coming hours,"" the FCDO said. ""Morad Tahbaz is a tri-national and we are working closely with the United States to secure Morad's permanent release."" Why has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe been freed now?Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?Fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Mr Tahbaz was arrested during a crackdown on environmental activists in January 2018. He was part of a team from the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation which had been using cameras to track endangered species, according to Amnesty International. But in October 2018, Mr Tahbaz and three of his fellow conservationists were charged with ""corruption on earth"" (later changed to ""co-operating with the hostile state of the US""), which carries the death penalty. Three others were charged with espionage, and a fourth was accused of acting against national security. All eight denied the charges and Amnesty International said there was evidence that they had been subjected to torture in order to extract forced ""confessions"". In November 2019, they were sentenced to prison terms ranging from four to 10 years and ordered to return allegedly ""illicit income"". Human Rights Watch denounced what it said was an unfair trial, during which the defendants were apparently unable to see the full dossier of evidence against them. UN human rights experts warned last year that Mr Tahbaz's health condition had continuously deteriorated during his imprisonment. Despite that, they added, he had been denied access to proper treatment."

P&O Ferries sackings: Government to review contracts with ferry firm,2022-03-18T22:40:44.000Z,"All P&O Ferries contracts across government will be reviewed in response to the way it sacked 800 workers. Staff have been protesting after many were told without warning by video message on Thursday that it would be ""their final day of employment"". In a letter to the company, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""deeply concerned"" at the move and questioned whether it was legal. P&O said it was a ""last resort"" to save the business. Passengers have been left stranded with services cancelled since the announcement. The ferry company said it was aiming to have the first ones ""running again in the next day or two as we lose Â£1m a day for each day they are not moving"". A Department for Transport spokesperson could not provide details on the current value of government contracts awarded to P&O Ferries, but Labour Party analysis of the public sector contracts database Tussle found the company had received Â£38.3m in taxpayer-funded contracts since December 2018. One government contract for freight between Tilbury and Zeebrugge for nine months was worth Â£10.9m. Mr Shapps urged the company to pause the redundancies announced and instructed the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to inspect all vessels to make sure replacement crews ""rushed through"" were safe to go to sea. He has also asked the Insolvency Service to look at the laws around notification requirements to see if P&O followed correct and legal processes so the government ""can consider if further action is appropriate"". Protests have been staged in Dover, Liverpool, Hull and elsewhere in the UK against the P&O redundancies, while the vessels stay docked at ports and ferry cancellations cause travel disruption. Dover MP heckled by angry P&O Ferries protestersP&O Ferries sparks outrage by sacking 800 workersProtesters turn out in force against P&O sackings Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has also written to the ferry operator's chief executive demanding answers to P&O Ferries' handling of the redundancies. Mr Kwarteng's letter to its boss Peter Hebblethwaite says the company ""appears to have failed"" to follow the correct process for making large-scale redundancies, which would include consulting with unions and staff representatives and notifying him through the Insolvency Service and the Redundancy Payment Service. The letter says failure to notify is ""a criminal offence and can lead to an unlimited fine"". Mr Kwarteng's questions to P&O Ferries include asking for details on the exact number of redundancies and how many of these involved any consultation, as well as the location of work for each staff member dismissed. Additionally, he asked if staff made redundant were offered alternative roles directly for P&O Ferries or similar roles on new terms and conditions through an agency. Workers have spoken of their ""utter dismay"" after hearing the news and of feeling abandoned by the company. Andrew Smith, who had worked for the company for 22 years, said: ""It's our lives. It's how our families have grown up, knowing that this is what we do, and it's just been turned on its head within a matter of hours."" And James, who has worked for P&O Ferries in Dover for about four years, said all he received ""was a three minute pre-recorded message saying we are out of a job. Nothing else."" ""It was a complete surprise. I would have understood if it was at the height of Covid, but now we're seeing the end of travel restrictions and the start of summer bookings. So this has come completely out of the blue,"" he said. The business secretary also raises the company's previous application for government support when Covid lockdowns disrupted travel. ""It is particularly depressing that this should happen given the millions of pounds of British taxpayer support P&O companies received from the furlough scheme,"" he wrote. P&O Ferries is owned by Dubai-based DP World which also owns ports at London and Southampton. DP World recently announced Â£8bn in revenues last year. During the Covid pandemic the company claimed more than Â£15m in grants and furlough assistance.  In a new statement on Friday, P&O Ferries said: ""We took this difficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn't survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies."" The RMT union labelled the move one of the ""most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations"".  Its national secretary Darren Procter told a crowd of about 250 demonstrators in Dover: ""We're going to make sure our workers get back on board their vessels."" "
Diplomats spar over 'edited' Russian letter,2022-03-18T14:32:55.000Z,"Russia has accused Canada of ""kindergarten-level"" diplomacy in a Twitter tiff over a social media post by Canada's United Nations mission.  The diplomatic spat is over a letter seeking support for a draft Russian resolution about aid in Ukraine. Canada posted the letter to Twitter with ""suggested edits"", which led to retweets from other UN missions. A Russian diplomat has called it ""Russophobic libel"". An image of the letter - annotated in red type - was posted on Canada's official UN mission Twitter account on Thursday. The letter, signed by Russian diplomat Vassily Nebenzia, had been sent to all UN members the previous day. In it, Mr Nebenzia says he is ""reaching out with regards to an urgent matter related to the dire humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine"".  Canada's annotation adds to that line: ""which we have caused as a result of our illegal war of aggression"".  The letter goes on to say that ""Western colleagues"" are ""politicising the humanitarian issue"". Canada adds ""Do you think the UN membership actually believes this? Please explain."" Dmitry Polyanskiy, first deputy permanent representative of Russia to the United Nations, responded to the tweet, saying it ""shows that your diplomatic skills and good manners are at lowest ebb"" and reminding Canada that it twice failed to secure enough support to win a non-permanent seat on the powerful UN Security Council.  The letter was meant to boost support for a draft resolution on providing humanitarian relief in Ukraine, which was scheduled for a vote on Friday at the UN Security Council. The resolution has been criticised by Western nations for its failure to mention Russia's responsibility for the war.  That scheduled vote was cancelled by Russia on Thursday. The United States' envoy to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Russia's resolution was ""farcical"" and ""doomed to fail"", according to the AFP news agency. "
Joanne Tulip: Justice Secretary blocks killer's move to open prison,2022-03-18T19:38:42.000Z,"A bid to move the killer of Joanne Tulip to an open prison has been blocked by Dominic Raab. The Justice Secretary rejected the transfer of Steven Ling, overruling a Parole Board recommendation. Ling was jailed for life in December 1998 after he admitted to the murder of Ms Tulip in Stamfordham, Northumberland, on Christmas Day 1997. A spokesman for Mr Raab said he had acted ""in the interest of public protection"". This is the first intervention of its kind made by the Justice Secretary after he promised to personally review requests to move high-risk offenders to open prisons. Ling, 23 at the time, stabbed 29-year-old Ms Tulip 60 times at his home, having met her at a pub earlier in the day.    Parole Board papers said the panel assessing his case ""took account of Mr Ling's consistent good behaviour in prison over many years and his good working relationships with professional staff"", noting he had participated in programmes to address his behaviour. They did not think he was suitable for release, but had recommended a move to ""open conditions"", which the justice secretary rejected. Now 47, this was Ling's fourth review before the Parole Board, with a similar request being blocked by Ministry of Justice officials in 2020 when his case last came up. He will be eligible for another parole review in two years' time. Ling was convicted at Newcastle Crown Court and initially ordered to serve at least 20 years in prison, However, the minimum term was reduced to 18 by a High Court judge. Last month Ms Tulip's mother, Doreen Soulsby, said she believed her daughter's killer was still ""a very dangerous man"". She said her family felt ""terrified and devastated"" Ling was even being considered for a move to an open prison. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Putin's Moscow rally and terror in Mariupol: Ukraine war daily round-up,2022-03-18T21:02:02.000Z,"As the war in Ukraine continues, President Vladimir Putin addressed tens of thousands of Russians filling Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium, to celebrate eight years since the annexation of Crimea.  Mr Putin has regularly used the anniversary to highlight love of the motherland. Officials said more than 200,000 people had gathered at the stadium, although the numbers could not be verified. The stadium's official capacity is 81,000, but there were also large crowds outside.

One man who works in the Moscow metro said he and other employees had been forced to attend the rally. ""We know what we have to do next,"" the Russian president told the crowd. ""We'll definitely carry out all the plans we have made.""  But his address on state TV suddenly cut to singer Oleg Gazmanov belting out the words ""Forward, Russia"", in what the Kremlin later called a technical glitch.  In Ukraine itself, the plight of the besieged southern port city of Mariupol was the focus of renewed concern. President Volodymyr Zelensky said 130 survivors had so far been recovered from the basement of a theatre in the city, but hundreds more remained trapped, Civilians were sheltering underground when the theatre was bombed by Russia on Wednesday. The city council said that so far, rescue workers had found one severely injured person, but there were no reports of deaths. Mr Zelensky said Russian shelling prevented the city authorities from establishing effective humanitarian corridors to the besieged city. Mariupol's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, confirmed Russian reports that fighting had reached the centre of the city. ""There's no city centre left. There isn't a small piece of land in the city that doesn't have signs of war,"" he told the BBC.  Overall, however, military analysts say the Russian invaders have made little progress in the past week. Fergal Keane, BBC News, Lviv The first refugees from Mariupol have arrived in Lviv in western Ukraine. The evacuees described scenes of terror in the city, which is under sustained Russian bombardment. ""The city is being wiped off the face of the earth,"" said 28-year-old Yulia Yashenko. Yulia and her elderly parents were among a group of several hundred people who arrived in Lviv on Friday morning. ""Our house was burned by artillery. They fire everything at the city, every weapon is used,"" she said. ""There is black smoke everywhere. There are bodies everywhere and there is nobody to collect them."" Yulia said that, after their home was burned, she and her parents sought safety in the city's theatre for nine days, leaving the day before it was bombed. ""It is only fate that we are alive,"" she says. ""We could have been killed any time. People took us in their car out of the city on the green corridor [humanitarian corridor]. ""It should not be like this. Tell the world what is happening."" Early on Friday, Russian missiles hit an aircraft repair plant near Lviv, a city that has become a safe haven for people fleeing the war. Emergency vehicles raced to the site of the strike, just 6km (four miles) from the city centre, after three loud explosions were heard early on Friday. No-one was reported injured in the attack. It is the closest the conflict has come to Lviv, a key humanitarian supply route and a hub for hundreds of thousands of people who have fled. Elsewhere in Ukraine, a missile strike on an army barracks in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolayiv was reported to have killed more than 40 people. Nearly 100 planes with ties to Russia have been grounded by the US government, including one belonging to billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich. The US Commerce Department has said providing service to these aircraft anywhere in the world - including inside Russia - may lead to heavy fines and potential jail time.

Deepfake presidents used in Russia-Ukraine war,2022-03-18T02:03:34.000Z,"A deepfake video shared on Twitter, appearing to show Russian President Vladimir Putin declaring peace, has resurfaced. Meanwhile, this week Meta and YouTube have taken down a deepfake video of Ukraine's president talking of surrendering to Russia. As both sides use manipulated media, what do these videos reveal about the state of misinformation in the conflict? And are people really believing them? The unconvincing fake of President Zelensky was ridiculed by many Ukrainians. Volodymr Zelensky appears behind a podium, telling Ukrainians to put down their weapons. His head appears too large for and more pixelated than his body - and his voice sounds deeper. In a video posted to his official Instagram account, the real President Zelensky calls it a ""childish provocation"". But the Ukrainian Center for Strategic Communications had warned the Russian government may well use deepfakes to convince Ukrainians to surrender. In a Twitter thread, Meta security-policy head Nathaniel Gleicher said it had ""quickly reviewed and removed"" the deepfake for violating its policy against misleading manipulated media. YouTube also said it had been removed for violating misinformation policies. It had been an easy win for the social-media companies, Nina Schick, author of the book Deepfakes, said, because the video was so crude and easily spotted as fake even by ""semi-sophisticated viewers"". ""The platforms can make a big hoo-ha about dealing with this,"" she said, ""when they aren't doing more on other forms of disinformation.  ""There are so many other forms of disinformation in this war which haven't been debunked.  ""Even though this video was really bad and crude, that won't be the case in the near future."" And it would still ""erode trust in authentic media"". ""People start to believe that everything can be faked,"" Ms Schick said ""It is a new weapon and a potent form of visual disinformation - and anyone can do it."" A deepfake tool letting users animate old photos of relatives has been widely used and the company behind it, MyHeritage, has now added LiveStory, which allows voices to be added. But there was a mixed reaction last year, when South Korean TV network MBN announced it was using a deepfake of newsreader Kim Joo-Ha.  Some were impressed how realistic it was, others concerned the real Kim Joo-Ha would lose her job. Deepfake technology is also being used to create pornography, with a proliferation, in recent years, of websites letting users ""nudify"" pictures. And it can be used for satirical purposes - last year, Channel 4 created a deepfake Queen to deliver an alternative Christmas message. The use of deepfakes in politics remains relatively rare. But a deepfake former US President Barack Obama has been created, to demonstrate the technology's power. ""The Zelensky was a best-case deepfake problem,"" Witness.org. programme director Sam Gregory said.  ""It was not very good, for a start so was easily detected.  ""And it was debunked by Ukraine and Zelensky had rebutted it on social media, so it was an easy policy takedown for Facebook."" But in other parts of the world, journalists and human-rights groups feared they had neither the tools to detect nor the ability to debunk deepfakes. Detection tools analyse the way a person moves or look for things such as the machine-learning process that created the deepfake. But last summer, an online detector suggested a genuine video of a senior politician in Myanmar, apparently confessing to corruption - debate remains over whether it was a real statement or a forced confession - was a deepfake. ""The lack of 100% proof either way and people's desire to believe it was a deepfake reflects the challenges of deepfakes in a real-world environment,"" said Mr Gregory. ""President Putin was made into a deepfake a few weeks ago and it was widely regarded as satire - but there is a thin line between satire and disinformation."" The transcript of Mr Zelensky's deepfake first appeared on the ticker of Ukrainian TV network Ukrayina 24 during a live broadcast on Wednesday. A screenshot and full transcript later appeared on its website. Ukrayina 24 confirmed both website, inaccessible for most of Wednesday, and ticker had been hacked.  The video was then widely shared on Russian-language Telegram and Facebook equivalent VK. From there, it made its way to platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. There have been warnings deepfakes could be dangerous, including in a conflict, for some time. But creating a believable deepfake is costly and time consuming. And old videos and doctored memes remain the most common and effective misinformation tactic in this war. Neither well made nor believable, the Zelensky deepfake is among the worst I've seen. But the fact a deepfake has now been made and shared during a war is notable.  The next one may not be as bad.

P&O Ferry customers face stressful changes,2022-03-18T13:49:22.000Z,"People travelling with P&O Ferries have been warned of ""significant disruption"" to their journeys, after the company announced it was laying off 800 workers. Frustrated customers have spoken to the BBC about cancelled trips, last-minute texts, and their anger over the treatment of employees. John and Helen Carson were in a rush when they picked up the phone. They were trying to get to John's brother's funeral in Northern Ireland. The couple, from Leamington Spa, had planned to sail with P&O Ferries from Scotland to Northern Ireland on Friday, arriving a day early to spend precious time with their family. But, as they drove into Gretna Green at 5pm on Thursday, they received a text from P&O saying their ferry was cancelled. They were suddenly faced with the prospect of missing the funeral.  ""We were panicking, you know?"" says John, 65. ""We were on the computer all last night trying to get flights."" P&O Ferries staff protest over shock firing They booked one that leaves London's Heathrow Airport at 6:40am on Saturday, and were on their way back to Leamington Spa to catch a few hours of sleep. They have been unable to contact P&O Ferries, and hope they can get a refund for their Â£320 crossing - especially as they have spent about Â£600 on transport, hotels and the new flights. ""When you think about the fact that we're going over there to bury my brother and the way they've treated us,"" says John. ""The stress and anxiety we faced last night."" ""What they've done to their poor staff is disgraceful and beyond comprehension,"" he adds. Ryan Fuller, from Gosport, works for a haulage company - and is due to drive a six tonne shipment of aid to Ukrainian refugees on the Romanian border on Saturday. But he fears he will not make it as he and his brother are booked on a P&O ferry. ""All was going to plan until P&O decided to do what they did, which has caused a bit of chaos,"" he tells the BBC. Their shipment is made up of donations collected by a local company, and includes food, clothes and toiletries.  ""Hopefully we'll get down there,"" he says. ""Especially with the Russian attack outside Lviv, we really need to get the aid out to that border."" Cathy Hunt, from Ilkley, had planned to travel with P&O Ferries this summer, but has cancelled her return ticket and opted to go with a different ferry company. ""We're supposed to be going on this holiday which was booked three years ago,"" she tells BBC Radio 5 live, adding that the pandemic has prevented her from travelling. ""This is the third time we've tried to go."" ""How they can treat their employees like this? It's just abhorrent,"" she says. ""I'm not spending my hard-earned money on a company that behaved like that."" P&O Ferries said on Thursday that the decision to lay off 800 workers was ""tough"" but the business would not be viable without ""making swift and significant changes now"". It said it had made a Â£100m loss year-on-year, which has been covered by its parent company, DP World.   Announcing the job losses, it said: ""This is not sustainable. Without these changes there is no future for P&O Ferries."" The company has told clients the changes will allow it to provide ""a better service to our customers across the tourism and freight industries"". It warned of ""significant disruption"" over the coming days, but said it was working ""to minimise the impact on your journey"".  It has apologised to customers on social media. Ben Nicholson, from Workington, is a promotions manager for darts events. He travels on a darts mini cruise from Hull to Rotterdam twice a year with P&O ferries - a trip where darts fans get a chance to play with professionals. He was meant to join the next trip in December, but will no longer go because of what he says is ""disgusting"" treatment of staff. ""They're all absolutely fantastic, they work really hard,"" he says, adding that captains even sometimes posed for photographs with players. ""It's an entertainment ferry so they're not just there to transport passengers, there's a show to put on."" He says he will be open to opportunities to work with other ferry companies instead. ""Even if P&O turn around and say 'we still want to carry on'... we will not support it,"" he says. ""As a promoter and a darts fan I would not ever support it again.""

Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal?,2022-03-25T12:36:51.000Z,"The transport secretary has called for the boss of P&O to resign after the sacking of nearly 800 staff without notice  Grant Shapps has called Peter Hebblethwaite's actions outrageous, and said that the government would force the company to u-turn. Mr Hebblethwaite admitted to a committee of MPs yesterday that he had not consulted his employees in advance, or their representatives, and admitted that this was against the law. ""There's absolutely no doubt that we were required to consult with the unions - we chose not to do that,"" he told MPs. He said that the sacked employees would be compensated ""in full"", with a package worth Â£36.5m - 40 employees woul get more than Â£100,000 and nobody would be paid less than Â£15,000. Not consulting on cuts broke law, P&O boss admits Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that the company had also broken the law by failing to give the government 45 days' notice of its actions.  However, lawyers addressing MPs on Thursday suggested the prime minister was mistaken.  Doubt over PM claim that P&O sackings may be illegal Changes to the law made in in 2018 stated that if the ship on which the employees were working was registered in another country, the management had to inform the authorities in the country where it was registered - not the country where it was operating.  P&O has ships registered in Cyprus, the Bahamas and Bermuda.  In a letter to the government, Mr Hebblethwaite said: ""The very clear statutory obligation in this case was... to notify the competent authority of the state where the vessel is registered"" and said that had been done on 17 March.  Mr Hebblethwaite re-stated this point in person to MPs on the House of Commons Transport Committee, although he did not explain how the company had complied with it.  Cypriot authorities need to be given at least 45 days' notice to make more than 100 redundancies. In Bermuda and the Bahamas, 30 days' notice is required. Lawyers have also questioned whether P&O did in fact give the necessary notice to these authorities. Under UK law, employers planning to make 20 or more staff redundant within any 90-day period, must first consult staff and speak to trade union representatives. If this doesn't happen, employees are entitled to take their employer to a tribunal. Rosemary Connolly, an employment solicitor, says it appears P&O set aside the consultation phase and moved to terminate workers, as the process of consultation ""ordinarily takes quite a lot of time"". ""If consultation is going to be meaningful it needs to be a proper exchange,"" she says. She believes that P&O staff who have been sacked, might be able to argue that their dismissal was unfair and make a claim. Government guidance: Redundancy and benefitsWhat are my rights if I am made redundant? Kate Palmer, HR advice director at Peninsula, agrees.  ""There has been no meaningful consultation at all. It should be two-way process where the employees have the opportunity to put forward alternatives to that enforced termination and none of that has happened. So is it a fair process? No, based on that alone."" Ms Connolly says a problem in such cases is that any action by the workers is ""very much after the horse has bolted"". Staff would have to wait months on average for an outcome. She points out staff would have no jobs potentially during the claim period and would have to pay legal costs even if they win their case, although unions might help with those. Staff are also being asked to sign forms that will prevent them taking legal action if they accept compensation from P&O. However, the fact that P&O's owners, DP World, are based in Dubai, should not affect employees making a case for wrongful dismissal, according to Ms Connolly.  She says that under UK employment law, workers' rights are based on the ""jurisdiction from which you work"" - in other words, because they work in the UK, they are covered by UK law. If this wasn't the case, she says, companies could just register themselves abroad and employment law could be ignored.  P&O says that the decision was taken ""as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options"" because the company could not have survived otherwise.  Mr Hebblethwaite told MPs that the company needed to move to ""a competitive operating model that is recognised throughout the world and our competitors also use"". Earlier, union representatives told the committee that Irish Ferries had also previously moved to hiring cheaper foreign staff, but that the unions still had good agreements with Stena and DFDS. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC News that ""Irish Ferries already went down this route"" and warned that the company ""will have to change their operating model""."

Ukraine: What have been Russia's military mistakes?,2022-03-19T00:32:59.000Z,"Russia has one of the largest and most powerful armed forces in the world, but that has not been apparent in its initial invasion of Ukraine. Many military analysts in the West have been surprised by its performance on the battlefield so far, with one describing it as ""dismal"".   Its military advances appear to have largely stalled and some now question whether it can recover from the losses it has suffered. This week, a senior Nato military official told the BBC, ""the Russians clearly have not achieved their goals and probably will not at the end of the day"". So what has gone wrong? I have spoken to senior Western military officers and intelligence officials, about the mistakes Russia has made. Russia's first mistake was to underestimate the strength of resistance and the capabilities of Ukraine's own smaller armed forces. Russia has an annual defence budget of more than $60bn, compared with Ukraine's spending of just over $4bn.    At the same time, Russia, and many others, appear to have overestimated its own military strengths. President Putin had embarked on an ambitious modernisation programme for his military and he too may have believed his own hype.   A senior British military official said much of Russia's investment had been spent on its vast nuclear arsenal and experimentation, that included developing new weapons such as hypersonic missiles. Russia is supposed to have built the world's most advanced tank - the T-14 Armata. But while it has been seen on Moscow's Victory Day Parade on Red Square, it has been missing in battle. Most of what Russia has fielded are older T-72 tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and rocket launchers.   At the start of the invasion Russia had a clear advantage in the air, with the combat aircraft it had moved near the border outnumbering Ukraine's air force by more than three to one. Most military analysts assumed the invading force would quickly gain superiority in the air, but it has not. Ukraine's air defences are still proving effective, limiting Russia's ability to manoeuvre.  Moscow may have also assumed its special forces would play an important role, helping deliver a quick, decisive blow. A senior Western intelligence official told the BBC that Russia thought it could deploy lighter, spearhead units like the Spetsnatz and VDV paratroopers, ""to eliminate a small number of defenders and that would be it"". But in the first few days their helicopter assault on Hostomel Airport, just outside Kyiv, was repelled, denying Russia an airbridge to bring in troops, equipment and supplies.   Instead, Russia has had to transport its supplies mostly by road. This has created traffic jams and choke points which are easy targets for Ukrainian forces to ambush. Some heavy armour has gone off road, only to get stuck in mud, reinforcing an image of an army that has become ""bogged down"". Meanwhile, Russia's long armoured column from the north that was captured by satellites has still failed to encircle Kyiv. The most significant advances have come from the south, where it has been able to use rail lines to resupply its forces. The UK Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, told the BBC that President Putin's forces ""have lost the momentum"". ""They're stuck and they are slowly but surely taking significant casualties."" Russia had amassed a force of around 190,000 troops for this invasion and most of those have already been committed to the battle. But they have already lost about 10% of that force. There are no reliable figures for the scale of either Russian or Ukrainian losses. Ukraine claims to have killed 14,000 Russian troops, though the US estimates it is probably half that number.   Western officials say there is also evidence of dwindling morale among Russian fighters, with one saying it was ""very, very, low"". Another said the troops were ""cold, tired and hungry"" as they had already been waiting in the snow for weeks in Belarus and Russia before they were given the order to invade.   Russia has already been forced to look for more troops to make up for its losses, including moving in reserve units from as far afield as the east of the country and Armenia. Western officials believe it is also ""highly likely"" that foreign troops from Syria will soon join the fight, along with mercenaries from its secretive Wagner group. A senior Nato military official said this was a sign it was ""scratching the bottom of the barrel"".  Russia has struggled with the basics. There is an old military saying that amateurs talk tactics while professionals study logistics. There is evidence that Russia has not given it enough consideration. Armoured columns have run out of fuel, food and ammunition. Vehicles have broken down and been left abandoned, then towed away by Ukrainian tractors.   Western officials also believe Russia may be running low on some munitions. It has already fired between 850 and 900 long-range precision munitions, including cruise missiles, which are harder to replace than unguided weapons. US officials have warned Russia has approached China to help address some of its shortages.     In contrast, there has been a steady flow of Western-supplied weapons going into Ukraine, which has been a boost for its morale. The US has just announced it will be providing an additional $800m in defence support. As well as more anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, it is expected to include Switchblade, which is a small, US-developed, ""kamikaze"" drone that can be carried in a backpack before being launched to deliver a small explosive at targets on the ground.   Western officials still warn that President Putin could ""double down with greater brutality"". They say he still has enough firepower to bombard Ukrainian cities for a ""considerable period of time"".  Despite the setbacks, one intelligence official said President Putin was, ""unlikely to be deterred and may instead escalate. He likely remains confident that Russia can militarily defeat Ukraine"". And while the Ukrainian forces have shown fierce resistance, that same official warned that without significant resupplies they too could ""eventually be spent in terms of ammunition and numbers"". The odds may be better than when the war first started, but they still seem stacked against Ukraine.

War in Ukraine: Gordon Brown backs Nuremberg-style trial for Putin,2022-03-19T10:24:33.000Z,"Gordon Brown and Sir John Major want a new international tribunal to be set up to investigate Vladimir Putin for his actions in Ukraine. The former PMs are among 140 academics, lawyers and politicians to sign a petition calling for a legal system modelled on the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals after World War Two. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is already investigating Mr Putin for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. But some say its powers are limited. The ICC cannot pursue the crime of aggression without a referral from the UN security council, which Russia could veto. What is a war crime and could Putin be prosecuted?Russia faces war crimes investigation over Ukraine Former Labour Prime Minister Mr Brown told the BBC that since the fall of the Berlin Wall ""we've assumed that democracy and the rule of law will prevail"", but that Mr Putin ""is replacing that by the use of force"".  ""If the message is not sent out now then we face aggression in other countries which may go unpunished as well,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. Asked if he considered the Russian president to be a war criminal, he replied: ""That's what President Biden said, and that's my view."" US President Joe Biden this week called Mr Putin a ""war criminal"" for the first time. The Kremlin denounced the comments as ""unacceptable and unforgiveable rhetoric"". Other leaders to accuse Russia of carrying out war crimes include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and current UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Brown said the war had seen the indiscriminate bombing of civilians, which is against international law, as well as breaches of humanitarian ceasefires and ""nuclear blackmail"".  LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyANALYSIS: Russia 'tightening the noose' around MariupolRUSSIA: Putin lays out his demandsWATCH: On the front line with Ukraine's armyIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflict Russian forces have bombed civilian areas in a number of cities in Ukraine. On Wednesday a theatre where hundreds of civilians were sheltering was hit in the besieged south eastern city of Mariupol. And Ukraine has also called Russia's air strike on Mariupol's hospital a war crime. A warning should be sent out that Mr Putin ""will face the full force of international law"" said Mr Brown, adding that the Ukrainian government was asking for such a move. It is hoped the tribunal will act in addition to the ICC's current investigations into war crimes. The campaign has already been backed by 740,000 people - including dozens of public figures. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and the former president of the UK Supreme Court Lady Hale have added their signatures to the petition - as have professor of international law Philippe Sands QC, former prosecutor for the Nuremberg Military Tribunal Benjamin Ferencz, Labour peer Helena Kennedy QC and former president of the European Court of Human Rights Sir Nicolas Bratza. Writing in the Daily Mail, Mr Brown said creating a new tribunal would close off this ""loophole"" in international law ""that Putin could use to dodge justice"". ""We must move with speed, to assure the people of Ukraine that we are committed to action and not just warm words - and we must make Putin's collaborators aware that the noose is tightening. If they do not distance themselves from Putin, they face prosecution and prison,"" Mr Brown wrote. The Nuremberg trials - named after the German city they were held in - were the first ever international war crime trials and saw the most notorious Nazis tried for their crimes. The offences included waging a war of aggression, violating the customs of warfare and committing crimes against humanity. Mr Brown continued: ""From Britain - which rightly prides itself on democracy and the rule of law - the message must go out. At Nuremberg we held the Nazi war criminals to account. Eight decades on, we must ensure there will be a day of reckoning for Putin."" Ukrainian MP Dmytro Gurin told the BBC he was sceptical about whether the proposal would actually lead to a trial for Mr Putin. ""You have to catch him first,"" he said. ""The tribunal, it's a nice idea when they happen and all the European countries like Great Britain and America we thank you for all your help, but you know, we are at a totally different stage of war now. ""When this war started it was just a conditional war - army against army - and now we don't have a conditional war, we have mass murder in the last two weeks."" Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have been taking place - but UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned that the Kremlin might be using the negotiations as a ""smokescreen"". In an interview with the Times newspaper, she said: ""If a country is serious about negotiations, it doesn't indiscriminately bomb civilians that day.""  Meanwhile, Conservative MP Johnny Mercer revealed on Friday that he recently travelled to Ukraine, where he witnessed ""total carnage"" alongside demonstrations of ""incredible human spirit"". The Army veteran, who travelled to the capital Kyiv, tweeted photographs of himself visiting injured people in hospital. He wrote in the Daily Telegraph that he decided to travel to Ukraine after being invited by a former MP in the Donetsk region. Government advice warns against travelling to the country. Mr Mercer told The Times: ""I didn't tell anyone, I just disappeared. I decided it was the right thing to do."" The UK government has said that two million medical items have been donated to Ukraine, including painkillers, insulin shots and intensive care equipment.  A convoy of 18 fire engines set off from Kent on Saturday, bound for Ukraine. The engines - along with thousands of pieces of equipment - have been donated by fire services from across the UK.   And former prime minister David Cameron is on his way to Poland to deliver donations to Ukrainian refugees.  He is joining an Oxfordshire food project which is taking a lorry filled with items such as clothes and first aid kits to the country.

UK City of Culture 2025 shortlist revealed,2022-03-18T22:54:20.000Z,"Bradford, County Durham, Southampton and Wrexham have made the shortlist to be named UK City of Culture for 2025. A different location is given the title every four years. The winning place will be announced in May and will be the fourth holder, after Derry-Londonderry, Hull and the current City of Culture, Coventry. The title has brought Â£172m to Coventry, according to the government, as well as events like BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend and the Turner Prize. ""We have seen a huge positive impact in this year's host city, Coventry, with millions of pounds in investment and thousands of visitors,"" said Arts Minister Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay. The government said the finalists would have to show how they would use culture ""to transform a place through social, cultural and economic regeneration"" and recover from the Covid pandemic. For the first time, groups of towns, areas and counties have been able to bid, as well as single urban areas. The four locations that missed out on progressing from the longlist were Cornwall, Derby, Stirling and a bid covering Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon. The city with the youngest population in the UK, Bradford says winning would ""leave a lasting legacy of increased visitor numbers and a more vibrant, sustainable cultural sector"". It would also increase opportunities for local people and ""bring greater community engagement across the district and celebrate our diverse communities"", the bid says. Bradford 2025 organisers have already backed a string of events in West Yorkshire that they say give a glimpse of what to expect, such as a new public artwork programme, a light festival visited by more than 20,000 people in November, and mentoring network FilmMakers 2025. Claims to fame: David Hockney, Bad Boy Chiller Crew, National Science and Media Museum. County Durham includes the towns of Bishop Auckland and Barnard Castle as well as Durham. It says being UK City of Culture would attract 15 million visitors, spending Â£700m and creating 2,500 jobs in the creative industries and 1,800 in tourism. It would also ""empower residents and help to improve community well-being"" and ""strengthen our reputation nationally and internationally as a place to live, work, visit and invest"", organisers promise. The year would include spectacular opening and closing events, the bicentenary of the world's first public steam railway, a travelling fair asking ""big questions"" about the local economy, and a 12-month space programme. Claims to fame: Rowan Atkinson, Mark Gatiss, The Auckland Project. The south-coast city is ""uniquely positioned, facing outwards to the world"", it boasts. Its bid organisers say the contest is ""a real chance to put our city on the map - to change perceptions, showcase our diversity and give a voice to every part of our community"". They say: ""If our bid wins, we'll attract visitors, enterprise and trade that will boost our own homegrown businesses and cultural organisations, bring in investment and boost opportunities for young people. We'll get the support we need to tackle the challenges we face, too."" Claims to fame: Craig David, Chris Packham, SeaCity Museum. Covering Wrexham and the surrounding area, the borough would be the first Welsh UK City of Culture. It says success would allow ""communities that don't usually have a platform to share their stories"". If it wins, it says it ""will explore how culture can reanimate our public spaces and shopping areas, and work on how we can best upgrade our civic and artistic infrastructure"". It wants to use the bid to become known as the ""capital of play for the UK"", it pledges ""a world-class events programme"" and to use culture ""as a catalyst for improving health and well-being, local knowledge and pride, and improved educational outcomes"".

Assad: Syria's leader makes historic visit to UAE,2022-03-19T03:16:30.000Z,"Syria's president has made his first trip to an Arab country since the Syrian civil war began 11 years ago. Bashar al-Assad arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Friday, and met several influential and controversial rulers who signalled a willingness to strengthen ties with Syria again. It marks a potential warming in Syria's relations with its Arab neighbours, which had previously isolated Mr Assad. But the US criticised the trip, saying it was ""profoundly disappointed"". Among the Emiratis Mr Assad met was the billionaire ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, who has been embroiled in a number of controversies recently. One of his 25 children, Latifa, has previously said she was being held hostage and feared for her life after trying to escape Dubai in 2018. And late last year, he settled a Â£500m ($660m) divorce case with one of his six wives, Princess Haya Bint Al-Hussain, who fled to Britain in 2019 and spent huge sums on personal security after receiving threatening messages and having her phone hacked, according to court documents. Princess Latifa: The Dubai ruler's daughter who vanishedThe princess, the sheikh and the Â£550m divorce settlement Mr Assad also travelled to the UAE's capital city, Abu Dhabi, to meet with Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. According to Emirati state media, he ""stressed that Syria is a fundamental pillar of Arab security, and that the UAE is keen to strengthen cooperation with it"". The leaders reportedly discussed how the UAE could provide political and humanitarian support for Syria, as well as how to promote economic trade between the nations. President Assad was also photographed with the owner of Manchester City Football Club, Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Syria's president has made few international trips since his country's long and bloody civil war began in March 2011, which the United Nations says has so far killed 350,000 people. Until now Mr Assad had only left the war-torn country to visit Russia and Iran, both military backers of his regime. The US said it was ""profoundly disappointed and troubled"" by the UAE's decision to welcome Mr Assad.  The US is against efforts to normalise relations with the Syrian leader until progress is made resolving the civil war. United Arab Emirates profileSyria country profile Bashar al-Assad: Facing down rebellion ""We urge states considering engagement with the Assad regime to weigh carefully the horrific atrocities visited by the regime on the Syrians over the last decade,"" said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price. Along with the majority of Arab states, the UAE broke ties with Syria soon after the civil war erupted - and once backed rebel fighters in its attempts to overthrow Mr Assad's regime. But in recent years relations between the two countries have gradually improved, with the UAE spearheading efforts to bring Syria back into the Arab fold despite protests from Washington. In 2018 the UAE reopened its embassy in Syria's capital, Damascus, and in November last year, diplomats were sent there to there to meet President Assad.   Even if gradual, any improvement of ties with a wealthy Gulf neighbour would be a boost to Mr Assad's government, which has been crippled by Western sanctions and international isolation."
UK's safe level for tap water too high - scientists,2022-03-19T01:00:38.000Z,"Scientists are concerned that the allowable levels of toxic PFAS - known as ""forever chemicals"" - in UK drinking water are too high.  A BBC study found PFAS levels exceeded European safety levels in almost half of the samples taken. However, none exceeded the current UK safety level. The chemicals are in many products such as non-stick pans, food packaging, carpets, furniture, firefighting foam. They have been linked to a range of diseases, including cancer. Guidelines from the UK Drinking Water Inspectorate state drinking water must contain PFAS chemicals at no more than 100 nanograms per litre (ng/l). Above that, action must be taken to reduce levels. Working with the University of Greenwich and Manchester Metropolitan University, the BBC took 45 tap water samples. Laboratory analysis found that none exceeded the 100ng/l level. But 25 samples did contain PFASs, and four had levels that exceeded 10ng/l, which, under the current guidelines, means local healthcare professionals must be consulted, and levels monitored. And almost half of the samples exceeded the European Food Standards Agency tolerable limit of 2.2ng/l. Race to replace persistent chemicals in our homesToxic 'forever chemicals' found in British otters Professor Roger Klein, a chemist and PFAS expert, said: ""The significance of your results, even though they're small, is that it underlines that this stuff is everywhere and that it's in drinking water. ""It's ridiculous that the UK Drinking Water Inspectorate has a level of 100ng/l before action is taken.""  Rita Lock-Caruso, Professor of toxicology at the University of Michigan, also said the results raised a potential health concern: ""We're finding health effects at lower and lower concentrations - in the single digits."" Research has found the most common PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, have probable links to high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, and pregnancy-induced hypertension.     There is particular concern about the effect on children. Professor Philippe Grandjean, of Harvard University, said: ""A woman may build this up in her body and when she gets pregnant, she shares that with her foetus. She eliminates part of her body burden into her milk. So, the next generation will get a huge dose, and the baby may end up having up to 10 times as much PFAS in the blood as her mother has."" The US is considering reducing its regulatory level, from 70ng/l. ""We are beginning to think that there's no such thing as a safe level and we want them to be as low as possible, because water is not the only source of exposure,"" said former head of the National Institute of Environmental Sciences, Linda Birnbaum. However, there is little public data about its presence or impacts in the UK. Some residents on the Channel Island of Jersey believe they are suffering adverse health impacts from drinking water contaminated with PFAS. In the 1990s the government of Jersey discovered PFAS had polluted St Ouen's Bay aquifer, which was used by locals for drinking water. After years of local lobbying, the government of Jersey has recently agreed to offer free blood tests for people with health issues in the area. ""I have an autoimmune disease, my father has kidney disease, and my mother has thyroid disease,"" says Sarah Simon, a lifelong Jersey resident turned citizen scientist.  ""When I started talking to our neighbours, I found that many of the men had kidney stones and the women had thyroid disease. This can't be a coincidence.""   PFOS and PFOA has been restricted and neither are manufactured in the UK now. However, there are still a raft of other PFASs which are still being used and aren't regulated.   The BBC study found 18 different types of PFAS chemicals in the tap water samples. In a statement, the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs said: ""We have robust systems in place to identify the impact of a range of chemicals on the environment and human health and are working closely with regulators to better assess the presence of PFAS in our natural environment and their sources.""

Ukraine war: Putin has redrawn the world - but not the way he wanted,2022-03-19T00:33:33.000Z,"Vladimir's Putin's invasion of Ukraine has changed the world. We are living in new and more dangerous times - the post-Cold War era that began with the fall of the Berlin Wall is over. It is a rare thing to live through a moment of huge historical consequence and understand in real time that is what it is.  In November 1989, I stood on a snow-flecked Wenceslas Square in Prague, the capital of what was then Czechoslovakia, and watched a new world being born. The peoples of Communist Eastern Europe had risen in defiance of their dictatorships. The Berlin Wall had been torn down. A divided Europe was being made whole again. In Prague, the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel addressed a crowd of 400,000 from a second-floor balcony. It was an exhilarating moment, dizzying in its pace. That evening, the Communist regime collapsed and within weeks Havel was president of a new democratic state. I sensed, even at the time, that I had watched the world pivot - that it was one of those rare moments when you know the world is remaking itself before your eyes. How many such moments had there been in the history of Europe since the French Revolution? Probably, I thought then, about five. This, 1989, was the sixth. But that world - born in those dramatic popular revolutions - came to an end when Putin ordered Russian forces into Ukraine. The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called this moment a zeitenwende - a turning point - while UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said it was a ""paradigm shift"". The age of complacency, she said, was over. 1789: French Revolution. Monarchy overthrown, republic founded1815: Congress of Vienna redraws map of Europe, restores balance of power and ushers in decades of peace after the upheaval of the Napoleonic wars1848: A wave of liberal and democratic revolutions across Europe1919: Treaty of Versailles. New independent sovereign nation states replace old multi-national empires1945: Yalta - great powers agree to partition Europe into Western and Soviet ""spheres of influence"". Iron Curtain falls across the continent1989: Democratic revolutions in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe tear down the Iron Curtain. The Soviet Union collapses two years later. Vladimir Putin calls this the ""greatest catastrophe of the 20th Century"" Quentin Sommerville, one of the BBC's most experienced war reporters walked through the wreckage in Kharkiv recently and said of the Russian bombardment: ""If these tactics are unfamiliar to you, then you haven't been paying attention."" He should know, he spent enough time under Russian rockets in Syria to be paying very close attention. But the governments of the democratic world - how much attention have they been paying to the nature of the Putin regime? The evidence has been building for years. Two decades have passed since he sent troops into Georgia claiming he was supporting breakaway regions. Later, he sent spies into British cities armed with nerve agents to murder exiled Russians. In 2014, he invaded Eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Ukraine war: Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway 'If these tactics are unfamiliar to you, then you haven't been paying attention''Suburban gardens have become battlefields from Europe's past'  Despite all this, Germany, and much of the EU, were locking themselves into an unhealthy dependence on Russian gas. A year after the annexation of Crimea, they approved the building of a new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, to boost supplies. The ""complacency"" Liz Truss refers to also indicts her own country. London has been a safe haven for Russian money since John Major was prime minister. Russian oligarchs have parked billions here, laundered their money, bought up the most prestigious private homes in the capital, socialised with politicians and donated to their campaign funds. Few questions were asked about where their vast wealth, acquired so suddenly, had come from. So, no. The Western democracies have not been ""paying attention"" to the nature of the menace that has been incubating on their eastern frontier. But Putin, too, has seemed complacent. First, he believed the West was in chronic decline, weakened by internal division and ideological rancour. The election of Donald Trump and Brexit he saw as proof of this. The rise of right-wing authoritarian governments in Poland and Hungary was further evidence of the disintegration of liberal values and institutions. The US's humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan was proof of a waning power withdrawing from the world stage. Second, he misread what was happening on his borders. He refused to believe that a series of democratic uprisings in former Soviet Republics - Georgia (2003), Ukraine (2004-5) and Kyrgyzstan (2005) - could possibly be authentic expressions of the popular will. Because each was aimed at removing corrupt and unpopular pro-Moscow governments, it seemed self-evident to the Kremlin that these were the work of foreign intelligence agencies, the Americans and the British in particular - Western imperialism's forward march into territory that was rightfully and historically Russia's. Third, he has failed to understand his own armed forces. It is clear now that he expected this ""special military operation"" to be over in a few days. Russia's military incompetence has astonished many Western security experts. It brings echoes for me of a smaller, more containable, but nonetheless devastating war, in former Yugoslavia. In 1992, Serb nationalists launched a war to strangle the newly independent state of Bosnia at birth. They argued that Bosnian identity was bogus, that Bosnian statehood had no historical legitimacy, that it was really part of Serbia. It is exactly Putin's view of Ukraine. Like Russia today, Serb forces enjoyed overwhelming firepower superiority. But they often stalled wherever local non-Serbs put up resistance. They seemed unable to seize towns or cities - unwilling to fight street-by-street on foot. The Bosnian defenders were initially very poorly equipped - I remember boys in tennis shoes in the trenches of Sarajevo with one AK-47 between three of them. But they defended their capital for nearly four years. There is a similar resolve in the young men volunteering to defend Kyiv. So instead of taking the cities and towns, the Serbs laid siege to them - surrounding them, bombarding them, cutting off water, gas and electricity. It is already happening in Mariupol. Besiege a city and cut off its water supply, and within 24 hours, every toilet is a public health hazard. Citizens have to go out into the streets to find water standpipes and fill up receptacles just to flush their loos. Cut off the electricity and you freeze in your own home. Soon the food runs out. Is that what the Russians intend for Mariupol, for Kharkiv, for Kyiv? To starve them into submission? But nearly four years of this cruelty gave Bosnian nationhood a founding narrative of resistance, suffering and heroic struggle. Ukraine's identity, too, will be strengthened further by the way Ukrainians have fought. Ukraine's Russian speakers have not felt ""liberated"" by the invasion. The evidence is that they, too, believe in Ukraine as a sovereign state. Putin's war, aimed at reunifying what he sees as two parts of the Russian nation, is already having the opposite effect - strengthening the will of most Ukrainians to seek a destiny free from Russian domination. In 1994, while the war in the Balkans was still raging, the rest of Eastern Europe was looking to the future - each nation eager to take what it saw as its natural place in a Europe of independent sovereign states at peace with each other. But it was still far from certain that any of them would be allowed to join Nato. There was a debate, back then, about whether a third security block should be formed by the newly-liberated East European nations, to act as a buffer between Nato and Russia. Russia was weak in the 1990s, and the nations that had endured Soviet occupation for 40 years did not trust it to stay weak for long. In the end, they wanted nothing short of Nato membership. Under President Bill Clinton, the US pressed ahead with Nato expansion. The Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who saw himself as a loyal ally of Clinton's, was said to be furious when he found out - at a press conference - that Nato was planning to admit new members without consulting Moscow. And the tearing down of the Iron Curtain had raised a new question in geopolitics - how far east does the Western world extend? I was commissioned by the BBC to take a road trip through Poland, Belarus and Ukraine to address the question, ""Where is the eastern edge of the Western world now?"" I went to the hunting lodge in Belarus where, in late 1991, the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, had met his counterparts from Ukraine and Belarus. Here, they agreed to recognise each other's Soviet Republics as independent nation-states. They then rang the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and informed him that the country of which he was head of state - the Soviet Union - no longer existed. It was a moment fraught with both danger and opportunity. For Belarus and Ukraine, it was the chance to liberate themselves from Moscow rule - domination by Russian imperialism in both its Tsarist and Soviet forms. For Yeltsin, it represented the chance to liberate Russia too - from its historic role as an imperial power. The UK and France had both ceased to be imperial powers after World War Two - as Austria had done after WW1. In Turkey, Kemal Ataturk had built a modern European secular republic - a Turkish nation-state - after the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire had been defeated and dismembered in 1918. Could Boris Yeltsin do the same thing - build a modern Russian nation-state, at peace with its sovereign neighbours, on the ruins of the Soviet Empire? In the early 1990s, he began his Westernising experiment, to try to turn an imperial power into a democratic state. But the rush - encouraged by the Western democracies eager for investment opportunities - to turn a sclerotic, state-owned command economy into a free-market system was disastrous. It created gangster capitalism. A tiny elite became fabulously rich by plundering the assets of the major industries - especially oil and gas. The wheels finally came off the experiment in 1998. The economy collapsed, the rouble lost two-thirds of its value in a month and inflation hit 80%. I stood with a middle-aged couple in a queue at a Moscow bank. They wanted to take their money out in dollars or pounds - anything other than roubles. The queue was long and slow-moving and, every few minutes, a bank employee changed the displayed exchange rate, as the rouble plunged further. People could see their life savings dropping in value by the minute. The couple got close to the head of the queue when suddenly the shutters came down - there was no cash left. I went to a former coal-mining region near the Ukraine border, where the mines were barely functioning. I met a graduate mining engineer who had lost his job - a man in his 30s with a young family. He took me to his dacha outside the city, which had about an acre of land. ""About 80% of what my family eat in the year,"" he said. ""I grow on this patch of land. The rest, like coffee and sugar, I barter for. I haven't used or even seen cash in about 18 months."" Nothing spoke more powerfully about Yeltsin's failure to transform Russia than the sight of this highly educated man digging for his own dinner. ""Stalin turned a nation of peasants into an industrial superpower in a generation. Yeltsin is doing the same thing in reverse,"" he told me. Ordinary Russians felt robbed. The great westernising experiment had been a con trick that had enriched a criminalised elite and impoverished everyone else. Many of the reports we filed from Russia at that time boiled down to a single question: ""What are the political consequences of the profound disenchantment that Russians now feel?"" The answer was that Russia, eventually, would revert to type - a retreat from democracy and a return to authoritarian rule. A retreat from nation-statehood and return to a more assertive imperial attitude to its ""near abroad"" - the countries that had previously been part of the Soviet Union. The former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski famously said that Russia could be a democracy or an empire, but it could not be both. The Russian emblem, the double-headed eagle, looks both east and west. History has pulled Russia in opposing directions - democratic nation statehood in one direction, domineering imperial power in the other. Go to St Petersburg and you will see another aspect of this dual character. It is the country's beautiful bay window on the Gulf of Finland. It is an 18th Century city, facing west. It is the European Enlightenment in architectural form. Under the Tsars it was the imperial capital. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks moved the capital back to Moscow and power retreated behind the high, crenellated walls of the Kremlin. It is the architecture of defensiveness, of suspicion, even fear. When Russian leaders look west from here, they see flat open countryside rolling away to the south and west for hundreds of miles. There are no natural frontiers. When I was the BBC's Moscow correspondent in the late 1990s, there was a driver who could remember, as a boy, seeing German troops on the outskirts of Moscow in the 1940s. Every time he took us to Sheremetyevo Airport, we would pass a monument designed to look like metal anti-tank defences - so-called Czech hedgehogs - and he would say: ""This is how close they came, the Germans."" Napoleon's army had gone further the previous century. That experience - that chronic sense of an insecure western frontier - informs the way Russian leaders have thought about their ""near abroad"". In another conversation about the ""near abroad"", a friend recited a rhyming couplet to me. In Russian it rhymes nicely, but in English it goes: ""A chicken's not really a bird; and Poland's not really abroad."" Russia's sense of what it is entitled to in the lands to its west penetrates popular consciousness, too. I will borrow an anecdote from another friend in Moscow at the time. The same driver picked her up from the airport and asked her where she had been. ""I've been for a weekend in Prague,"" she said. ""Oh Prague,"" came the reply. ""That's good. That's ours."" But it wasn't. The Berlin Wall had come down nine years earlier and the nations of Eastern Europe had ceased being ""ours"". Except Ukraine. Putin regards it not as a neighbouring country, but as the frontier land of Russia itself - and he wants it brought back into the Russian fold. What would it take to do that? How can a nation that has put up so unified a resistance be subdued? Almost certainly he has overreached himself. Several factors must now be alarming him. The first is the state of his own armed forces. The second is the resilience of the Ukrainian defence. Did Putin really expect the Russian-speaking people of Ukraine to welcome his troops as liberators? Did he really believe that the uprising of 2014 - which replaced the pro-Moscow government with one oriented to the West - was all a Western plot? If he did, then it reveals how little the Kremlin understands about its ""near abroad"". But his biggest miscalculation has been to underestimate the resolve of the West. And this is what makes 2022 one of those pivotal years - the zeitenwende, in the words of Chancellor Scholz. Almost overnight, Germany has transformed its attitude to its role in the world. Traditionally reluctant - for sound historical reasons - to throw its weight around, it had preferred the exercise of soft power to hard. Not now. It has announced a doubling of defence spending, and is sending lethal weapons to Ukraine. Gone, too, is the ostpolitik - the decades-old German policy of seeking peace through engagement, especially trade. Germany, along with the rest of the democratic world, will now move to end its dependence on Russian gas. The Nord Stream 2 project is suspended - though not yet scrapped. We are seeing a root-and-branch redrawing of the map of global energy distribution, aimed at cutting Russia out of it. Russia is highly integrated into the global economy. But now it has been expelled from the system the world uses to exchange payment for goods and services. Its industries, including oil and gas, depend on imported goods and components. Soon production will grind to a halt. Employers will have to lay off their workers. Unemployment will rise. No-one expected the West to sanction the Russian Central Bank. Already, the rouble has collapsed and interest rates have doubled. No other major economy has ever been subjected to a package of sanctions this punitive. It amounts to the expulsion of Russia from the global economy. More workers will be laid off. Major industries will find it hard to carry on. Unemployment will rise further. Soaring inflation will erode life savings. We will all be affected. Potentially, this is the rolling back of the globalised economy that emerged after the end of the Cold War. The US and the EU have, in effect, divided the world up. Those states and companies that continue to trade with Russia will find themselves punished - also frozen out of trade with the rich world. It amounts to a new economic iron curtain separating Russia from the West. Much will depend on how China negotiates this new landscape. China and Russia are bonded by their shared antipathy to American power, and their conviction that the greatest threat is from a resurgent, more unified democratic world. China does not want Putin weakened, or the West strengthened. Yet that is exactly what the effect the war in Ukraine has had. Some China watchers believe Beijing will try to challenge the dominance of the dollar as a reserve currency by carving out a distinct yuan zone as an alternative space in the global economy that can be protected from any future attempt by the US to sanction China. Putin's war, therefore, could redraw the international financial map. But above all, this is a war that pits the world's democracies against the world's authoritarian regimes. It is also a war between two conflicting conceptions of the rules by which international relations should function. The Oxford scholar Timothy Garton Ash says these two world views can be expressed in short form by two words - Helsinki versus Yalta. At Yalta in 1945, Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill carved post-war Europe into ""spheres of influence"" - most of Eastern Europe to Russia, the West to the trans-Atlantic alliance that would set about rebuilding Europe's democracies. ""Helsinki"", by contrast, describes a Europe of independent sovereign states, each of which is free to choose its own alliances. This grew out of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 and gradually evolved into the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Ukraine's defenders are fighting for Helsinki. Putin has sent his troops in to impose a modern version of Yalta - which would kill off Ukraine's independence and leave it under Russian domination. Garton Ash argues that the West has been too half-hearted in defending the values of Helsinki - that it has formally acknowledged Ukraine's right to join Nato at some unspecified date in the future without ever intending to make it happen. But Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has signalled a readiness to compromise on Helsinki principles, by agreeing to abandon Ukraine's ambition to become a Nato member. With all the risks that entails, it may yet be the price Ukraine pays for the survival of its statehood. My generation grew up with the existential terror of the threat of nuclear annihilation. The conflict has brought that fear back to public consciousness. Putin has threatened to use Russia's nuclear arsenal. That makes this the most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Then, the Soviet Union shipped nuclear missiles to its ally Cuba. The US assembled a fleet of ships to mount a sea-borne invasion of the island. What the Americans did not know is that the Soviets didn't only have long-range strategic missiles. They also had smaller, tactical nuclear missiles - so-called battlefield nuclear weapons. And that Soviet military doctrine delegated first-use decision making to commanders on the ground. Had the threatened invasion gone ahead, it would have triggered a nuclear exchange. The then American Defence Secretary Robert McNamara only found out about this when the Soviet archives opened in 1991. Only then, did he understand how close the world had come to catastrophe. In a remarkable film called Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert McNamara, he explained how the world had avoided destroying itself. Was it skilled diplomacy? Wise leadership? No. ""Luck,"" he said. ""We lucked out."" That experience, now fading from memory, should focus minds. Correction: This article previously referred to Zbigniew Brzezinski as a former US secretary of state, rather than former national security adviser"
Ukraine: How crowdsourcing is rescuing people from the war zone,2022-03-19T00:34:03.000Z,"Finding a safe route out of Ukraine is not easy. One challenge facing those looking to escape is to find one that is not under heavy bombardment from Russian forces. The UN says more than three million people have have now fled Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion just over three weeks ago.  So how do people actually find safe passage out of the country? One way is via transport arranged by dozens of volunteers based thousands of miles away, who liaise with fellow volunteers in Ukraine. They, in turn, send information in real-time about safe roads to drivers who can rescue busloads of people. But even using this method, travelling is not without considerable danger. In other words, they are crowdsourcing safe passage out of a war zone. Artur Kiulian, a Ukrainian software developer living in the US, was one of many who answered the call for assistance from the country's digital minister, Mykhailo Fedorov. Artur used his skills gained in the tech industry to form UkraineNow, which uses volunteers and messaging apps to evacuate people from Ukraine. ""I've been building tech start-ups for the last decade,"" he said. ""I'm an engineer myself, I have a degree in systems of artificial intelligence.  ""There is limited capacity [from] the UN and the Red Cross. There is no-one else to help. It's all civilians evacuating civilians."" When he spoke to the BBC, Artur was organising the evacuation of children with cancer from Ukraine to Poland. From there, they planned to travel to a hospital in Germany.  He and his team organised the bus, the driver, and the place for them to stay across the border. But crucially, they crowdsourced the safe route too. Firstly, civilians in Ukraine make requests for help online.  The team in the US receives the requests and allocates them to buses which have been purchased or rented with the money UkraineNow raises. Drivers are then put in contact with the civilians, and the evacuation is arranged. The exact process and methods used are more detailed than this, but the information is not being shared here in order to protect the organisation from cyber and real-world attacks. The BBC spoke to one of the people helping on the ground.  Salam, a former refugee himself, organised a bus filled with people out of a city being shelled by the Russian army and across the border into Moldova. ""We have a [group] of women and children that is going to travel to a safe place,"" he said. ""And then they can travel from there to wherever they want."" He says he thinks he has made the journey from Ukraine to Moldova about 16 or 17 times already in the war. ""It's a dangerous journey,"" he said. ""Everybody's nervousâ¦ anything can happen.  ""The road is completely empty right now. We're just driving ourselves and we're far away from the border - so we are in no man's land here.  ""If they stay in their city they will be bombed. They're running for their lives. ""We have an amazing team doing everything they can. There's so many good people on our team that are trying to help so many people."" Salam explained the desperate situation for the people on his bus. ""There's a lot of sadness here,"" he said. ""A lot of women and children have left their husbands and their fathers, and they don't know if they're going to see each other again. ""They just said goodbye, cried, and they left them. You cannot imagine how difficult it is for them."" One of the people who managed to get aboard Salam's bus is Maryia - not her real name - who says she found out about the escape plan through a messaging app. ""I took this phone number from some group [on the app],"" she said. ""I don't remember exactly."" She said it was recommended to her by other people in her city, which has been shelled by Russia. For Maryia, she felt she had no choice but to leave. ""We are going to be without food,"" she said. ""We are going to be bombed in our building. ""I had some work projects, and now they're frozen, and I cannot work. Of course, I cannot get money. So I need to think about my future life. ""I need to survive."" These are the stakes for the evacuees - who in this case were able to escape.

But there is no guarantee that future journeys will be equally successful. This is because the margins for the evacuation are incredibly tight. A previous route used to evacuate civilians was devastated by bombings only 10 hours after the bus left Ukraine. But Salam will continue driving regardless. ""We're not going to stop before this war's going to stop, and people can go back to their homes and be safe,"" he said.  ""Until that, we need to show our solidarity and do everything we can to save people."""
How Kremlin accounts manipulate Twitter,2022-03-19T00:34:41.000Z,"Olena Kurilo became the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Bloodied and bandaged, the 53-year-old teacher said she couldn't believe what had happened to her and her town of Chuhuiv.  Her picture was on the front pages of newspapers across the world. Over the next few days, Russia's government social media accounts began to post a video claiming that Olena hadn't been injured at all.  ""Great photos by the way, they were all over the news,"" the Russian narrator says.  The video then claims Olena was photographed two days later, uninjured. ""A couple of days later, good for her, not a scratch.""  This claim is baseless, the BBC has verified the photo as genuine, as has Reuters. Wild conspiracy theories like these are not uncommon on social media.  But what makes this conspiracy theory so odd is that it was shared by an official Russian government Twitter account - the Russian Mission in Geneva. Two weeks on, the tweet is still live.  The Russian government has a huge network of official Twitter accounts - the BBC found more than 100 of them. They range from accounts that represent foreign missions or embassies, with a few thousand followers, to those with more than a million followers. President Putin has his own account. Many of the accounts are labelled as Russian government organisations by Twitter. Yet, while many of these accounts have spread disinformation, Twitter deals with them differently to Russian state media - like RT or Sputnik. On 28 February, Twitter announced it would prevent tweets from Russian state-affiliated media outlets from being eligible for ""amplification"" - meaning they wouldn't be recommended in the home timeline, notifications, and other places on Twitter. But Twitter has confirmed to the BBC that this policy does not include Russian government accounts.  Tim Graham, a social media analyst at QUT Digital Media Research Centre in Australia, describes this as a ""loophole"" in Twitter's moderation policies, which lets the Russian government pump out misinformation.  ""It's certainly a blind spot in Twitter's defences against disinformation,"" he says.  Intrigued by this spider web of Russian government accounts, Mr Graham - who specialises in analysing co-ordinated activity on social media - decided to investigate further. He analysed 75 Russian government Twitter profiles which, in total, have more than 7 million followers. The accounts have received 30 million likes, been retweeted 36 million times and been replied to 4 million times.  He looked at how many times each Twitter account retweeted one of the other 74 profiles within an hour. He discovered that the Kremlin's network of Twitter accounts work together to retweet and drive up traffic. This practice is sometimes called ""astroturfing"" - when the owner of several accounts uses the profiles they control to retweet content and amplify reach.  ""It's a coordinated retweet network,"" Mr Graham says. ""If these accounts weren't retweeting stuff at the same time, the network would just be a bunch of disconnected dots. So what the network shows, very clearly, is that there's a very dense amount of connections to the way these accounts are retweeting. ""They are using this as an engine to drive their preferred narrative onto Twitter, and they're getting away with it,"" he says. Coordinated activity, using multiple accounts, is against Twitter's rules. ""You can't artificially amplify conversations through the use of multiple accounts,"" Twitter's rules state. But Twitter doesn't treat all accounts equally.  Tweets from government and elected officials can be given more leeway when it comes to moderation. The company says on its website that there may be a public interest in seeing tweets that would otherwise violate its rules.  However, the company doesn't treat official accounts differently when it comes to coordinated behaviour - there is no exemption.  LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyANALYSIS: Putin's redrawn the world - but not as he wantedBATTLEFIELD: What have been Russia's military mistakes?WATCH: Drone footage shows Mariupol devastationIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the war The BBC put Mr Graham's research to Twitter, however the company did not respond directly to his findings.  The BBC also asked the Russian Embassy in the UK about the suggestion that official Russian Twitter accounts behave in a coordinated way - and that many share misinformation. The BBC has not received a response.  On 10 March, the embassy itself tweeted that the bombing of a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol had been faked. The account claimed that women pictured at the scene were actors.  A photo was posted of a woman being carried on a stretcher, with the words ""FAKE"" plastered over the image. The claim was false. A few days later it was reported that both she and her baby had died.  Twitter deleted several tweets making the ""FAKE"" claim, after the BBC flagged them. Yet there are many other examples of Russian disinformation still up on the Russian government's Twitter accounts. The unfounded claim that Olena Kurilo wasn't really injured is still live - it has been retweeted by more than 20 separate Russian government accounts.  Unfounded claims that Ukraine has bioweapons have been shared by the Russian network and are still up - as are claims of an imminent chemical attack being allegedly prepared by Ukrainians. The problem Twitter has is that proving content is false can be messy and complex in a time of war.  Savvas Zannettou, who analyses social media moderation at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, says war makes policing social media even harder.  ""To effectively moderate is impossibleâ¦ the information comes at a very rapid pace, and it's coming from all over the place,"" he says.  It appears two things are happening here. Muddled and incomplete information on the ground means only examples of misinformation which are easy to prove are taken down on platforms such as Twitter.  Added to that, Twitter's own public interest exceptions means tweets from government officials can be treated differently from other accounts. The BBC asked Twitter whether tweets from Russian ministries and embassies were included in its public interest exceptions, however the social media company did not respond to this specific question. Twitter said: ""We've taken numerous enforcement actions on Russian embassy accounts, including requiring the removal of Tweets.""  Twitter also said it would also be doing more in the coming days to flag accounts linked to the Kremlin. ""We'll be expanding our government account labels to additional Russian embassies to add context for people interacting with these accounts on Twitter.""  The Kremlin's social media accounts also exist on Facebook and other platforms - this isn't a headache consigned just to Twitter.  In January 2021, after the Capitol Hill riots, Twitter banned Donald Trump for his role in repeating allegations of voter fraud. Twitter argued that repeated disinformation, posted from a position of power, had caused real world violence.  As official Russian accounts continue to post wild misinformation during a time of war, it is perfectly possible that the Kremlin will end up facing another sanction - being frozen out of Twitter.

"Newspaper headlines: 'Putin parties, Ukraine burns' and Biden warns Xi",2022-03-19T05:35:54.000Z,"Several of Saturday's papers lead with Vladimir Putin's continued aggression in Ukraine, contrasted by the charm offensive he has launched in Russia.  ""Putin parties, Ukraine burns"" is the i weekend's headline as the paper reports on the Russian president's ""huge war rally"" that was held in Moscow. The paper notes that some have said that the crowds were government employees brought in from across the country.  In the besieged south-eastern city of Mariupol in Ukraine, street fighting is preventing the rescue of hundreds of people - including children - who are buried under the rubble of a theatre that was hit on Wednesday, an official tells the paper.  UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has told the Times that the Kremlin is using peace talks with Ukraine as a ""smokescreen"" while it prepares to carry out more ""appalling atrocities"" and war crimes.  ""If a country is serious about negotiations, it doesn't indiscriminately bomb civilians that day,"" Ms Truss told the paper.  She predicted that Mr Putin will resort to ""worse and worse"" methods as his progress in Ukraine falters. US President Joe Biden has warned that Beijing will face ""consequences"" if it provides Russia with weapons to help in its invasion of Ukraine, the Daily Telegraph reports.  But Chinese President Xi Jinping said the US was responsible for the war.  US officials have alleged that Russia is seeking military support from Beijing, including armed drones, surface-to-air missiles, armoured vehicles and intelligence gathering technology. The plight of Ukrainian refugees has inspired the Royal Family to offer ""practical support"", according to the Daily Express. It adds that aides are looking into what steps senior royals can take to help those who have fled Ukraine. Also in royal news but away from the war in Ukraine, the Daily Mail says that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have had to cancel their first big engagement on their Caribbean tour after villagers described the visit as ""colonialism"".  The paper reports that the couple were due to start their visit to Belize with a trip to a sustainable cocoa farm on Sunday, but local people have staged a protest, calling the visit a ""slap in the face"".  And the Sun reports that the Queen intends to spend ""much more"" time at Craigowan Lodge, on the Balmoral estate.  The Highlands cottage is one of the 95-year-old monarch's favourite homes, the paper adds. Meanwhile, P&O Ferries is facing a fierce backlash after it sacked hundreds of staff, the FT Weekend reports.  Government ministers have said the company might have broken the law and the Archbishop of Canterbury has labelled the move ""unethical"" and ""inhumane"".  The paper says that the company's reputation has been ""shattered"" after it dismissed its UK crews with immediate effect on Thursday.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said P&O had ""given business a bad name"". P&O said the decision to sack workers was a last resort. The Daily Mirror says P&O Ferries has been accused of operating ""modern slave ships"", replacing 800 crew with Â£2.60-an-hour agency staff.  The company denied the claim, which was made by an RMT union official, the paper reports. Labour MP Karl Turner said: ""They've treated the workers abysmally."" P&O Ferries has been warned by the business secretary that it could face an unlimited fine if it is found to have breached the law, the Guardian reports.  Mr Kwarteng wrote to the company to express the government's ""anger and disappointment"".  Mr Kwarteng highlighted the taxpayer support received by the firm, suggesting the procedure for large-scale redundancies appear not to have been followed, the paper adds.  P&O said it did not consult staff or unions before the sackings because the process would be highly disruptive. And finally, the Daily Star emphasises that it will be ""Hot! Hot! Hot!"" as temperatures are expected to exceed Ibiza in the next few days.  ""Brits set for 20C sizzler as spring arrives early,"" the paper adds.

"P&O Ferries' job cuts a 'PR disaster', say experts",2022-03-18T22:40:31.000Z,"P&O Ferries may save money by laying off 800 workers and replacing them with cheaper agency staff but it's come at a huge cost to its brand, experts warn.  ""It's the worst example of how to treat employees I've seen in more than 30 years of doing crisis communications,"" says Stuart Bruce, who advises companies on their PR strategy.  In just a few hours the company became a case study in how not to handle a difficult situation, experts say. P&O said cuts were needed to survive. ""The plan seemed to be: Sack 800 staff with immediate effect by three-minute video message; manhandle those who refuse leave their posts (using handcuffs if necessary); leave customers stranded in various ports because there's no one to crew ships; and replace all staff with cheap labour in a few weeks. What could possibly go wrong?"" says Kate Hartley, author of ""How to Communicate in a Crisis"".  P&O Ferries on Friday said none of its people were directed to use handcuffs nor force and  it ""offered enhanced severance terms to those affected to properly and promptly compensate them for the lack of warning and consultation"". Dover MP heckled by angry P&O Ferries protestersP&O Ferries sparks outrage by sacking 800 workersProtesters turn out in force against P&O sackings However, Ms Hartley, who co-founded social media crisis management firm Polpeo, said there's an old adage in the world of PR - that you can't communicate your way out a crisis that you behaved your way into - and that P&O has behaved its way into one of the worst corporation crises she has seen in recent years.  P&O Ferries is owned by Dubai logistics giant DP World which is, in turn, controlled by the Dubai sovereign wealth fund. Stuart Bruce says it's hard to believe any PR adviser, however junior, would recommend such a ""bungled"" course of action.  ""I think it's being driven by DP World where there will be a less collegiate style of management.  ""PR professionals can't force employers or clients to heed their expert counsel and act on it... this is not a PR failure, it's a failure of humanity. The leadership of P&O Ferries and DP World shouldn't need lessons in how to be decent or moral,"" Mr Bruce added.  For PR consultant Abby Mangold, the biggest mistake was the pre-recorded message delivered to workers. ""It's not the way you tell hundreds of people they're fired. Yes, there were staff in multiple locations but at the very least, have the courage to do it live, and demonstrate recognition of how devastating this news is going to be for them.  ""Then. you take the time to talk to your people, without ambiguity or spin, about why you've had to make this difficult decision.""  Last year the boss of US mortgage company, Better.com, who fired hundreds of his staff in a Zoom meeting was forced to apologise for the way he handled the lay-offs. P&O Ferries' behaviour has united unions and politicians in outrage.  In a letter to the company, the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said it had given the company a bad name.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter There have been more than 3,000 mentions of #boycottpando on social media with a reach of about 3.5 million in the last 24 hours, notes Abby Mangold.  ""Every crisis is digital. P&O have failed to have any social [media] strategy at all. This will have huge economic as well as reputational impact,"" she said. But as the howls of protest grow louder, will customers give this ferry operator a wide berth? Or will this episode be forgotten about in a year or two's time? European trucking firm Girteka Logistics operates more than 9000 trucks, mostly on international routes across Europe - with hundreds transported on ferries every day.  Simonas Bartkus, head of marketing and communications at Girteka Logistics, says his business would not stop using P&O because it has to rely on the capacity the ferry operator provides on key routes into the UK. But there could be potential long-term implications from the fall-out of the P&O Ferries sackings if owner DP World has any future aspirations to expand its business in the UK."
P&O Ferries security âtreated staff like criminalsâ,2022-03-18T16:03:31.000Z,"After 24 hours in a state of disbelief, more sacked P&O workers are starting to talk about what happened on Thursday.  Speaking out could cost them the severance pay they've been promised, but they are angry and upset about how they have been treated.  Noah, not his real name, told us he and his colleagues were treated like criminals.  ""There were guards at duty free as if we were going to burgle it,"" he told the BBC. ""They thought we were going to go in and help ourselves, which we wouldn't have done,"" he said.  ""It could have been handled better. It was intimidating, it made people angry,"" he added. Staff who lost their jobs on Thursday have been told not to speak to the media. They have been offered enhanced redundancy packages with certain terms attached. It is understood speaking to the media breaks these terms, causing them to forfeit those payments.  On Thursday, P&O Ferries said it was a ""tough"" decision making 800 staff redundant, but that the company would ""not be a viable business"" without the changes. On Friday it added: ""The teams escorting the seafarers off our vessels were totally professional in handling this difficult task with all appropriate sensitivity."" But many people who have spoken to the BBC in Dover anonymously in the last 24 hours are both upset and outraged by the way crew were treated.  Noah described his experience. ""We looked out of the window at all these people in green coats on the quayside. We had to wait on the ship. Bearing in mind - we're all sensible adults on the ship.  ""There was no point staging a sit-in - it wouldn't solve anything. So, once we were told what had happened, we packed our belongings and waited for instructions to get off. ""There was security staff on the vessel who were obnoxious and rude and treated us really like criminals to be honest, the sort you'd see in a borstal, probably. It wasn't pleasant."" Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? What are my rights if I am made redundant? ""I am devastated it was our last day at work. During Covid there'd been several redundancies in the company so I wasn't expecting this one to come along,"" Noah said. In Dover the crew have local friends and relatives, some of whom have joined them in their protests. They came to collect the sacked crew from the harbour yesterday, picking them up as they came off the ships carrying bin liners filled with their personal belongings. Some said they had had to leave family photos on board in their cabins as they didn't have enough bags.  The trades unions at the protest want action and are calling on the Labour Party to do more. The RMT union says they spoke to the Labour leader Keir Starmer on Friday morning. The government has said it is looking ""very closely"" at the action P&O Ferries has taken to see if they broke any laws by informing the crew they were losing their jobs with no prior consultation or warning. The prime minister's spokesman said once they had concluded their examination they would decide what the ""ramifications"" were. There were ""valid questions"" about contracts that the government has with the company, the spokesman added. Noah said for him the change still hasn't properly sunk in yet.  ""It's going take time to get used to not working, I've worked all my life,"" he said. He enjoyed working on the ferries and is optimistic he will find work in the industry in the future. ""It has put me off working for P&O, But I've still got my bills to pay at the end of day,"" he added."
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release: 'Richard showed us what love really means',2022-03-19T00:15:01.000Z,"This week Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was finally reunited with her husband and daughter in the UK after years of detention in Iran. Now comes the task of rebuilding their lives - but the BBC's Caroline Hawley, who has been in touch with the family throughout their ordeal, says the bond between them has already helped them endure the darkest of times. It's exactly six years since Richard Ratcliffe stood at Gatwick Airport, waving goodbye to his wife.   Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was flying to Iran - taking their daughter Gabriella to see her grandparents. Richard had no reason to believe they wouldn't be back home a couple of weeks later.    ""It was a slightly rushed goodbye,"" he once told me. ""Gabriella at the time was one and three quarters and a bit of a handful. I was just really wishing her good luck with the flight."" Earlier this week, Nazanin stepped off a plane at RAF Brize Norton. After years of detention, she and fellow British-Iranian Anoosheh Ashoori were finally coming home. A little voice asked: ""Is that Mummy?"" Then Gabriella, now aged seven, rushed to hug her mother.    And yet at that moment, Richard, who must have wished with all his heart to run forward and hold Nazanin too, hung back.     The kind, gentle accountant - who waged such a steely campaign to get his wife home - allowed Gabriella to run first into her mother's arms, as Nazanin sobbed loudly with relief.   Their story is one of any ordinary family caught in the middle of murky international politics; a long-overdue British debt to Iran; and diplomatic manoeuvrings about as far from their usual lives as it's possible to imagine. It's a story of separation.  But, at its heart, it's a story about the power of love - the love of a mother for her child, a husband for his wife. And one man's extraordinary single-minded dedication to getting his wife back.  ""He showed us what love really means,"" says Tulip Siddiq, the couple's MP who has become a friend to them, too.    On Thursday, their first morning together after the reunion started with Richard making Nazanin a cup of tea. Then came a walk in the park with Gabriella as they began the process of rediscovering each other.  ""I don't think he'd mind me saying that there's a kind of shyness, of getting to know each other again - a bit like when you first start dating,"" Ms Siddiq tells me.   ""He kept saying 'baby steps' when I spoke to him about his relationship with Nazanin. But he just sounds 10 years younger now.""  When Richard and Nazanin first met, he immediately felt so comfortable with her, he later described it as ""like coming home"". It was 2007 and they were introduced by a mutual friend at an academic conference.  ""She transformed his life when she came along,"" says Richard's younger sister, Rebecca. ""He just dotes on her. She's everything to him. And you can see why - she's so beautiful and lovely.""  Nazanin and Richard married two years after they met - first in a register office and then at a more traditional Iranian celebration. Then in 2014, Gabriella was born. ""When they were both taken from him, it was the darkest time of his life. So there was no choice [for him] but to keep fighting for them,"" Rebecca Ratcliffe says.  Richard's extraordinary campaign buoyed Nazanin in the darkest days of her incarceration, when she was feeling suicidal, according to Ms Siddiq - even when prison guards taunted Nazanin that her husband's act of love would only earn her more years in jail.     ""Nazanin always said to me that she held her head up high because she was proud that her husband was there and campaigning for her and it gave her the strength to keep going,"" Ms Siddiq says.  At the start of her imprisonment, Nazanin told doctors, when she was in solitary confinement with the lights always on, her interrogators taunted her that Richard was having affairs and that they had photographic evidence.    One of her female guards used to talk loudly to her own child just outside Nazanin's cell. ""It was unbearable,"" Nazanin said. ""I dreaded her shifts as I knew she would do that to torture me."" The hardest part for Nazanin was being separated from Gabriella, who she had only just stopped breastfeeding when she was arrested. There was the mother's guilt of not being able to care for her child.   In 2017, she wrote to Gabriella - nicknamed Gisou - from Evin Prison in Tehran: ""Forgive me for all the nights I was not by your side to hold your warm little hand till you fall asleep. ""You, I and your father will never succumb to this hurricane of fate. The love we share knows no boundaries or walls. It is our life. There will come a day that we will be able to live anew all the days of our life.  ""My Gisou, there will come a day that we will be together again and tenderly hold one another's loving hands."" On Thursday, that day finally came. Gabriella slept in a bed between her parents for the first time since she was a baby. Nazanin has told Tulip Siddiq that her daughter has been attached to her ever since ""like an extra limb"". Nazanin on BBC SoundsWhy has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe been freed now?Iranian-Briton's family delighted at his releaseWho is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe? For husband and wife, they must learn to live with each other again. Their flat is a ""pigsty"", laughs Rebecca Ratcliffe, cluttered with campaign materials.     ""They're different people than they were six years ago,"" she says.  ""They have had very traumatic but separate experiences and they need to come together and rebuild their relationship. And there's also the challenge of co-parenting again."" Over the past few years, they've wondered if they still have time to have another child - Nazanin will be 44 on Boxing Day.  Richard, talking tenderly about Nazanin to me last year, admitted: ""I don't think I can possibly understand what she's gone through."" He knows there will be ""bumpy"" times ahead.  But for the moment being together is all that matters.  A short tweet from Richard, with a picture of the three of them embracing, summed the reunion up: ""No place like home. Thank-you to everyone who made this possibleâ¦ You have made us whole."" ""Whatever devils there are, they both know they love each other,"" Rebecca Ratcliffe says. ""If any couple is going to survive this experience, it's them."""
French elections: Putin's war gives Macron boost in presidential race,2022-03-19T00:14:41.000Z,"Russia's war in Ukraine has shaken up next month's French presidential elections, and it is as plain as day that the main beneficiary is the man already sitting in the ElysÃ©e. Thanks to a mediocre opposition, goodish economic news and the decline of Covid, Emmanuel Macron was already the strong favourite, even before Russia invaded. But what's happened in the last month makes his re-election seem almost inevitable.   Not only has his poll rating strongly improved in the multi-candidate first round on 10 April, where nearly a third of voters now say they'll plump for the incumbent. But also in any combination for the 24 April run-off, it's Mr Macron who wins hands down - whether it is against Marine Le Pen or Eric Zemmour of the far right, ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse of the conservative Republicans or Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon of the far left. ""Unless there is some freakish accident, there is almost no chance that Emmanuel Macron will not get re-elected next month,"" says veteran commentator Pierre Haski. ""He has two elements working in his favour. One is the disarray of the opposition. The other is the international situation, which is playing almost incredibly into his hands. It's turning into the most unexciting presidential election in living memory.""  As the fighting escalated in Ukraine, French news and social media switched from campaign mode to war coverage. Issues of vital importance a month ago, which helped define the competing candidates, suddenly seemed less important. Existential anxiety replaced worry over the price of electric cars.  At the same time, Emmanuel Macron was seen striding the international stage.  His conversations with Vladimir Putin may have brought zilch in the way of results, but he was doing what the French like their leaders to do: going the ""extra mile for peace"". And with his customary good fortune, the president also happened to be this semester's head of the European Council, representing the EU's 27 governments, with the result that he took the lead in organising sanctions on Moscow and arms to Kyiv.   Snaps taken by his official photographer have been much mocked for appearing to portray Mr Macron as a wannabe Volodymyr Zelensky - or maybe a Cuba-crisis Kennedy.    But any PR damage will have been more than made up for by the overriding impression that he is indeed the man at the helm. ""There is genuine fear out there. There is an external threat. And when that happens, it makes people turn to the leader. Deep down, they feel that now is not the time for division. It's the rally-round-the-flag effect,"" says pollster Emmanuel RiviÃ¨re of Kantar Public. ""It's also very important for the French that their country still has an important role at a world level. So when they see Macron talking to Putin, even at a very long table, it reassures them.  The French are very sensitive to the question of whether they still count in the world - and Macron makes them feel they do."" TWELVE CANDIDATES: Who's in the race to challenge Macron? With re-election apparently so sure, French commentators are nonetheless pointing up a couple of warning lights for the president.  The first is the classic problem of the strong favourite - that voters feel that he is a shoo-in and fail to turn out on the day.   The worry is not so much that he would lose, but that victory would be by a smaller margin than expected, giving heart to the opposition and lessening the chances of a dynamic second term. The second, related problem has to do with the campaign. In this time of crisis, practically the only argument that other candidates can wield against Emmanuel Macron is that he is too preoccupied with higher matters to descend into the arena and get dirty. You hear this a lot from the Republicans' ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse, who warns of a reconduction tacite, or autorenewal. It is the legal term used for insurance or mobile phone contracts that roll over automatically unless there is explicit refusal, often to the irritation of the purchaser.   In the political sphere, it would mean Mr Macron being re-elected by default, not with widespread support for his programme but simply because of the special circumstance of the war. ""[Macron] is shirking a proper debate on his record in office and on the reforms which this country so badly needs,"" Ms PÃ©cresse told me at a rally this week in the town of Meaux, east of Paris: ""It is very disrespectful for the French."" The more or less explicit threat is that if there isn't a real debate about domestic issues in the campaign, then Emmanuel Macron will only have himself to blame if there is trouble later when he tries to introduce change - for example, raising the official retirement age to 65. ""You know what the French are like: if they are not able to make their voices heard in the election, then they will do it in the street,"" says Ms PÃ©cresse's ally, the mayor of Meaux, former minister Jean-FranÃ§ois CopÃ©.  ""And who knows where that would end?"" Polling data provided by NSPPolls.."
Tanzania viewpoint: What President Samia has achieved in her first year,2022-03-19T00:15:33.000Z,"In our series of letters from African journalists, Sammy Awami looks back at how Tanzania has changed in the year since Samia Suluhu Hassan became the country's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli. If a happiness index was taken within the last few weeks, it would have shown Tanzanians to be the happiest people in the world, according to some Tanzanians on social media. Within the past few weeks, President Samia Suluhu Hassan, widely known as just Mama Samia, met the two leading figures of the opposition party Chadema, Tundu Lissu and Freeman Mbowe - meetings that would have been unimaginable just over a year ago. Mr Lissu is living in exile after he was shot 16 times in 2017 in an assassination attempt widely believed to have been politically motivated. Mr Mbowe has just been released from jail, where he was held on terrorism charges since his arrest last July ahead of a public rally to demand constitutional reform. ""You should see the smile on my face. Definitely warms the heart. A true leader. Unmatched in her league #ServantLeadership,"" tweeted Sara Ezra Teri, hours after news broke of the meeting between President Samia and Mr Lissu in Belgium. Lawyer and prominent activist Fatma Karume tweeted: ""I am PROUD of you, SSH [Samia Suluhu Hassan]. Lissu proud of you too.""  A year ago, Tanzania was a very different place. Then-President John Magufuli believed the opposition were puppets of foreign interests. His only language towards the opposition was force, and he made it his mission to eliminate multiparty politics.  That things have changed is agreed across the political divide.  ""I'm not a cheerleader, [but] there are things which Mama [Samia] has started to do well. And because she has been doing well, we will support her to do them better,"" Mr Lissu said. What is contested, however, is whether President Samia can take full credit for these changes. Tanzania plunged into authoritarianism under the same ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), that she now chairs. She was the vice-president in a government that worked hard to eliminate the opposition and sent people to jail for simply criticising it. Many kidnappings and forced disappearances, widely allegedly to be politically motivated, happened under the government where she was second-in-command. There is also the question of how far is she willing to go to institutionalise the reforms which are currently taking place. Many of them appear to be based merely on the president's goodwill.  For instance, while meeting opposition politicians is a significant step towards building trust, the controversial Political Parties Act remains unchanged. This gives the registrar of political parties wide and vague powers to de-register parties and hand up to a year in jail to anyone engaging in unauthorised civic education, such as encouraging voter registration. Likewise, while bans on several media outlets have been lifted, the 2016 Media Services Act, the 2018 Online Content Regulations and the 2015 Cybercrimes Act that enhanced censorship and threatened individuals and media companies with sanctions such as suspension and closure of outlets are still in force. What President Samia has achieved so far is to put the brakes on a fast descent into total authoritarianism. She has returned the country to the pre-2015 era, but has done little to alter the institutional structures which enabled her predecessor to crack down on dissent so completely.  These moves towards a more tolerant type of politics suggest that the president wants to make changes. But her actions hint that she is torn between pursuing reforms and keeping the party she leads in power. For example, the opposition politicians she has met still face restrictions if they want to hold rallies.  However, there is a sense that these changes will last. This optimism is drawn from the belief that President Samia has now fully consolidated her grip on the ruling party. In the first few months after Mr Magufuli's death, she had to remind her audience that as a female president she was still worthy of respect and trust. Back then, ministers tended to only partly carry out her directives.  Her growing authority is probably best illustrated by the release of Mr Mbowe - whose prosecution was pursued for eight months despite a lack of evidence and widespread calls to drop the case. It is believed it was dropped in the end because she stood up to some remaining Magufuli loyalists who resisted some of her reforms.    Some liken the ongoing changes to the era of former President Jakaya Kikwete, who was one of Mrs Samia's mentors and Mr Magufuli's predecessor. His leadership style was conciliatory, and political differences with the opposition were often resolved through dialogue over a cup of tea and nibbles at state house. As a result, the government tended not to enforce repressive laws.  This impression is backed by the return of the so-called liberal economic policies. Foreign investors are being actively wooed, Western donors are now regarded as development partners as opposed to imperialists or ""mabeberu"", loosely translated as male goats - a disparaging term used by Mr Magufuli. With her roots in collaborative activism and growing up in Zanzibar, where there is a culture of humility and hospitality, it is not surprising she has a different leadership style. But she could face significant resistance from the CCM if she, for example, agreed to a referendum on constitutional reforms, a long-standing demand of the opposition and pro-democracy activists, as it could disadvantage her party by loosening its absolute grip on power.  President Samia took office in extraordinary circumstances, in a country and political system dominated by patriarchal attitudes which were promoted by her predecessor.  In one public address, former President Magufuli jokingly fantasised about beating up resistant women, while in an other he made sexual remarks about a Member of Parliament over her light skin. He received applause on both occasions.   One year later, President Samia has succeeded in reviving hopes of a fresh start.  However, the true measure of her intent to make lasting changes lies in the speed and extent of legal and institutional reforms which would not only cement her legacy but also protect Tanzanians' freedoms, and shield the country from potential authoritarian leaders who reach State House in future.

Sri Lanka tests UN's patience on human rights,2022-03-19T00:20:04.000Z,"Memories of the dark cell and constant fear for his life still haunt Murugiah Komahan, who spent six years in prison on anti-terrorism charges in Sri Lanka. Mr Komahan, 40, is among thousands of Tamils and others detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) in recent decades. Successive governments dominated by the Sinhalese majority used the PTA primarily to arrest those suspected of links with the separatist Tamil Tigers until the rebels' defeat in 2009.  But more than a decade after the civil war ended, the act is still in use and Sri Lanka is under pressure to reform it.  The island's access to lucrative export markets in Europe depends on it making progress on human rights. Mr Komahan, who's from northern Jaffna region, was first arrested under the anti-terrorism act in 2010 on charges of links with the rebels. ""Police tried to force me to sign a confession but when I refused, I was severely beaten. An officer even threatened to shoot me. When I complained to a judge about being tortured, I was beaten even more,"" Mr Komahan told the BBC. Finally, he said, he signed a confession in Sinhala, a language he doesn't understand. He was worried that if he refused, he might be sent to solitary confinement. A court freed him in 2016 for lack of evidence - but Mr Komahan says he is still being monitored by intelligence agencies.  ""The constant surveillance is making it difficult to return to a normal life,"" he says.  Rights groups say the PTA has been used to make arbitrary arrests, to detain people for years without due legal process and to extract false confessions under torture, accusations the authorities deny.  It was first introduced as a temporary measure more than 40 years ago, when the insurgency for a Tamil homeland was in its early stages. But it's also been used to target other minority groups, government critics and civil society activists over the years, campaigners say. ""We have cases of people who spent several years in prison before they were discharged - that means there was no evidence and no indictment was filed,"" said Ambika Satkunanathan, a prominent human rights activist. She alleges the PTA was used to target Muslims after the island's 2019 Easter Sunday bomb attacks by Islamist militants.  These include prominent Muslim lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah, a vocal opponent of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He was released on bail in January amid growing international criticism  after spending almost two years in detention.  According to the Sri Lankan prison authorities, there are still nearly 300 people detained under the PTA, some of whom have been held for more than a decade. Following years of criticism, the government has now tabled amendments to the act with ""the objective of bringing it in line with international norms and best practice"".  Justice Minister Mohamed Ali Sabry told the BBC: ""One of the key provisions in the amendments is if the indictment is not filed for more than a year, then the detainee can apply for bail."" He said officials were trying to expedite pending anti-terrorism cases and 86 people had recently been released.  But campaigners say the proposed changes do not go far enough. For example, ""a confession given to an assistant superintendent of police or above can still be used as evidence in trial"", Ms Satkunanathan said. Discrimination and harassment haunt Sri Lanka's MuslimsUN to collect evidence of alleged Sri Lanka war crimesHow fear set in overnight in Sri Lanka'Why can't you find our sons?' The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), which is holding its spring session in Geneva, and others are watching closely. Another critical assessment by the council later this year would not augur well for Sri Lanka. The European Union has already warned it will suspend tariff free access for Sri Lankan companies if there is no progress on human rights. The island's exporters sent garments worth more than $2bn to the bloc in 2020.  Given Sri Lanka's foreign exchange reserves crisis, a bailout from the International Monetary Fund looks on the cards. Last month, UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet acknowledged the Sri Lankan government had taken some steps in addressing human rights issues. But she also called on member states ""to investigate and prosecute international crimes committed by all parties in Sri Lanka"". Last year, member states authorised her to collect and preserve evidence of alleged war crimes by both sides in the 26-year conflict. The UN estimates 80-100,000 people were killed and thousands disappeared.  ""The initial step is to create a centralised repository for the wide array of material that is available, including that collected by the UN over the years, which is substantial,"" Rory Mungoven, Asia-Pacific chief at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, told the BBC. ""We are analysing all the material and pinpointing particular cases, particular perpetrators where further action may be possible.""  After the inaction of successive Sri Lankan governments, the intention is that material gathered could be used to try war crimes suspects outside the island under the principle of ""universal jurisdiction"". President Rajapaksa, a hardliner who led the war efforts, has consistently rejected allegations of war crimes by the military and it's highly unlikely that he might agree to the conditions set by the UN. Many of his supporters in the Sinhalese majority see those accused of wrongdoing as heroes. His foreign minister criticised the UN decision earlier this month. ""It creates obstacles to reconciliation efforts, breeds hatred by reopening past wounds, and polarises society,"" GL Peiris told the session in Geneva.  Ministers in Colombo point to measures already taken, such as rehabilitating former rebels and the setting up of an office to determine the status of those still missing in the war. Critics argue little came of such initiatives. People like Murugiah Komahan agree. He and others who were jailed unjustly say their lives were ruined - and they'll never get back the years they lost.

Disability: Bedbound Gwynedd woman can only stare at ceiling,2022-03-19T07:04:15.000Z,"""I'm working very hard every second to stay alive, but it's increasingly difficult."" Jenny Rowbory is 35 and has been bedbound for well over a decade now. A genetic condition means ligaments in her neck cannot support her head and she now spends every day staring up at the same patch of ceiling. Her only hope is life-changing surgery in the USA but her family estimate it will cost Â£750,000 - money they simply do not have. Her mother Ann shakes her head: ""No-one should have to live like this, and to know that money is the only reason."" Joint popping: Ehlers-Danlos SyndromeThe chef who can never eat again Ann and her husband Ian care for their daughter around the clock at their home in a rural village in Gwynedd, north Wales. One of them is on hand at all times and they never leave their house together in case Jenny needs help. ""One of us always has to be here. If she drops something, who's going to pick it up? She can't,"" said Ann. ""If anything happens in her room she can't sort it out by herself."" Jenny had been an active, sporty schoolgirl and teenager and was throwing herself into life at university when she first became ill in 2004. Today, she cannot do anything for herself, relies on bedpans and is unable to bathe, shower or dress herself. She was initially diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis - or ME - sometimes known as chronic fatigue syndrome. It left her experiencing chest pains, exhaustion and muscle spasms and she was bedridden for much of the time, but there was worse to come. In 2015, Jenny was told tests revealed she had vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The genetic disorder means her body produces faulty collagen, a protein that is a vital building block of supporting connective tissue, such as ligaments and tendons. It can lead to overly flexible joints, skin conditions and, in rare cases such as Jenny's, fragile blood vessels. Instability in Jenny's neck became life-threatening in 2020 and she had an operation to fuse bones in place, but it was not a success. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is the name for 13 rare inherited conditions that affect connective tissueConnective tissues act like a glue to support the skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bonesJenny has a severe form of EDS which means she has spinal instability, especially in her neckThe vascular form of EDS also means she is at risk from weakened blood vesselsYou can find more information about the syndromes at Ehlers-Danlos Support UK  Jenny has been left unable to move her head for fear of risking more damage or reducing blood flow. ""Various sections of my neck feel like they're being pulled apart in different directions,"" she wrote in a recent post on her website, which records what her life is like. ""I have to spend 18 hours a day straining to hold my neck and head in a certain position."" Since the failed surgery, Jenny and her family said they had run out of treatment options in the UK. Instead, they have pinned their hopes on a specialist neurosurgeon in the US, believed to be only one of a handful in the world who understand Jenny's condition. The family said the expert was the only one in the world specialising in reversing neck fusion operations and has told them Jenny would require at least three surgical procedures to offer any hope of improvement. But it comes at a price. Jenny would need a full medical air-evacuation team to get her to the United States, then there would be the cost of surgery and recuperation. The beauty queen making her invisible condition very publicThe photographs revealing people behind rare illnesses ""To know there is this neurosurgeon out there who has the experience to help her and not to have the money to be able to get her there - it's just so frustrating,"" added Ann. Despite a daunting price tag, Jenny and her family have been determined to raise the cash they need. Jenny has always had a passion for poetry and launched a book of her collected poems last September, called We Are The Winter People, with proceeds going towards her treatment costs. In 2020, during the Covid lockdown, a special evening was streamed online, featuring support from the likes of Oscar winning actress Olivia Colman and comic Lee Mack. In her latest bid to reach the surgery target, Jenny is asking people to help her transport a giant cuddly giraffe around the world, taking pictures of themselves with Jenny the giraffe, while tracking it online. ""It would create a story which people then could follow hopefully, and that would then encourage people to think of donating,"" said Jenny's father. ""How she has dealt with it, I haven't the faintest idea. As parents, we have just looked on and offered any support we could.  ""But for her, she is living through it - she is living through the nightmare."""
"'I sent my brother flak jackets, helmets and boots'",2022-03-18T22:14:04.000Z,"When Olia Hercules first saw what was happening in Ukraine she went through a rollercoaster of emotions. The chef and author, has lived in the UK for the last 20 years but was born and raised in Ukraine and still has family there. ""I've had really dark days, when I didn't want to live. I had days when I felt the most powerful I've ever felt in my life. And I had days when I felt completely numb,"" she says. But within a fortnight she had turned her emotions to a practical purpose. Olia's east London kitchen where she usually tests recipes is now no longer dedicated to food preparation. Instead it is the headquarters of a fundraising campaign to send protective equipment to Ukraine's soldiers, including her brother, Sasha, who has joined the fight to defend the country. When the fighting first spread to southern Ukraine, where Olia's family is from, Sasha told her he was going to try to head for Lviv in the western part of the country. But, his plans quickly changed.  ""He messaged me, and he said that he's not going to leave, that the situation is extremely desperate, and that he needs to go and join the territorial defences,"" Olia says.  ""But he realised that when you join, you're only given a rifle and that's it. There was no protective gear, there were no helmets, no protective vests, not even kneepads. No radios, nothing."" What struck Olia in particular, was how it was ordinary people joining the fight, people like her, who a week earlier were ""tapping on their laptops and drinking flat whites"" but were now taking up weapons. The conversation with her brother spurred Olia into action. She posted a video to her 70,000 followers on Instagram, asking for donations to help buy protective equipment like flak jackets, boots, and helmets for her brother and his team in Kyiv.  In just two days, she collected over Â£100,000. Then she set about sourcing the equipment from military surplus stores.  There was an early hiccup when the flood of donations to her Paypal account was flagged up as unusual by the algorithm monitoring transactions. ""It took a while, but we finally managed to release the funds,"" she says. Then came the logistics - finding a way to send a van over to deliver the items to Ukraine. Nevertheless, within two weeks of the start of her campaign, the items had reached their destination.  ""It's just such an amazing thing,"" she says. ""I was so worried that maybe, because Kyiv is like basically surrounded, I just thought, 'how are they going to break through?' but they did,"" she says. Sasha sent her a video of him and his fellow fighters wearing the new things.  Hundreds of people across the UK, many with connections to Ukraine, have been collecting items and raising funds since the Russian invasion at the end of February. The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) and other charities suggest donating money as the most effective way to ensure people in Ukraine and refugees in neighbouring countries get what they need. DEC brings under one umbrella 15 of the country's biggest charitable organisations - including the British Red Cross and Save the Children.   The group estimates 18 million people will be affected by the war in Ukraine, and four million will be displaced. It's now actively campaigning for donations to provide food, water, shelter, healthcare and protection for those fleeing conflict. But charities and official fundraising groups are very closely regulated in terms of what they are and aren't allowed to fundraise for and finance, points out James Maloney, a partner at London-based law firm Farrer & Co. ""There's a bit of a web of laws and regulation that you need to work your way through. Charities have purposes and those purposes set out what they can do, where they work, and who they can help,"" he says.  Mike Noyes, director of humanitarian aid at Action Aid UK, which is also part of the DEC group, has been on Poland's border with Ukraine, helping support women and children fleeing conflict. Action Aid has helped provide food, access to phones and medical facilities. ""The main way we plan is to listen to people and find out what they want, to make sure we're responding to their needs rather than telling them what's good for them. It's really, really important that we put the refugees from Ukraine, the people displaced within Ukraine, at the centre of our response,"" he says.  When Olia set out to find protective equipment for her brother, she hoped she would be able to work with a charity or group already set up with supply lines and logistics to help procure the equipment and get it to Ukraine. But nothing like that was operating, she says. While her priority now is to continue sourcing and sending supplies to her family and friends back home, she also wants to help her country rebuild, not just physically but psychologically from the horrors of war.  ""My aim is to help communities, especially where I already have family and friends,"" she says.  Her long-term plan is to raise money to build cookery schools, where school-leavers can learn a skill.  In the meantime she has launched a campaign called CookForUkraine. It encourages people all over the world to try their hand at cooking or baking Ukrainian dishes, but more importantly, she says, to gather around the table to discuss the war and work out how they best can help.

How Poland's business community is helping Ukrainians,2022-03-18T02:06:15.000Z,"Mariana Zlahodniuk spent days trying to persuade her mother, Olena, to get out of Ukraine.  ""She wouldn't come, was adamant in fact,"" says Mariana, a 27-year-old marketing and business adviser from Ukraine, based in the Polish capital since 2012. The pair's hometown of Zhmerinka, in central-southern Ukraine, is a strategic railway point and the frontline of the Russian invasion is edging closer. Mariana's phone calls became more desperate, until, finally, Olena decided to make the hazardous journey to cross the border to safety in Poland.  Olena's mother, Mariana's 73-year-old grandmother, meanwhile, is left in their house in the small town. ""She calls me every day and tells me to come home and tend to the garden,"" Olena adds. Mariana eventually picked up her mum on the Polish side of the border on 26 February after a complicated journey - half of it on a slow train to Lviv with the lights turned off - to avoid attracting attention from the Russian military forces.  ""I will go home as soon as I can and will do what I can to help, for example cooking for the soldiers,"" Olena says, when we meet in a cafe in Warsaw. ""I will have to hide her passport,"" Mariana laughs.  When she arrived to collect her mother, Mariana says she was immediately struck by the lack of food and help available for the stream of refugees crossing at the border town of Korczowa and decided to act.  After phoning round her friends in the marketing and business community, she was quickly overwhelmed by offers of help.  She joined forces with an Afghan refugee-turned-restaurant owner, Harry Parwani, a friend from Krakow. His catering company, Vegan Ramen AF, has stepped in with its portable kitchen to help provide free food for up to 8,000 people a day at the border.   A Swiss investor then also funded more than â¬10,000 ($11,000; Â£8,398) of food shopping, and Mariana spent about 10,000 zlotys ($2,357; Â£1,765) of her own money supporting the work before charity organisations stepped in.  Mariana now employs 20 people as cooks and helpers, providing transportation and running a hotel. Shifts rotate every three to four days as the work is gruelling and some refuse to be paid, she says.  ""Bakers sell me bread below market prices, firms bring in the food for free, companies offer free transportation and drivers. It's an extraordinary effort.""  'We want to provide support at all stages'  Polish businesses have mobilised quickly to help refugees. Two million have already arrived here. ""We will help as long as it will be required,"" says Krzysztof Inglot, founder of Poland's largest recruitment firm, Personnel Service. ""We know that refugees at different stages of their stay in Poland will need different support. At the beginning, it is mostly transport, accommodation, and psychological support. The next stage is settling down, finding work and integration with Polish society. We want to provide support at all these stages,"" he says. National railway company PKP Intercity is offering free travel for refugees, while Maciej Panek, chief executive of vehicle hire firm Panek has donated 1,000 rental cars to transport people away from the border. Transport firm FlixBus, meanwhile, has provided refugees with free buses on routes from the border. The company also joined UA Talents - a jobs platform launched by two Berlin-based Ukrainian entrepreneurs that will help refugees find jobs. Meanwhile, Poland's largest private healthcare company, Lux Med, has offered urgent free medical assistance to refugees. And mobile phone operators Play, Orange, Plus and T-Mobile are reducing the costs of telephone calls to the main Ukrainian operators, Kyivstar, Vodafone and Lifecell. Helping the refugees sort out their finances will also become an important part of support - banks in Poland have already removed fees for money transfers to Ukraine and commissions for cash deposits and ATM withdrawals. Mr Inglot is optimistic, he says his recruitment company data suggests the labour market in Poland could absorb 500,000 employees within the next six months and another 200,000 after that, due to an acute shortage of workers in many sectors.  ""We estimate that about 30% have travelled to other countries, so can say about half a million people may want to join the labour market. That is good news for employers who need employees,"" he says. A labour market study from Poland's Central Statistics Office shows firms need 93,000 industrial workers, 85,000 IT specialists, and 61,000 operators and assemblers of machines and devices, and a further 52,000 service sector employees. Michael Dembinski, chief adviser to the British Polish Chamber of Commerce (BPCC), agrees. ""Our members have been held back by a lack of workers in Poland."" He describes an outflow of men from sectors such as construction, logistics and IT, but is hopeful hospitality, retail, the care sector, agriculture and horticulture will now gain more staff. Smaller firms  This rapid response has not been limited to the biggest companies: smaller firms are also pitching in. HerImpact, a recruitment agency in Warsaw, is working for free to help women arriving from Ukraine create new CVs, apply for jobs and translate documents into Polish and English, says chief brand officer Dionizy Wincenty Placzkowski. ""Many Poles have opened their hearts and houses to provide support to people in need,"" says Agata Zeman, managing director of the 24/7 media agency in Warsaw. The agency has donated part of its office to Flying Bag Foundation which is helping refugees, especially teenagers, organise their lives in Warsaw. ""I am proud of our people, who from the first minute, were united in solidarity and support for Ukraine. Like many other firms, we have given our team time to volunteer."" A Polish foundation that connects IT companies with non-governmental organisations - TechForUkraine - was launched the day before Russia's invasion and within two weeks had 450 firms signed up and 30 projects launched.  ""IT companies have these 'superpowers' and want to use them for good,"" says Jacek Siadkowski, director of TechForUkraine. ""Young people coming into the sector in Poland often work on strategies for selling sausages or something, and this campaign really galvanised them."" Mr Siadkowski says TechForUkraine is working on an ""Airbnb-style"" web platform, to help Ukrainians find accommodation. He says the platform called, uaSOS.org, is being developed by BCG, ID Advisory, Clevsoft and several dozens volunteers pro bono. Ties between UK and Poland   Mr Dembicki says many of the BPCC's members - one third are large UK-based businesses investing in Poland - have pledged some kind of support, some financial. He says many of the UK's 52 chambers of commerce also want to help, offering English language lessons online.  ""As soon as we heard about the war in Ukraine, I asked friends to start a collection of humanitarian aid, so together with Katarzyna Mazurkiewicz and volunteers we organised it,"" says Irina Nowosielska from the Polish British Social Integration Club, Wawel, a charity based in West London. ""There are a lot of good people around. It's just unbelievable how many people help us to help Ukraine,"" Ms Nowosielska says. Back in Warsaw however, Olena Zlahodniuk, is already itching to go home. ""I am extremely grateful to the Polish people for helping, but this is our fight and we will win,"" she says.

Lupin: Seven charged over armed heist on Paris filming set,2022-03-19T05:17:36.000Z,"Seven people have been charged after an armed robbery was staged last month on the French film set of hit Netflix series 'Lupin'. Around twenty hooded thieves attacked the film crew by launching fireworks at them, a Netflix spokesperson said. They stole more than â¬300,000 (Â£250,000; $330,000) worth of equipment during the heist, in broad daylight. None of the cast or crew who were on set - reported to include the show's star Omar Sy - were injured. The crew were attacked while they were filming in the Nanterre district, west of central Paris, forcing production to briefly pause. The seven accused, aged between 13 and 21, now face charges of armed robbery as part of an organised gang and receiving stolen goods, according to Agence France-Presse.  Three of them are being held in custody while four are under judicial supervision. Police say they are still looking for more of the assailants, and have recovered some of the stolen equipment. Gang jailed for celebrity burglaries in ParisWoman arrested over jewellery thefts from coffins Inspired by the fictional French master of disguise ArsÃ¨ne Lupin, the show tells the tale of professional thief Assane Diop who is played by Omar Sy. The show's first season, released last year, was watched by millions around the world and is the first French series to enjoy such huge success on Netflix. Lupin is not the only high-profile Netflix production to be targeted by thieves this year.  The day before the Paris heist, robbers in South Yorkshire in the UK stole more than 200 antique props from the set of The Crown TV series. The stolen items were valued up to Â£150,000 and included a replica of a FabergÃ© egg which was owned by the Queen's grandfather George V in 1933."
When will free Covid tests end across the UK and can I buy LFTs?,2022-03-28T08:17:42.000Z,"Most people in England won't get free PCR or lateral flow tests (LFTs) after 1 April. However, some free testing will continue in Scotland until the end of April, and in Wales until the end of June.  Free LFTs won't be available after 1 April, except for the over-75s and over-12s with weakened immune systems. Portsmouth City Council plans to offer local residents five LFTs a month until the end of June.  Everyone else will have to buy tests.  The number of free NHS tests distributed each day in England has been capped.  People without symptoms can now only order one pack of seven LFTs every three days - previously it was one per day.  The NHS test ordering website has also been updated to say that most people in England without symptoms no longer need to test, and that LFTs are needed for those at higher risk. Due to rising demand, the website regularly says that no LFTs are available, but more tests are released across the day so people who want to order tests should keep trying.  Free PCR tests won't be available to people with Covid symptoms from April either, except for a small number of at-risk groups, with details to be announced. Free testing will remain for social care workers with Covid symptoms and NHS staff but these may not be funded separately.  An axe has been taken to testing - does it matter?Look familiar? How rapid tests changed the pandemic Yes. High street pharmacies are charging about Â£2 per test. The government has a list of private test providers.  Some free testing will be available until the end of April:  From 18 April: free LFTs won't be available to the general populationfree LFTs will be available to those people still asked to test, such as health/care workers, patients, or those visiting vulnerable individuals in care homes or hospitals Until 30 April:  people with Covid symptoms should self-isolate and get a PCR testvaccinated close contacts of positive cases should do daily LFTs for seven days From 1 May:  people with Covid symptoms won't need to testphysical test sites will close and contact tracing will end Scottish government: Update on changes to the Covid regulations Wales will keep some free testing capacity until the end of June:  PCR tests won't be freely availablefree LFTs will be available for people with symptomspeople should isolate if positivecontact tracing will continue After then, free LFTs won't be available, contact tracing and self-isolation support payments will end, and self-isolation guidance will be updated to advise ill people to stay at home. Northern Ireland says a review of future testing arrangements is ""ongoing"", and the system won't change until that finishes.  Across the UK, anyone without Covid symptoms can order one box of LFTs every three days using their NHS login. You can also collect LFTs from pharmacies, and vaccination/test centres, but should register online to get a ""collection code"" first.  You should report all LFT results online, or via 119. People with symptoms can order a home PCR test kit, or book an appointment at a test site. People in England don't need to self-isolate or take daily tests after contact with someone with Covid, regardless of their vaccination status. Contact tracing has ended.  Across the rest of the UK, if you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland) you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or for 10 days after your last contact, if earlier).  If any LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate.  Close contacts of positive cases who aren't fully vaccinated must self-isolate for 10 days.  In Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms. Anyone who develops symptoms should take a PCR test.  Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? Staff and students in most education/childcare settings in England no longer have to test regularly. Arrangements for NHS staff should be confirmed in March. In the rest of the UK, NHS and education staff are still asked to test twice a week. Secondary pupils should test twice a week during term time (three times in Wales).  Everyone in Scotland is still advised to test regularly until 18 April.  You may still need to test before or after travelling abroad. You must buy private tests for this - you can't use free NHS tests.   LFTs and PCR tests do different things: LFTs detect material from the surface proteins of the virusPCRs detect genetic material of the virus which can be present in the body for several weeks after somebody is actually capable of passing it on Both tests involve swabbing your nose and/or throat. LFTs can be done at home, and show results in 20 to 30 minutes.  PCR test swabs must be sent to a lab for analysis, with results generally provided in 24 to 48 hours. Being vaccinated against Covid cannot cause you to test positive on either an LFT or PCR test."

Russia denies cosmonauts board space station in Ukrainian colours,2022-03-19T19:13:35.000Z,"Russia's space agency has rejected claims that three Russian cosmonauts boarded the International Space Station wearing Ukrainian colours, in a possible statement against the war. The first arrivals since Russia's war began were shown wearing bright yellow suits with blue trimmings. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their fellow American, Russian and German crew. ""Sometimes yellow is just yellow,"" said the Roscosmos space agency. The ISS is a joint project between Russia, America, Canada, Japan and several European countries. It is led by a US-Russian partnership that has continued for two decades despite fluctuating tensions between the two world powers. Russian cosmonauts Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov docked at the ISS after a three-hour flight which blasted off from a Russian-owned facility in Kazakhstan. ""Congratulations on the successful docking,"" a voice from Russia's mission control said. A few hours later, two sets of hatches were opened and the three smiling men floated into the space station one by one in their yellow suits. The standard-issue Russian uniform is plain blue, and at least one of the men was seen wearing this before take-off. The moment was live-streamed by both Roscosmos and Nasa, the American space agency. ""It became our turn to pick a colour,"" Mr Artemyev said when he was asked about the suits in a live-streamed press conference. ""We had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it,"" he joked. ""That's why we had to wear yellow."" Since the invasion of Ukraine, people around the world have used the colours of its national flag to show solidarity and support. But Roscosmos's press service dismissed the reports as a ""funny invention"" by foreign bloggers and media. ""The flight suits of the new crew are made in the colours of the emblem of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which all three cosmonauts graduated from... To see the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is crazy."" The head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, is a strong supporter of the invasion and he suggested the claims that the cosmonauts were wearing Ukrainian colours had come from Ukrainian nationalists. Roscosmos later published another picture of Oleg Artemyev wearing an obviously Russian suit. The three Russians will begin a science mission on the ISS that is set to last just over six months. They will replace three current crew members who are scheduled to fly back to Earth on 30 March. The colours certainly speak to the moment, but what is the real motivation in wearing them? Does it signal support for Ukraine or the opposite? After all, the suits do display Russian flags.  Perhaps neither view is correct.  It has been suggested that the colours are a reflection of the fact that all three cosmonauts attended the Bauman Moscow State Technical University which has a similar colour scheme.  It's a ""Bauman crew"", the university has been trumpeting.  The cosmonauts themselves, however, said noticeably little. What we do know is that 400km (248 miles) above the Earth, East and West have no choice but to continue friendly relations.  While space co-operation is falling apart elsewhere - witness the ExoMars rover, for example - on the ISS the partners are joined at the hip. Russia provides the propulsion for the station, the Americans provide the power. The ISS cannot exist without either party. "
William and Kate arrive in Belize for jubilee Caribbean tour,2022-03-20T08:21:42.000Z,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have arrived in Belize for their week-long tour of the Caribbean - their first joint overseas trip since the start of the pandemic. The couple were all smiles as they stepped off the plane following an 11-hour flight from the UK. They were welcomed by Belize's governor general ahead of a meeting with Prime Minister Johnny Briceno. But part of their tour has been axed amid reported opposition from locals. The trip is to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee this year, and will see William and Catherine also visit Jamaica and the Bahamas. The royal couple were greeted by a guard of honour from the Belize Defence Force as they landed at Belize City's Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport. After military tunes were played by the unit's band, William inspected the personnel. Later in the day, Catherine and William met Mr Briceno and his wife Rossana. The prime minister told the couple: ""We're so happy you're here.""  A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said the couple were ""very much looking forward to visiting the Caribbean region"" and to having the opportunity to thank communities across Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas for the support they had shown the Queen. However, a visit to the Akte 'il Ha cacao farm in Indian Creek village, in the foothills of the Maya Mountains, has been removed from the couple's schedule.  A protest opposing the trip took place on Friday, according to reports. Belize media outlet Channel 7 said there was a claimed dispute between residents of Indian Creek village and Fauna and Flora International (FFI), which has William as patron, over land owned by the conservation organisation. There were also reported to be concerns about the landing site earmarked for the Cambridges' helicopter, with residents claiming they were not consulted about the location, a local football pitch. A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm that due to sensitive issues involving the community in Indian Creek, the visit has been moved to a different location - further details will be provided in due course."" The Belize government said in a statement: ""Indian Creek was one of several sites being considered. Due to issues in the village, the government of Belize activated its contingency planning and another venue has been selected to showcase Maya family entrepreneurship in the cacao industry.""  And a spokesman for FFI said the charity would ""support the livelihoods, educational opportunities and the customary rights of local people"" as part of its project in the area. ""We are establishing a dialogue with key stakeholders about the future ownership and management of land and want to work with - and in support of - the indigenous community, respecting traditional Mayan rights,"" he added. The trip has been replaced with a similar visit that will see them tour a chocolate producer on Sunday. They will later travel to the cultural centre of the Garifuna community in Hopkins, a beachfront village.  They will also spend time learning about efforts to preserve Belize's barrier reef. Among other highlights of their Caribbean tour will be a sailing regatta in the Bahamas in honour of the Queen's 70-year reign, which is expected to see the couple renew their friendly sporting rivalry when they take to the water. Their tour will also see them celebrate Jamaica's musical and sporting heritage. "
"Clerkenwell: Woman, 19, killed at student accommodation",2022-03-19T16:17:13.000Z,"A 19-year-old woman has been killed at student accommodation in central London. She was found with serious injuries when police and medics were called to Arbour House in Sebastian Street, Clerkenwell, at about 05:10 GMT. The teenager, who is believed to have been a student, was later pronounced dead at the scene, the Met Police said. A murder investigation has been launched and detectives are trying to identify the woman's next of kin. No arrests have been made and a police presence remains at the scene. Ch Insp Adam Instone, of the Met Police, said he understood the student community would be concerned.

Coronavirus treatments: What progress is being made?,2022-03-15T09:11:26.000Z,"Vaccines have transformed the pandemic, but there is still a huge need for drugs which can treat Covid. Immunity from vaccines can wane, and access is still a major problem around the world. Also, new variants emphasise the possible need for a back-up.   There are now many drugs that target the virus or our body in different ways: anti-inflammatory drugs that stop our immune system overreacting with deadly consequencesanti-viral drugs that make it harder for the coronavirus to replicate inside the bodyantibody therapies that mimic our own immune system to attack the virus These are all needed at different stages of the infection. They range from dirt cheap to spectacularly expensive, and some are more resilient to new variants than others. When you catch Covid, your body releases a flood of chemicals to warn that you're under attack.  This chemical alarm is called inflammation, and is vital for rallying your immune system to boot out Covid.  But if you don't get rid of the virus quickly, then inflammation can spiral out of control and eventually damage vital organs such as your lungs. It's this excessive inflammation that kills. An anti-inflammatory steroid that already existed before Covid - dexamethasone - was the first drug proved to save the lives of people with Covid.  It's given to seriously ill patients with breathing troubles - it cuts the risk of death by a fifth for patients on oxygen, and by a third for those on ventilators.  It is also so cheap that it has become the go-to drug around the world - with everywhere from Brazil to China using it. Other anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to work, including the steroid hydrocortisone and baricitinib, which is normally used in rheumatoid arthritis. There are more advanced and targeted anti-inflammatory drugs such as tocilizumab and sarilumab. Tocilizumab has been widely used in hospitals in China, India and Australia. These are also effective, but up to 100 times as expensive as dexamethasone. This has restricted their use - although they are still cheaper than an intensive care bed.  Anti-inflammatories work best later on in the disease, but an asthma drug called budesonide has been shown to help vulnerable people with early Covid symptoms recover more quickly at home. An anti-viral directly targets the ability of the coronavirus to make copies of itself inside our bodies. Such a drug keeps levels of the virus in the body low, so there is less of it for your immune system to deal with. Paxlovid is a pill taken twice a day for five days - according to its maker, Pfizer, it cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by 89% in vulnerable adultsMolnupiravir stops the virus from making effective copies of itself - the manufacturer, Merck, estimates it cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half Both Paxlovid and molnupiravir are best taken soon after symptoms appear. Pfizer expects to make 80 million courses of Paxlovid by the end of 2022 and has said it will allow generic makers in 95 low-income nations to produce and distribute it at cost price. Merck is allowing Indian generic drug firms to turn out molnupiravir cheaply for 100 low and middle-income countries.  Another anti-viral, remdesivir, is given through a drip and cuts recovery time from Covid.  The third approach is to give people an infusion of antibodies that can attack the virus. These stick to the surface of the coronavirus and mark it for destruction by the body's immune system.  The body makes its own antibodies when it is attacked by coronavirus. The most effective of these have been studied in the lab, grown and given to patients. This is known as monoclonal antibody therapy. Vulnerable NHS patients to be offered new drug These therapies are often reserved for seriously ill patients who are struggling to make their own antibodies. Ronapreve, by Regeneron and Roche, reduces the length of hospital stays and the risk of death Sotrovimab, made by GSK, reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death by 79% in high-risk adults A different monoclonal antibody treatment called Evushield, made by AstraZeneca, is recommended for some vulnerable people to hopefully prevent disease before they show any signs of being infected. This is known as prophylactic therapy.  Anti-inflammatories should work against all variants because they target our own bodies, rather than the virus itself. There is more concern about whether monoclonal antibodies would work with new variants, as they rely on being a close match for the virus. If a new variant is heavily mutated then it theoretically makes the drugs weaker.  However, GSK says it has tested its therapy against the Omicron variant and it remains effective in laboratory studies. Anti-virals are expected to hold up against the variants seen so far. None of the mutations seen in Omicron should affect the ability of the drugs to work. However, if the drugs are used widely then there is the potential for drug resistance to emerge. A number of drugs have been heralded as potential therapies for Covid - sometimes with no sign that they actually make any difference.  Ivermectin has been controversially promoted for use in many parts of the world, despite no evidence that it works. Taking antibodies from survivors' blood - known as convalescent plasma therapy - has been touted, but has not reduced deaths. There was also speculation that drugs used to treat malaria and HIV might work, but this has come to nothing. Follow James on Twitter"

Ukraine war: 'Tanks in streets' as fighting hits Mariupol centre,2022-03-19T13:43:37.000Z,"Efforts to rescue hundreds of people trapped in the basement of a bombed theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol are being hampered by intense battles in the area, the mayor says. Vadym Boychenko told the BBC teams were only able to clear the rubble of the building during lulls in the fighting. Ukrainian officials say Russia attacked the site, which was clearly marked as a civilian shelter. Moscow denies it. Russian forces have encircled the city, which has no electricity, water or gas. About 300,000 people are trapped inside, as food and medical supplies run out and Russia blocks the entry of humanitarian aid. Russian attacks have hit a hospital, a church and countless apartment blocks, with local officials estimating that about 80% of residential buildings are either damaged or destroyed, a third of them beyond repair.  Mariupol has seen some of the fiercest battles since Russia invaded Ukraine, three weeks ago. The location of the port city, on the Sea of Azov, is strategic for Russia, as it would help it create a land corridor between the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, controlled by Russian-backed separatists, and Crimea, the peninsula it invaded and annexed in 2014. ""[There is] street fighting in the city centre,"" Mr Boychenko said, confirming a claim made by Russia on Friday, when it said it was ""tightening the noose"" around the city. ""There are tanks... and artillery shelling, and all kinds of weapons fired in the area,"" the mayor said. ""Our forces are doing everything they can to hold their positions in the city but the forces of the enemy are larger than ours, unfortunately."" Communication with the city is difficult, with the phone network said to be operational only a few hours a day. Amid unrelenting Russian attacks, residents spend most of their days in shelters and basements, rarely coming outside.  Mr Boychenko said, in a previous interview, that there was no city centre left. ""There isn't a small piece of land in the city that doesn't have signs of war,"" he said. The intense fighting means it is too dangerous for teams to clear the rubble of the destroyed theatre and rescue people from the basement, which withstood Wednesday's attack. ""There's no opportunity to do that,"" Mr Boychenko said. ""When it gets quiet for a bit, rubble is being cleared and people get out."" He said he could not provide an update on how many had already left the site. A day earlier, the country's human rights ombudsman said 130 people had been rescued, and that about 1,300 remained trapped. Satellite images showed the Russian word for ""children"" had been emblazoned on the ground in two locations outside the imposing Soviet-era building, indicating the place was being used as a civilian shelter. Most of those inside are elderly people, women and children, who are living squeezed in dark rooms and corridors. In a video address released on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said some of the people rescued were ""seriously wounded"" but that, at the moment, there was no information of deaths. President Zelensky also accused Russia of a ""war crime"" for blocking the access of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities. ""This is a totally deliberate tactic,"" he said. ""They [Russian forces] have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an 'argument' for Ukrainians to co-operate with the occupiers."" The authorities in Mariupol say at least 2,500 people have been killed in the city since the start of the war, although they acknowledge that is an underestimate. Some of the dead are being left on streets, as it is too risky to collect them. Many end up being buried in mass graves. Mr Boychenko, the Mariupol mayor, said 40,000 people had managed to leave the city in the last five days, and that 20,000 others were waiting to be evacuated. Residents are fleeing in private vehicles, he said, as attempts to create official humanitarian corridors have broken down, with Ukraine accusing Russia of attacking the city despite agreeing to ceasefires.

Russia claims first use of hypersonic Kinzhal missile in Ukraine,2022-03-19T14:08:37.000Z,"Russia's military has fired a hypersonic ballistic missile and destroyed a big underground arms depot in western Ukraine, the defence ministry in Moscow has said. If confirmed it would be Russia's first use in this war of the Kinzhal, or Dagger, ballistic missile launched from the air, most likely by a MiG-31 warplane. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly highlighted Russia's investment in hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. The statistics are impressive: according to Russian officials the Kinzhal can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h. But does that make them any more dangerous than other missiles or even artillery which can cause just as much death and destruction? ""I don't view it as that significant,"" says James Acton, nuclear policy specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""I don't know how much of an advantage Russia is getting from using hypersonic missiles."" President Putin boasted last December that Russia was leading the world in hypersonic missiles, which are hard to track because they can change direction while mid-flight. Russia posted a video of what it said was its missile strike on the arms depot in Deliatyn, a village in south-western Ukraine only 100km from the border with Romania. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter ""It's a sign of showmanship. Even if it's used we should consider it as an isolated moment because Russia doesn't have a large number of these missiles,"" said Dominika Kunertova of the Center for Security Studies in Zurich. The Russian leader unveiled the Kinzhal four years ago as one of a series of ""invincible"" weapons that he said would evade enemy defences. The other hypersonic missiles are the Zirkon and the Avangard, which is both faster and has a far greater range. The Kinzhal can carry a nuclear warhead as well as a conventional one and recent reports said MiG-31 fighters had been sent to Kaliningrad, bringing numerous European capitals within reach. There is no indication from where the attack on the arms depot was launched. ""It's a signal to the West, because Putin is annoyed that the West is daring to shift all these weapons [to Ukraine],"" Ms Kunertova told the BBC. ""It's questionable that it's so accurate, so it's not a game changer."" LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyANALYSIS: Putin's redrawn the world - but not as he wantedBATTLEFIELD: What have been Russia's military mistakes?WATCH: Drone footage shows Mariupol devastationLISTEN: What are hypersonic missiles? James Acton said the Kinzhal was thought to be an Iskander missile that had been modified for fighter jets, and Iskander-M missiles have already been fired by Russian ground launchers since the start of the war. Although the Iskander-M has a far shorter range than the air-launched missile, Ukraine's defence ministry claimed this week that Russia had fired almost all its Iskander missiles during the first 20 days of the war.  A US defence official was quoted as saying on Friday that Russian forces had fired more than 1,080 missiles since 24 February. ""[That] is an astonishing number and a very significant fraction of Russia's pre-war inventory,"" Mr Acton told the BBC, pointing to the increasing use of unguided bombs in Russian aerial attacks. ""They may very well be running short of accurate munitions."" "

Ukraine war: Boris Johnson sparks fury after comparison to Brexit,2022-03-20T15:57:03.000Z,"Boris Johnson has been criticised for comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting Russia's invasion to people in Britain voting for Brexit. In a speech he said Britons, like Ukrainians, had the instinct ""to choose freedom"" and cited the 2016 vote to leave the EU as a ""recent example"". The comments have caused anger among politicians both in the UK and Europe. Donald Tusk, the former president of the European Council, called the comments offensive. Conservative peer Lord Barwell said voting in a referendum was not ""in any way comparable with risking your life"" in a war, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was an ""insult"" to Ukrainians. The row comes as the prime minister strongly urged China to condemn the Russian invasion in an interview with the Sunday Times. He suggested Beijing was having ""second thoughts"" about its neutral stance. Mr Johnson likened the Ukrainians' fight to Brexit in a speech to the Conservative Party's spring conference in Blackpool on Saturday. He said: ""I know that it's the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom, every time. I can give you a couple of famous recent examples. ""When the British people voted for Brexit in such large, large numbers, I don't believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners.  ""It's because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself."" LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyANALYSIS: Putin's redrawn the world - but not as he wantedBATTLEFIELD: What have been Russia's military mistakes?WATCH: Drone footage shows Mariupol devastationIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the war Mr Johnson also cited as an example British people choosing to get vaccinated against coronavirus because they ""wanted to get on with their lives"" and ""were fed up with being told what to do by people like me"". But his remarks, intended to rally the Tory faithful, attracted criticism from political figures in the UK and Europe. Mr Tusk tweeted ""Boris, your words offend Ukrainians, the British and common sense"", while Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, said the comparison was ""insane"". Asked about Mr Johnson linking the plight of Ukraine to Brexit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""I don't think the prime minister was making a direct comparison between these two things - clearly they're not directly analogous.""   ""He was making some general observations about people's desire for freedom,"" he added.  Mr Sunak said the prime minister had been galvanising global opinion to send a strong message to Vladimir Putin, and ""that's the thing we should be focused on"".  Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves called for the prime minister to withdraw his comments and apologise. She told the BBC: ""The people of Ukraine, who are fighting for their lives - in any way to draw a parallel to voting to leave the European Union, it is shameless.""  She pointed out that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wanted to join the EU - and that ""he clearly sees no such parallel"".  PM tells Zelensky that UK will do more to helpWhat's driving Putin? Agents seek to get inside his head Lord Barwell, who served as Theresa May's chief of staff in No 10, said: ""Apart from the bit where voting in a free and fair referendum isn't in any way comparable with risking your life to defend your country against invasion, and the awkward fact the Ukrainians are fighting for the freedom to join the EU, this comparison is bang on."" Ukraine applied for fast-track membership of the European Union last month, shortly after the Russian invasion.  Mr Zelensky said on Friday he had spoken to the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and expected progress to be made on its application in the coming months. Others who criticised Mr Johnson's comments included Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, who tweeted: ""Comparing the Ukrainian people's fight against Putin's tyranny to the British people voting for Brexit damages the standard of statecraft we were beginning to exhibit."" The Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed called the prime minister a ""national embarrassment"", adding: ""To compare a referendum to women and children fleeing Putin's bombs is an insult to every Ukrainian. He is no Churchill: he is Basil Fawlty."" SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Mr Johnson's comments were ""crass and distasteful"". Meanwhile in his interview with the Times, Mr Johnson has urged China to join in the global condemnation of Vladimir Putin's invasion. He warned Beijing that supporting Russia was akin to choosing the wrong side in World War Two, describing it as a battle between good and evil.  Mr Johnson told the paper that he believed some in Xi Jinping's administration were having ""second thoughts"" about the neutral stance adopted by Beijing. It comes just a few days after the US warned China that it would face consequences if it helped Russia evade sanctions. ""As time goes on, and as the number of Russian atrocities mounts up, I think it becomes steadily more difficult and politically embarrassing for people either actively or passively to condone Putin's invasion,"" Mr Johnson said. ""There are considerable dilemmas now for people who thought they could sit this one out, who thought they could sit on the fence."""
Six killed after car drives into crowd in Belgium,2022-03-20T14:06:02.000Z,"At least six people have been killed after a car drove into a crowd of carnival-goers in southern Belgium. The incident happened in the small town of StrÃ©py-Bracquegnies, about 30 miles (50km) south of the capital Brussels. The car drove at high-speed into dozens of people who were preparing to take part in a traditional parade on Sunday morning. Around 40 people were injured and several are in a serious condition, the town's mayor said. ""There were about 150-200 people who were following the parade and [the] car arrived from behind and drove into the crowd,"" Jacques Gobert said. ""It continued for another 100m (328ft),"" he added. ""It should be considered a national catastrophe."" The exact circumstances of the attack are being investigated, but police said a terror attack had been ruled out. ""It is an accident, a tragic one. The car hit the group and tried to carry on but it was quickly stopped by the police,"" police spokeswoman Cristina Ianoco told the BBC. ""The driver and the other people in the car have been detained,"" she added. They have not been identified. Police denied earlier reports in some Belgian media that the crash, which happened at around 05:00 local time (04:00 GMT), followed a high-speed police chase. ""Deepest condolences to the families and friends of those killed and injured in the incident this morning,"" Belgian Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden wrote on Twitter. ""What was supposed to be a great party turned into a tragedy,"" she added. Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, who is expected to visit the scene later on Sunday, said it was ""horrible news"". ""A community gathering to celebrate has been hit in the heart,"" he said. Belgian towns and villages host traditional street carnivals around the period of Lent.  The event in StrÃ©py-Bracquegnies, like many others, features a parade with participants dressed up comical figures."
"I will help with costs where I can, says Chancellor Rishi Sunak",2022-03-20T12:43:51.000Z,"The chancellor has pledged to help ""where we can make a difference"", as he faces pressure to help households with soaring living costs. Ahead of next week's Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak told the BBC he would ""stand by"" people, but warned sanctions against Russia were not ""cost-free"". He is facing calls from some Tory MPs to cut fuel duty to help ease rising costs at the pumps. His Labour counterpart Rachel Reeves said her party would back such a move. But the shadow chancellor said the government should also be taxing oil and gas companies to fund more generous energy discounts for poorer families. And she repeated Labour's call for ministers to scrap the 1.25 percentage point hike in National Insurance, which is due to begin in April.  Why is the cost of living going up?People 'facing choice between food and energy'What Tory MPs want from Sunak The Spring Statement is not usually an occasion to announce big tax and spending decisions. However, this year Mr Sunak is facing pressure to act on living standards amid soaring energy costs and rising household bills due to increasing inflation.  Personal finance expert Martin Lewis said the squeeze facing households was worse than during the Covid pandemic or after the 2008 financial crash. He told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme he was ""virtually out of tools to help people now"" - and said more ""political intervention"" was required. Speaking to the same programme, Mr Sunak said he would not be able to ""fully protect"" people from the consequences of rising prices. But asked whether he was prepared to step in and offer support, he added: ""Of course I am, and people can judge me by my actions over the past two years."" He added: ""I want to be honest with people that it's not going to be easy. ""I wish government could solve absolutely every problem and that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead.  ""I can't do that, but what I would say is I will stand by them in the same way that I have done in the past couple of years."" Millions of household are facing sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government's price cap is set to rise. The higher cap means typical households face paying Â£1,971 a year from April, 54% more than they pay now, with a further rise expected in October. The price of petrol and diesel is also on the rise, worsened by a surge in oil costs due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Rising inflation, which the Bank of England has warned could hit about 7% this year, is also pushing up costs of food, clothing and transport. EXPLAINED: Why are energy bills so high?PRICES: Cost of petrol hits fresh recordWARNING: UK faces biggest income squeeze in decadesAPPEAL: Campaigner says families need urgent help Mr Sunak is facing calls from more than 50 MPs to cut fuel duty, which has been frozen for over a decade, to reduce the price of petrol and diesel. Others within his party have been calling for the government to scrap VAT on energy bills - while some want green levies removed to reduce costs. The chancellor said he could not ""speculate"" on tax decisions, but added that the government was already ""taking action"" over energy bills.  He pointed to support announced in April - including a Â£150 rebate on council tax for people living in properties in bands A-D, about 80% of households. A Â£200 energy bill discount is also due to apply in October - although Labour has criticised it as a ""buy now, pay later scheme"" as people will have to pay the discount back over five years from 2023. Shadow chancellor Ms Reeves said Labour would support a cut to fuel duty - currently 57.95p per litre of petrol or diesel - but told Sky News the move did not ""rise to the scale of the challenge we face"". She told the BBC her ""priority"" would be reversing next month's National Insurance rise, and increasing corporation tax on oil and gas firms to fund more generous support for energy bills through the Warm Home Discount scheme."
"P&O Ferries' sackings were appalling, says Sunak",2022-03-20T17:41:11.000Z,"P&O Ferries' sacking of 800 staff without warning last week was ""awful"" and ""wrong"", Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told the BBC. The government is examining the legality of the firm's actions, the chancellor confirmed. However, the Sunday Times reports that ministers knew of the plan to sack crew beforehand, but failed to challenge it. The Department for Transport said ""full details"" were not available at that stage. A memo sent to ministers by a senior Whitehall official - and seen by the Sunday Times - outlined P&O Ferries' strategy before the sackings took place, the newspaper said. According to the Sunday Times, the note said the sackings were designed to ensure P&O remained ""a key player in the UK market for years to come through restructuring"". The memo, as reported in the newspaper, said: ""We understand that P&O Ferries have an intention to try and re-employ many staff on new terms and conditions or use agency staff to restart routes; they estimate disruption to services lasting 10 days."" It was circulated before Thursday's announcement, made over Zoom, telling 800 P&O staff that they were losing their jobs with immediate effect. The news was met with outrage from trades unions representing crew and ministers responded with strong criticism, announcing they would review all government contracts with the firm. Mr Sunak, speaking to Sophie Raworth on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, said P&O's approach was ""appalling in the way that they've treated their workers"". P&O Ferries' job cuts a 'PR disaster', say expertsP&O jobs agency says it did not know of sackingsAre the P&O Ferries sackings legal? The government does not appear to have voiced concerns directly to P&O before the sackings. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was standard practice for officials to outline what they had been told by a private firm in an internal memo.  ""This was sent before ministers were advised of the full details and as soon as they were informed, they made clear their outrage at the way in which P&O staff had been dismissed,"" a DfT spokesperson said. The DfT said the memo made clear that the department's priority was to ""work with unions to ensure workers' rights continue to be protected"".  The transport secretary had urged the company to ""sit down with workers and reconsider this action"", the DfT added. Grant Shapps has said he was ""deeply concerned"" at the move. Louise Haigh MP, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: ""This bombshell letter proves that the government was not only aware of P&O ferries' scandalous action - but complicit in it. ""They knew people's livelihoods were on the line and they knew P&O was attempting to use exploitative fire and rehire practices. But they sat back and did nothing."" In a statement, P&O Ferries said: ""We took this difficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn't survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies."" Chris Parker, a director at DFDS, one of P&O's competitors, told the BBC that his company is prepared to hire some of those sacked by P&O Ferries. ""We reduced the capacity of vessels quite sharply during the pandemic because of social distancing. We're increasing that back up again now and we're looking for some staff to come in and help us with that,"" he said. P&O Ferries is owned by Dubai logistics giant DP World which is, in turn, controlled by the Dubai sovereign wealth fund. Last year, DP World's revenue soared by more than a fifth to over Â£3.7bn ($4.9bn) as the global economy began to pick up after coronavirus lockdowns. The company received support of around Â£10m during the pandemic to furlough 1,100 workers. P&O Ferries services remain suspended. "
Sabita Thanwani killing: Manhunt continues over Clerkenwell death,2022-03-20T13:56:37.000Z,"A 19-year-old woman found dead in student accommodation in central London has been identified as police search for a man in connection with her death.  Student Sabita Thanwani was found with neck injuries in the halls of residence in Sebastian Street, Clerkenwell. Police and medics went to Arbour House at about 05:10 GMT on Saturday but she died at the scene. Detectives want to speak to Maher Maaroufe, 22, understood to have been in a relationship with Ms Thanwani. The Metropolitan Police said early indications suggested Ms Thanwani, who attended City, University of London, was with Mr Maaroufe on Friday evening. Woman, 19, killed at student accommodation  Detectives said Mr Maaroufe, who is not a student, had links across London - particularly Marble Arch, Edgware Road and Lewisham - and was also known to travel to Cambridgeshire. Anyone who sees him should not approach him and call 999 immediately, police said. Det Ch Insp Linda Bradley said they believed Tunisian national Mr Maaroufe, of no fixed address, had now shaved his head and had little facial hair. Addressing Mr Maaroufe directly, she said: ""I am also appealing, once again, for Maher Maaroufe to attend a police station immediately.  ""Maher - I am making this appeal directly to you: if you see this, please go to the nearest police station. It is important that we speak with you."" A post-mortem examination has also been arranged. Ch Insp Adam Instone, of the Met Police, said he understood the student community and local people would be concerned.  He said: ""I share their sadness and their concerns. And I can assure them that a thorough homicide investigation is under way, led by skilled and experienced detectives who will work tirelessly to identify and arrest whoever is responsible."" Officers, including forensic specialists, remain at the scene and there will be additional police in the area, Ch Insp Instone said."

Coronavirus: Spring booster offered to elderly and vulnerable in England,2022-03-20T01:27:35.000Z,"Around 600,000 people in England will be invited to book an additional Covid booster this week, as the NHS launches its spring booster programme. The jab is being offered to adults over the age of 75, care home residents and the most vulnerable over-12s. About five million people in the UK will be eligible - with the first invites sent out from Monday. It comes as Covid cases continue to rise across the UK, with an estimated one in every 20 people infected. Last month the UK's vaccines advisers said an extra dose would help top up protection against severe Covid-19, with some immunity likely to be waning. Health Secretary Sajid Javid urged people ""to come forward as soon as you are contacted by the NHS"". Up until now, only people with severely weakened immune systems had been eligible to have four jabs - three doses plus a booster. From Monday, a second booster - to be administered six months after the previous dose - will be offered to: adults aged 75 years and overresidents in a care home for older adultsindividuals aged 12 years and over who are immunosuppressed, or have weakened immune systems Local NHS teams will also offer vaccinations in care homes - with hundreds of visits planned in the coming weeks. Scotland and Wales have already launched their spring booster programmes - under the same terms. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said it expects the spring booster vaccinations to be completed in April and May. Eligible adults will be offered either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, with those aged between 12-18 offered the Pfizer vaccine. NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said efforts to protect the population from coronavirus had not stopped. ""We have protected millions of people at speed, thanks to the efforts of our staff, aided by volunteers. They will once again rise to the next challenge,"" said Ms Pritchard. UK seeing rising number of Covid infectionsLiving with Covid plan to restore our freedom - PMBooster at least 80% effective against severe Omicron  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said vaccinating these groups was a ""precautionary"" move and did not mean there was any current danger to their health. But because people in these groups are at higher risk from Covid-19, have weaker immune systems than other people and were last vaccinated in September or October 2021, so their protection from vaccines might be waning more quickly. ""We must ensure those at greatest risk of serious illness from Covid are protected and spring boosters will top up people's immunity,"" said the government's vaccines minister Maggie Throup. Figures from the Office for National Statistics published on Friday show an estimated one in 20 people are infected. The recent easing of restrictions and waning immunity from vaccines are among the factors believed to be contributing to the rise, with BA.2 - the highly infectious sub-variant of Omicron - now causing most cases. Hospital cases are also rising, but vaccines are still helping to stop many severe cases, say experts. Meanwhile the government continues to defend its Living with Covid strategy, lifting all restrictions in England and putting the onus on vaccinations and personal responsibility. Research by the government estimates that, since mid-December, some 157,000 hospitalisations have been prevented by booster doses, with 32 million top-up jabs given since the rollout began in September 2021. The NHS said it also continues to offer first, second, and third doses for those who are yet to come forward for their Covid vaccine."
Wirral marshland fire may have been started deliberately,2022-03-20T14:00:09.000Z,"A large fire on marshland on the Wirral Peninsula is thought to have been started deliberately. Cheshire Fire Service sent six fire engines to the blaze at Neston after it started just before 18:30 GMT on Saturday. The fire covered about 1 sq km (0.4 sq miles) and was ""mainly extinguished"" by midnight, the fire service said. Cheshire Police said they were keen to speak to a group of teenagers regarding the fire. They said three boys and a girl, aged between 14 and 15, were seen in the area when the blaze began. They said the girl had long dark hair and was wearing a dark jacket and two boys were wearing dark jackets, while the third boy was wearing a light blue jacket and trousers. A police spokeswoman said investigators believed the fire was caused deliberately and they were treating it as arson. Eyewitness Peter Guy, 43, who was visiting nearby Parkgate on a day trip, said he had just finished having fish and chips when he noticed the fire. He said there was no explosion, but the fire took hold rapidly, creating a ""wall of flames"" across the marshland. ""It started off looking like a regular bonfire and then I noticed the fire getting closer to us,"" he said. ""There were so many people there enjoying the beautiful sunset. I've never seen anything like it. It was like the sky was on fire."" On Saturday evening, the fire service said there were two areas of fire spreading around the marshland, a site of special scientific interest.  Fire breaks were put in place to protect nearby properties. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter By 22:00 GMT the huge flames had died down along with the crowds, which earlier lined the Parkgate front, said the BBC's Jon Ironmonger who was at the scene. Hundreds of pubgoers and residents spilled onto the seawall to see the fire, which surged across marshland in the Dee estuary. Cheshire Police said it had received a report about a man being attacked while trying to disperse spectators. A spokeswoman said he sustained a minor injury to his lip.  By midnight, all but one fire engine had been withdrawn to safety as the tide came in, with the fire mainly extinguished. By 07:00 on Sunday, crews confirmed the fire was out by carrying out a sweep of the area with a thermal imaging camera. A spokeswoman for RSPB, which owns the nature reserve, said: ""We're shocked and saddened by the fire that has devastated the Neston Reedbed part of our reserve."" She said marsh harriers were ""beginning to build their nests on the marshland which has sadly been lost to fire"". The reserve hosts wildlife, including bearded tits, Cetti's warblers and bittern.  The RSPB said the scale of the damage was being assessed and thanked the emergency services for their response. Chris Tynan, from RSPB Liverpool, added that the Dee estuary was ""internationally important"" and ""one of the top 10 river estuaries in the UK"". ""There's a huge numbers of birds that come in there because it's got lots of food, it's got lots of habitat. If you dig down into the mud levels, the invertebrates, the food sourcesâ¦ are phenomenal."" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Ukraine conflict: Scores feared dead after Russia attack on Mykolaiv barracks,2022-03-19T15:49:46.000Z,"Scores of Ukrainian soldiers are feared to have been killed after an attack on a military barracks on Friday. About 200 soldiers were sleeping in the barracks when three Russian missiles hit the base on the northern edge of Mykolaiv, a source told the BBC. Some 57 injured people were being treated in hospitals, another source said.  There are no official casualty figures. Rescue workers crawling over giant piles of rubble found a survivor on Saturday - 30 hours after the attack. The man was carried down the steep mountain of rubble in a stretcher and taken away by ambulance towards the city centre. However, the temperature in Mykolaiv last night was minus 6C and it's feared there may not be many more survivors. Vitaly Kim, head of the regional administration, blamed Russians for hitting ""sleeping soldiers with a rocket in a cowardly manner"".  ""At least 50 bodies have been recovered, but we do not know how many others are in the rubble,"" a soldier named Maxim was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. And the rescue work at the site is being carried out amid fears of new Russian attacks. With a crane pulling away chunks of concrete and twisted metal, suddenly soldiers guarding the base shouted at journalists to run for cover, as the sound of a plane, or possibly a missile, could be heard overhead.  Seconds later a dull explosion could be heard somewhere to the north-east. Near the army base is the site of an attack which killed nine civilians queueing outside a shop. There we meet Yulia, who is in tears as she tells the BBC what happened. ""I can't tell you how scared we are,"" she says. ""We all live in the cellar now. When the bombs hit the army base - everything shook."" Two blocks away, Andre Ansimov is trying to clear up from another Russian strike. The crater is so big, a car and a house fell into it.  Only by chance were Andre and his family away when the bomb hit. ""This isn't a war between armies,"" he said. ""The Russians are trying to destroy us all."" Mykolaiv has been blocking Russia's advance west along the Black Sea coast for weeks. Overnight there was more heavy shelling in the south of the city. There are also reports that Russian reconnaissance teams, sent in to locate military targets for attack, have been found there.

Ukraine war: Western agents seek to get inside Putin's head,2022-03-20T00:49:15.000Z,"Russia's leader Vladimir Putin is trapped in a closed world of his own making, Western spies believe. And that worries them. For years they have sought to get inside Mr Putin's mind, to better understand his intentions. With Russian troops seemingly bogged down in Ukraine, the need to do so has become all the more necessary as they try to work out how he will react under pressure. Understanding his state of mind will be vital to avoid escalating the crisis into even more dangerous territory. There has been speculation that Russia's leader was ill, but many analysts believe he has actually become isolated and closed off to any alternative views. His isolation has been evident in pictures of his meetings, such as when he met President Emmanuel Macron, the pair at far ends of a long table. It was also evident in Mr Putin's meeting with his own national security team on the eve of war. Mr Putin's initial military plan looked like something devised by a KGB officer, one Western intelligence official explains. It had been created, they say, by a tight ""conspiratorial cabal"" with an emphasis on secrecy. But the result was chaos. Russian military commanders were not ready and some soldiers went over the border without knowing what they were doing.   Western spies, through sources they will not discuss, knew more about those plans than many inside Russia's leadership. But now they face a new challenge - understanding what Russia's leader will do next. And that is not easy. ""The challenge of understanding the Kremlin's moves is that Putin is the single decision-maker in Moscow,"" explains John Sipher, who formerly ran the CIA's Russia operations. And even though his views are often made clear through public statements, knowing how he will act on them is difficult intelligence challenge. ""It is extremely hard in a system as well protected as Russia to have good intelligence on what's happening inside the head of the leader especially when so many of his own people do not know what is going on,"" Sir John Sawers, a former head of Britain's MI6, told the BBC. Mr Putin, intelligence officials say, is isolated in a bubble of his own making, which very little outside information penetrates, particularly any which might challenge what he thinks.   ""He is a victim of his own propaganda in the sense that he only listens to a certain number of people and blocks out everything else. This gives him a strange view of the world,"" says Adrian Furnham, a professor of psychology and co-author of a forthcoming book The Psychology of Spies and Spying. The risk is what is called ""group think"" in which everyone reinforces his view. ""If he's a victim of group think we need to know who the group is,"" says Prof Furnham. The circle of those Mr Putin talks to has never been large but when it came to the decision to invade Ukraine, it had narrowed to just a handful of people, Western intelligence officials believe, all of those ""true believers"" who share Mr Putin's mindset and obsessions.  Who are the advisors in Vladimir Putin's tight inner circle?  The sense of how small his inner circle has become was emphasised when he publicly dressed down the head of his own Foreign Intelligence Service at the national security meeting just before the invasion - a move which seemed to humiliate the official. His speech hours later also revealed a man angry and obsessed with Ukraine and the West.  Those who have observed him say the Russian leader is driven by a desire to overcome the perceived humiliation of Russia in the 1990s along with a conviction that the West is determined to keep Russia down and drive him from power. One person who met Mr Putin remembers his obsession with watching videos of Libya's Col Gaddafi being killed after he was driven from power in 2011. When the director of the CIA, William Burns, was asked to assess Mr Putin's mental state, he said he had ""been stewing in a combustible combination of grievance and ambition for many years"" and described his views as having ""hardened"" and that he was ""far more insulated"" from other points of view.  Is the Russian president crazy? That is a question many in the West have asked. But few experts consider it helpful. One psychologist with expertise in the area said a mistake was to assume because we cannot understand a decision like invading Ukraine we frame the person who made it as ""mad"".  The CIA has a team which carries out ""leadership analysis"" on foreign decision makers, drawing on a tradition dating back to attempts to understand Hitler. They study background, relationships and health, drawing on secret intelligence. Another source are read-outs from the those who have had direct contact, such as other leaders. In 2014, Angela Merkel reportedly told President Obama that Mr Putin was living ""in another world"". President Macron meanwhile when he sat down with Mr Putin recently, was reported to have found the Russian leader ""more rigid, more isolated"" compared with previous encounters.  Did something change? Some speculate, without much evidence, about possible ill-health or the impact of medication. Others point to psychological factors such as a sense of his own time running out for him to fulfil what he sees as his destiny in protecting Russia or restoring its greatness. The Russian leader has visibly isolated himself from others during the Covid pandemic and this also may have had a psychological impact.  ""Putin is likely not mentally ill, nor he has changed, although he is in more of a hurry, and likely more isolated in recent years,"" says Ken Dekleva, a former US government physician and diplomat, and currently a senior fellow at the George HW Bush Foundation for US-China Relations. But a concern now is that reliable information is still not finding its way into Mr Putin's closed loop. His intelligence services may have been reluctant before the invasion to tell him anything he did not want to hear, offering rosy estimates of how an invasion would go and how Russian troops would be received before the war. And this week one Western official said Mr Putin may still not have the insight into how badly things are going for his own troops that Western intelligence has. That leads to concern about how he might react when confronted with a worsening situation for Russia. Mr Putin himself tells the story of chasing a rat when he was a boy. When he had driven it into a corner, the rat reacted by attacking him, forcing a young Vladimir to become the one who fled. The question Western policymakers are asking is what if Mr Putin feels cornered now?   ""The question really is whether or not he doubles down with greater brutality and escalates in terms of the weapon systems that he's prepared to use,"" said one western official. There have been concerns he could use chemical weapons or even a tactical nuclear weapon. ""The worry is that he does something unbelievably rash in a vicious press-the button way,"" says Adrian Furnham. Mr Putin himself may play up the sense that he is dangerous or even irrational - this is a well-known tactic (often called the ""madman"" theory) in which someone with access to nuclear weapons tries to get his adversary to back down by convincing them that he may well be crazy enough to use them despite the potential for everyone to perish.  For Western spies and policymakers understanding Mr Putin's intentions and mindset today could not be more important. Predicting his response is pivotal in working out how far they can push him without triggering a dangerous reaction. ""Putin's self concept does not allow for failure or weakness. He despises such things"" says Ken Dekleva. ""A cornered, weakened Putin is a more dangerous Putin. It's sometimes better to let the bear run out of the cage and back to the forest.""

War in Ukraine: Anti-war opinions can cost Russians their jobs,2022-03-20T00:54:00.000Z,"For 28-year-old geography teacher Kamran Manafly, it all began with an Instagram post.  ""I don't want to be a reflection of state propaganda,"" he wrote on the social media site, just a few days before it was restricted in Russia. ""I have my own opinion! Lots of teachers do. And you know what? It's not the same as the opinion of the state."" He felt compelled to write the comment after a staff meeting at his secondary school in central Moscow, in which he and his colleagues were told how to talk to their pupils about the situation in Ukraine - not to deviate from the government position.  Two hours after posting, he received a call from the school's headteacher telling him to delete it immediately, or leave his job.  ""I didn't want to delete it,"" Mr Manafly told the BBC. ""I knew straight away there was no point in arguing, so I thought it was best to just resign.""  When he arrived at school the next day, expecting to pick up his things and sign his resignation letter, he was barred from entering the premises.  ""They said they have an order not to let me in. The children started to come out on to the street to support me, say goodbye and so on. Then someone called the police and said I was organising an unsanctioned rally."" Videos seen by the BBC show the children crowding round Mr Manafly, applauding, smiling and saying goodbye.  He eventually recovered his belongings, and the next day he was able to meet the school's headteacher, where he was asked for a formal explanation about why he had expressed his political views on social media. Mr Manafly refused, expecting to resign anyway, but instead was told that the situation had changed, and he was going to be dismissed.  ""Two days later, I was informed that I had been fired for immoral behaviour at work,"" Mr Manafly said. ""For me, the strangest thing is that they consider the expression of a personal opinion to be 'immoral'."" The school's headteacher did not respond to a request for comment, but in WhatsApp messages seen by the BBC, parents at the school were informed that Mr Manafly's posts on social media had broken his working agreement with his employers, which he denies.  After Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, many thousands of Russians, particularly in Moscow and St Petersburg, expressed their opposition to the so-called ""special military operation"", signing petitions, posting on social media, or joining anti-war street protests. The state's response has been heavy-handed, detaining thousands of protesters and introducing a new law which made spreading ""fake"" information about the Russian military punishable by up to 15 years in jail.  Still, Mr Manafly's Instagram post did not fall foul of that law, according to Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which felt able to publish it in full even after the new regulations came into force.  Despite the increased risk, for Katya Dolinina, the invasion of Ukraine was the moment she could stay quiet no longer. A manager of two cinemas at the state-affiliated Moskino cinema chain, Ms Dolinina had tended to keep her political views to herself.  ""I loved my job, I enjoyed it. I didn't want to lose it,"" she told the BBC, explaining why she had not taken part in previous protests against the government.  But when the war started, that changed. When friends sent her an open letter against the so-called ""special operation"", signed by people working in the cultural sector, she didn't hesitate to add her name. ""I agreed with the opinion that these operations should be stopped immediately, that this was not ok,"" she said.  Soon after signing the letter, Ms Dolinina received a call from her boss. She should remove her name immediately, or resign. If she refused to do either, she would be fired, she was told. Moskino did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.  ""I felt like it doesn't matter any more. I don't know how I would work anyway if they didn't ask me to resign. After this special operation started I don't feel any motivation to do anything that's not connected to it,"" she said. She resigned without a fuss, she said, because she was worried that her employers would otherwise find a pretext to fire her, which would cause her more problems in the future.  LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyANALYSIS: Putin's redrawn the world - but not as he wantedBATTLEFIELD: What have been Russia's military mistakes?WATCH: Drone footage shows Mariupol devastationIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the war The whole process of ending her employment took just a couple of hours, and the atmosphere at her final meeting with her managers was cordial - they told Ms Dolinina they were sad to see her go, although she now wonders if that was just an attempt to avoid conflict.  But for Anna Levadnaya, a paediatrician and influencer with over two million followers on Instagram, the meeting in which she found out she must resign was far from friendly.  She was on holiday abroad when the invasion of Ukraine began. That day, she posted a photograph on Instagram of an aeroplane window, with an image of a peace dove attached.  ""I didn't choose aggression,"" she wrote. ""I am frightened for us all."" She described her family's Ukrainian roots, and called for ""this hell"" to end as soon as possible. With such a huge following on Instagram, the post was unlikely to go unnoticed by her employer, a major state-run medical centre in Moscow.  Several days later, Dr Levadnaya, still abroad, heard from colleagues that the director of the medical centre had lambasted her anti-war comments during the morning conference in front of more than 100 of her colleagues. She received a video recording of the event.  ""It was a public shaming,"" Dr Levadnaya told the BBC. ""They made it clear that someone who doesn't support the aims of the government should not be working at a state-run institution.""  The director gave a speech, several minutes long, explaining that if Dr Levadnaya had been better informed about world events, she would support the ""special operation"". Soon after, she was instructed to write a letter of resignation, and if she refused she would be fired.  Her letter consisted of a single sentence, explaining simply that it would be ""impossible to continue her work"".  In her social media posts, Dr Levadnaya explains current medical issues in an engaging way that makes sense to her audience. She has learned to live with internet trolls and angry comments, she said, but the invasion of Ukraine has taken it to a different level.  ""Even Covid vaccines, which created so much aggression, didn't cause as much hatred between people as this war. There's this huge split in society now, because everyone only believes their own truth."" Many who find themselves on the opposite side of that split to the Russian state have had their lives turned upside down by the war in Ukraine. Some have lost their jobs, others have resigned in protest. Family ties have become strained, often along generational lines.  For Kamran Manafly and many thousands of others, the only option was to leave the country. But not everyone can, or wants, to take that step.  ""Not every Russian who disagrees with Kremlin propaganda can leave this country"", Katya Dolinina said. ""We are still here. We still have hope. We try not to give up."""
Anonymous: How hackers are trying to undermine Putin,2022-03-20T01:00:04.000Z,"The Anonymous hacktivist collective has been bombarding Russia with cyber-attacks since declaring ""cyber war"" on President Vladimir Putin in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. Several people operating under its banner spoke to the BBC about their motives, tactics and plans.  Of all the cyber-attacks carried out since the Ukraine conflict started, an Anonymous hack on Russian TV networks stands out. The hack was captured in a short video clip which shows normal programming interrupted with images of bombs exploding in Ukraine and soldiers talking about the horrors of the conflict.  The video began circulating on the 26 February and was shared by Anonymous social media accounts with millions of followers. ""JUST IN: #Russian state TV channels have been hacked by #Anonymous to broadcast the truth about what happens in #Ukraine,"" one post read. It quickly racked up millions of views. The stunt has all the hallmarks of an Anonymous hack - dramatic, impactful and easy to share online. Like many of the group's other cyber-attacks it was also extremely hard to verify.  But one of the smaller groups of Anonymous hackers said that they were responsible, and that they took over TV services for 12 minutes.  The first person to post the video was also able to verify it was real. Eliza lives in the US but her father is Russian and called her when his TV shows were interrupted. ""My father called me when it happened and said, 'Oh my God, they're showing the truth!' So I got him to record it and I posted the clip online. He says one of his friends saw it happen too."" Rostelecom, the Russian company that runs the hacked services did not respond to requests for comment. The hackers justified their actions saying innocent Ukrainians were being massacred. ""We will intensify the attacks on the Kremlin, if nothing is done to restore peace in Ukraine,"" they added.  Anonymous says it has also taken down Russian websites and stolen government data, but Lisa Forte, a partner at cyber-security company Red Goat says most of these attacks have so far been ""quite basic"". Hackers have mostly been using DDoS attacks, where a server is overwhelmed by a flood of requests, she said. These are relatively simple to carry out and only take websites offline temporarily.  ""But the TV hack is incredibly creative,"" she said, ""and I would think quite difficult to pull off."" The hacktivist collective first emerged in 2003 from the website 4chanThe group has no leadership, its tagline is ""We are legion""Anyone can claim to be a part of the group and hack for any cause they want, but they generally they attack organisations accused of misusing powerTheir symbol is a Guy Fawkes mask, made famous by Alan Moore's graphic novel V for Vendetta in which an anarchist revolutionary topples a corrupt fascist governmentThe group has many social media accounts, with 15.5 million followers on its Twitter pages alone Anonymous hackers have also defaced Russian websites. Forte says this involves gaining control of a website to change the content displayed.  So far, the attacks have caused disruption and embarrassment, but cyber-experts have become increasingly concerned by the explosion of hacktivism since the invasion. They are worried that a hacker might accidentally knock out a hospital's computer network or interrupt critical communication links. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" says Emily Taylor from the Cyber Policy Journal. ""These attacks do carry risks. [They] could lead to escalation, or someone could accidentally cause real damage to a critical part of civilian life."" You can hear more about this story and hear from some of the hackers themselves in the '5 Minutes On' podcast available on BBC Sounds. Anonymous has not been this active in years. Roman, a Ukrainian tech entrepreneur who heads a group of hackers called Stand for Ukraine, had no links with the organisation until Russia invaded his country. But he told me that when he and his team briefly defaced the website of the Russian state news agency, Tass, with an anti-Putin poster, they included an Anonymous logo. Roman works from his apartment in Kyiv, co-ordinating his team as they create websites, Android apps and Telegram bots to help Ukraine's war effort, and hack Russian targets. ""I am ready to go and pick up a rifle for Ukraine, but at the moment my skills are better used at the computer. So I'm here in my home with my two laptops, co-ordinating this IT resistance."" He says his group took a Russian regional train ticket service offline for a number of hours, although the BBC has not been able to verify this. He defends his actions saying: ""These things are illegal and wrong until there is a threat to you or your relative."" Another group that has merged with Anonymous is a Polish hacking team called Squad 303, named after a famous Polish fighter squadron in World War Two. ""We work together with Anonymous all the time and I now consider myself a member of the Anonymous movement,"" says one of the group, who uses the name of WW2 pilot Jan Zumbach as his moniker. He didn't want his photograph published but another member of his team, a Ukrainian, sent a picture of himself in a helmet and mask. He described his situation as ""on the barricade with a rifle during the day and hacking with the Squad/Anonymous at night"". Squad 303 has built a website allowing members of the public to send text messages to random Russian phone numbers, telling them the truth about the war. They claim to have facilitated more than 20 million SMS and WhatsApp messages. Two Anonymous groups I spoke to cited this as the most impactful thing the collective has done so far for Ukraine. Asked how he justified the Squad's illegal activity, Jan Zumbach said they did not steal or share any private information and were only trying to speak to Russians, with the aim of winning the information war. However he also said they were planning a more impactful hack in the coming days. Vigilante groups in Russia are also carrying out attacks on Ukraine, but seemingly on a smaller scale. There have been three major waves of co-ordinated DDoS attacks against Ukraine since January, plus three incidents of more serious ""wiper"" attacks that deleted data on a small number of Ukrainian computer systems. Ukraine says it is fighting first 'hybrid war'Russia's vigilante hackers join the attack on UkraineCyber-attacks escalate against Ukrainian websites  On Wednesday a manipulated video of President Zelensky appeared on the Ukraine 24 TV channel website after an apparent hack. In the current environment, though, it's hard to know exactly who is behind any given cyber-attack.  ""The Achilles heel of Anonymous is that anyone can claim to be Anonymous, including state actors operating against what we're fighting for,"" says long-standing Anonymous hacker Anon2World. ""With our current rise in popularity, it's (almost) a given that there will be obvious repercussions from a government entity. As for adding to the chaos, we're used to chaos, especially online."""
War in Ukraine: America is learning the art of humility,2022-03-18T23:06:10.000Z," America is learning the art of humility. That's a good thing for the rest of the world.  The country that began this century by invading not one but two countries, has become more modest in the face of the nightmare that is Ukraine. Forget shock and awe, this is the era of caution and apprehension. That's what having no good options will do for you.  Friday's two-hour phone call with China's President Xi, superpower to superpower, was a sign of how hard it will be for America to stop this war. The US's leverage over China is limited, and readouts from both sides suggest the call didn't achieve much. But it was part of an orchestrated diplomatic strategy that contrasts with much of the first year of Joe Biden's presidency.  After the fiasco of the Afghan withdrawal last summer, America lost credibility with its European allies. US intelligence looked unprepared, and the operation of leaving was staggeringly incompetent. What's more, European diplomats complained, America didn't really consult with allies. America pulled out on its own precipitous timetable, leaving countries that still had forces and personnel in the country scrambling. When some Europeans said it would be smart to leave a residual Nato force, the White House ignored the pleas. That heavy-handed mission was followed by another. In September, the White House announced a nuclear submarine security pact between Australia, Britain and the US. The pact left the French, who had been negotiating their own sub sale to the Australians, out in the cold. Worse, the Elysee Palace said it learned of the new deal from the press. It was a masterclass in how not to handle your oldest ally. The French were so furious that President Biden apologised and admitted the US had been clumsy. But the damage was done.  By the autumn of 2021 Europeans were disappointed in the Biden administration and felt their hopes that a post-Trump America would be more collegial were ill-founded. When Washington started ringing the alarm bell about Russia and Ukraine, Europeans weren't in much mood to listen. ""War-mongering"" was how one EU diplomat described it to me. Whether it was the lesson of Afghanistan or the nature of this particularly difficult catastrophe, we don't know, but the White House handled this crisis very differently.  From the start it has consulted with its allies, many of whom were sceptical. There are reports that US diplomats approached Europeans as equals not subordinates. The administration shared highly secret intelligence in a manner that was unprecedented. In the months that led up to the invasion senior White House officials made multiple trips to meet their European counterparts. President Biden made regular phone calls to European leaders.  This wasn't Iraq in 2002, it wasn't Trump's America First, it wasn't Afghanistan in 2021. This was genuine alliance building. On 27 January there was an indication that the shuttle diplomacy was bearing fruit. A full month before the invasion, during an otherwise ordinary press briefing, the White House spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, announced that German Chancellor Olaf Sholz would visit the White House on 7 February.   Securing that visit of the brand new German leader was an indication that the administration both anticipated what was coming, and knew what was needed: German co-operation. A visit to the White House is a coup for any foreign leader, it's a useful weapon of soft power. Yes, President Zelensky's articulate appeals also played a big part in shifting German policy, but US diplomacy helped win German support.  Ukraine war: Zelensky invokes 9/11 in plea to US CongressWhy Biden won't send US troops to UkraineBiden defends 'messy' US pull-out from Afghanistan Beyond diplomacy, there is a new recognition here of Washington's military limits, a realisation that force won't get America everything it wants, however strong its army. That's an unusual position for the world's biggest military. When Saddam Hussein marched into Kuwait in 1990, the US rallied the world to put boots on the ground to get him out. In 1999 President Clinton ordered Nato jets to conduct airstrikes in Kosovo. After 9/11, the US strong-armed a coalition of the unwilling to invade Iraq. In 2011, the US military was part of the operation that helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. Today Washington is holding back, resisting the emotional pleas of Zelensky to use that military clout. It's sending weapons, intelligence and cyber-support. But for the moment it won't do more.  America knows it could impose, and most probably enforce, a no-fly zone. It has the jets and missiles and pilots to do so. But, as the White House says repeatedly, mobilising the might of the Pentagon won't necessarily end this war, it might make it worse. The more America leads, the greater the risk that Putin can sell this to his own people as a fight between Russia and the US.  Which is why you won't hear this White House talk about regime change, or democracy, or even freedom in Russia. I reread President Bush's second inaugural address, delivered in 2005, at the height of the Iraq war, when neo-conservatives ran US foreign policy.   ""It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nature and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world,"" the newly re-elected president declared. Talk about hubris.  Yet the White House also understands the risks of not being more assertive. It knows that not intervening could lead to the deaths of countless more Ukrainian civilians, and President Putin may strike a Nato country anyway. So it walks a tightrope with potentially horrifying consequences, recognising that there are no good answers. The US is left to help Ukrainians from the sidelines. And maybe that is all they can do.  It is enough to make anyone more humble."
Street fighting in Mariupol and hypersonic missiles: Ukraine war daily round-up,2022-03-19T20:20:33.000Z," Russia's invasion of Ukraine is in is fourth week, but the city of Mariupol remains under Ukrainian control, despite near-constant bombardment from the Russian forces which surround the city.  On Saturday, the city's mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that street fighting in the city centre is hampering efforts to rescue hundreds of people trapped in the basement of a bombed theatre. ""There are tanks... and artillery shelling, and all kinds of weapons fired in the area,"" the mayor said. The humanitarian situation in the city is critical. It has no electricity, gas or water, and supplies of food and medicine are running out.  Elsewhere in Ukraine, a Russian attack on a military barracks near the southern city of Mykolaiv is reported to have killed scores of Ukrainian soldiers. A source told the BBC that around 200 soldiers were sleeping there when three missiles hit the base.  In western Ukraine, Russia said it launched a hypersonic ballistic missile to destroy a large underground arms depot.  Russian President Vladimir Putin boasts that Russia leads the world in hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound. They can also change direction mid-flight, making them harder to track.  But analysts told the BBC that the use of a hypersonic missile is not a game-changer, and should be seen in the context of showmanship, or even a sign that Russia's supplies of other missiles are running out.  The politics of Ukraine's war have made it to space.   Three Russian cosmonauts arrived at the International Space Station wearing blue and yellow space suits - the colours of the Ukrainian flag.  But soon after, Russia's space agency denied it had anything to do with Ukraine, saying ""sometimes yellow is just yellow"", and explaining that blue and yellow were the colours of the university where the three men studied. In a live-streamed news conference from the space station, one of the cosmonauts explained that they had accumulated lot of yellow material, so they chose to use it for their space suits.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed the world, writes the BBC's Alan Little in a historical take on this pivotal moment in history.  ""It is a rare thing,"" he writes, ""to live through a moment of huge historical consequence and understand in real time that is what it is."" He finds similarities with the war in the former Yugoslavia, where Serb forces, despite their superior firepower, were unable to overpower the Bosnian defenders of Sarajevo, and so instead laid siege to it.  ""Is that what the Russians intend for Mariupol, for Kharkiv, for Kyiv? To starve them into submission?"" Little writes.  In the UK, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said another plane has been grounded as authorities investigate its ""possible Russian links"". British sanctions against Russia mean all planes owned, operated or chartered by Russians are banned from flying or landing in the UK. UK exports of aviation or space-related technology to Russia have also been banned.

Oscars: How Encanto composer Germaine Franco is smashing the glass ceiling,2022-03-20T00:02:30.000Z,"""The love of music brings me hereâ¦ a Latina from El Paso, Texas, a drummer girl, composer, songwriter, lover of tunes and anything that makes noise."" That's how Hollywood composer Germaine Franco responded to the news that she had been nominated for an Oscar for best original score for Disney's latest hit animation, Encanto. While the ubiquitous Lin-Manuel Miranda is responsible for every parent's favourite earworm We Don't Talk About Bruno and the film's numerous other catchy songs, it's Franco who is behind the magical score, which seamlessly blends with Miranda's work. She is the first woman to score a Disney animated film, the first Latina to join the music branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the first to receive an Oscar nomination for best original score. If she triumphs at Sunday's ceremony, she will be just the fifth female winner in 87 years. Set in Colombia, Encanto is based around a family with fading magical powers who are battling to save their home. Franco has been thrilled with the film's reception and the soundtrack's chart-storming performance. ""The soundtrack is still sailing up there. The success is exciting, gratifying and so exhilarating. We've been going through this pandemic for so long... and to know that kids are enjoying it, and parents are enjoying watching their kids, that is really the best result we could hope for."" Franco's extensive back catalogue includes work on Coco, The Lorax and How to Train Your Dragon 2.  But it's Encanto and its Oscar buzz - the movie also has nominations for best original song (Miranda's Dos Oruguitas) and best animated feature - that has propelled her into the spotlight. Miranda specifically asked for Franco to get on board, having heard her work on Coco. ""Every project is different. On this one, Lin had written most of the songs before I came on,"" she explains.  ""My job is to make sure the score works with the existing songs and can weave in and out. And I was adding the orchestra to the songs. So the end of my score will always lead you to the very beginning of his song, harmonically. And that's why you don't really feel that there's a difference."" Franco wanted to bring an authentic Colombian sound - but that was a challenge given that she couldn't travel there due to the pandemic. ""I did my best to bring Colombia to me and imagine what it was like, and also I did a lot of research, listening to many, many hours of Colombian music from all genres and periods,"" she says. ""Classical, indigenous, Afro Colombian... I also decided I must use the Colombian instruments."" They included a Colombian harp, a flute called a gaita, a marimba and some hand drums called tamboras.  ""I just thought, this has to be rich. Women's voices are a big part of Colombian music. And so I actually had a 12-piece choir on the track Antonio's Voice. ""Those instruments tell a story about culture from thousands of years ago."" The score still has that familiar Disney feel, with its crashing crescendos, soaring strings and gentle playfulness. ""I've listened to Disney for so long, so I just I wanted to honour the sound of the classic Disney soundtrack while doing something different at the same time,"" Franco explains. Her own musical journey began as a child in Texas. ""I was just always that drummer girl, banging on stuff, as my mom would say. ""Nobody actually asked me to practice. I just would take the drums and sit at the piano. And I would just play for hours."" Later, she studied music and ""really started learning about orchestras"". Franco began composing while at college, later writing for theatre before moving into film and TV. According to the latest annual Celluloid Ceiling report published by Women in TV and Film, just 7% of the top 250 highest-grossing films featured a score written by a woman. That's a small increase on the 5% figure in 2020, while the previous two years both came in at 6%. So it's slow progress. Laura Karpman, who is currently writing The Marvels score, set up the the Alliance for Women Film Composers in 2014. She says: ""I think most sexism is deeply insidious. It creeps up on you. I noticed early on that my male colleagues were having much greater success than I was in traditionally large scale and big budget projects. ""At first I thought it was something that I had done, but I started to realise it was not me but merely the fact that I was not seen as somebody who could handle the larger projects, no matter how many times I clearly proved that I could."" But she adds: ""Things are opening up. I am so delighted and in fact shocked that the advocacy work that we have all done is working. You see what happens when women are given the opportunities. They get Oscar nominations."" Rebecca Grierson, managing director at agency SixtyFour Talent, is the composer advocate for Free the Work, a talent initiative that aims to boost opportunities for under-represented groups. She says: ""There is implicit and unconscious bias when hiring people of colour. Couple this with sexism and it's a steep hill to climb.  ""Film-makers can help by considering more diverse composer reels and not always hiring the 'safe' option for a composer. Taking risks on new or up-and-coming composers is necessary to level the playing field."" Fellow composer Dara Taylor also points out that award recognition is important. ""I believe that the common goal is for nominations such as these [Franco's] to become increasingly less historic and more commonplace,"" she says. Franco says she is glad to be paving the way for others while also focusing on creating her best work. ""I feel happy to be in this place, to have other women and people of colour and just people who are different from the default composer to see they can can do it as well.  ""I've gotten many, many letters and emails from women all over the world who are so happy this is happening. It's a positive moment. It inspires others to keep creating."" She notes that it's also important for people of colour to be offered more opportunities to work on all kinds of projects, not just ones related to their heritage. ""It depends on perception about your last name and what you look like - [the assumption] that you can only write certain types of music.  ""I worked on Tag, which is a bro comedy, and Little, which is a black story of female power. I feel like now people are starting to remove the filter, but it is a concern that some composers of colour have felt that they don't get called for a certain type of film."" Franco says she tries to ""just get to work"" and ""not think about the barriers"". We need to talk about why Bruno won't win an OscarLin Manuel Miranda on Encanto success But she acknowledges that ""the barriers exist... they're changing but they're still there"". ""I've had people come into my studio and say: 'Oh, did you study music?' The person that I was supposed to collaborate with asking me if I have a music degree!  ""I've even had a journalist ask me if I've ever studied music and it's just, you know, jaw drop! There are those instances when you walk in and you're the only woman and people think you don't know the difference between, say, the type of recording resolutions."" She's philosophical about the state of play. ""Some people have their preconceived ideas... but I try not to focus on that too much because I want to focus on the positive. As artists, we just have to keep going.  ""The answer is to keep putting out that body of work and then pretty soon people will see it."" And on her Oscar potential? ""I feel everything about this film has been a really great experience, anything else that happens... I'm considering it with gratitude."""
"Newspaper headlines: Anger at PM's comparison, and Putin's hypersonic missile",2022-03-20T05:46:38.000Z,"Both the Sunday Times and the Observer front pages examine the reaction to the prime minister likening the Ukrainians' struggle to Brexit. The Observer says it has ""enraged"" political leaders across Europe.  The former president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, is said to have recalled Vladimir Putin's enthusiasm after the 2016 referendum.  The Sunday Times quotes the former Belgian prime minister and European Council Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, calling the comparison ""insane"". Meanwhile the Daily Star Sunday describes a new hypersonic weapon - which Russia says it has used in Ukraine - as ""crazy Putin's new terror missile"".  The Sunday Express accuses the Russian leader of ""upping the ante"". A weapons expert warns the Sunday People that Russia was retaliating against moves by Britain and its allies to arm Ukraine. Many of the papers look ahead to the chancellor's spring statement on Wednesday.  The Mail on Sunday says Rishi Sunak has given the ""strongest hint yet"" that he could cut fuel duty and income tax. In an interview with the Mail, Mr Sunak says his ""priority over the rest of this Parliament is to cut people's taxes"".  The Sun on Sunday says Treasury sources are indicating that tax thresholds may be lifted. And the Sunday Times suggests Mr Sunak is preparing a ""giveaway"" to convince voters that he is ""on their side"".  The Observer predicts an increase in the Â£150 rebate on council tax bills for lower value homes in England.  The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, tells the paper she supports such moves, while calling for benefits to rise by 6%.  In his interview with the Mail, Mr Sunak also speaks of his enthusiasm for lifting the ban on fracking.  However, the Sunday Telegraph suggests Mr Sunak has frustrated Mr Johnson by not backing his push to increase the number of nuclear reactors in the UK. The Mail reports that senior royals are thinking about opening their homes to Ukrainian refugees.  A source tells the paper that Prince Charles is looking at finding spaces on his Dumfries House estate in Ayrshire, and at holiday homes in the Duchy of Cornwall, while the Queen is considering if they could be accommodated on her Balmoral Estate.  According to the Sunday Telegraph, the growing trend among supermarkets and restaurants to produce variations on the traditional hot cross bun has been condemned as ""the devil's work"" by the Queen's former honorary chaplain.  Gavin Ashenden has said retailers are ""enlarging appetites"" by adding unhealthy fillings to the buns - thereby warping their symbolism.   The paper says one bakery chain has previously sold a ""hot cross bun bacon butty"", while KFC launched a hot cross bun burger with chicken and cheese. And there is speculation speculation in the Sunday People that Hugh Grant could become the next Doctor Who, replacing Jodie Whittaker.  The Sunday Mirror suggests secret talks are taking place with the actor in an attempt to increase ratings.  An insider tells the Mirror, ""the vision is it can become a Marvel-like product"" with franchises around the Doctor.

From the cafe waitress to its teenage owner,2022-03-19T19:26:45.000Z,"Chloe Campbell was 15 when she started waitressing in a cafe in Moray, and now four years later she owns it. Chloe said she had always been good at saving her money, so when the opportunity arose to go from employee to employer at The Coffee Pot in Dufftown she jumped at the chance. She had held onto most of her wages, aside from spending on basics, and the 19-year-old got the keys last month. She said she hoped to one day expand the business. ""I was working somewhere else and saw this job, it was just weekends I started off doing, and progressed from there,"" Chloe recalled of starting at The Coffee Pot. ""Then last September I was speaking to the owner about having my own cafÃ© and she said 'you could have this place?' ""So I took the offer. When I got the opportunity I just knew that I had to go for it and see what happens. I just knew I couldn't say no."" She had saved enough to take it over, and the lease is paid monthly. ""I have always been a good saver. I spent what I needed, like on car insurance,"" Chloe told BBC Scotland as she took some freshly-baked scones out the cafÃ© oven. ""My mum, a childminder, and dad, a farmer, both have businesses and they have always taught me from a young age that money doesn't grow on trees. So you've got to save it, and work for what you want, and that's what I've done."" Chloe said the hardest part was proving to be getting her head around all the paperwork. ""My mum and dad are very good and advise me on how I should be doing things. Hopefully when I'm on my feet a bit more I'll be changing a few things."" She said she has six very good employees of various ages. The cafÃ© sells breakfasts and lunches as well as coffee and sweet treats. ""We have a lot of regulars,"" she said. ""Everything is made here. Our cakes are very popular - especially the strawberry tarts."" As for expansion, she said: ""If the opportunity occurs then I definitely would."" Asked what it is like to be the new owner, she added: ""I don't think I'm too bossy."""
Ukraine: Brit finds refugee to host after Polish trip,2022-03-19T17:46:17.000Z,"A British man who flew to Poland to find a Ukrainian refugee whom he could host is ""waiting for the green light"" to bring him to the UK. Max Fox, from Lancashire, said he wanted to find somebody with whom he would be happy to share his home. He has sent an application after meeting a Ukrainian man called Vlad. ""In the meantime I'm going to keep him in a hotelâ¦ as the government have given no timelines of how long [the outcome] will take,"" Mr Fox said. The UK government's Homes for Ukraine scheme allows British residents to name a Ukrainian to either stay with them or in a separate propertyOn Friday, online applications were launched for Ukrainians who have a named British sponsorPeople offering accommodation will be vetted while refugees will undergo security checksHowever, many Brits who have signed up to the scheme have expressed concerns about how it will work in practice Mr Fox, 32, who lives with his husband in Poulton-le-Fylde, arrived in Poland on Thursday, where he also distributed food to refugees escaping the Russian invasion. He said he wanted to host a refugee with whom he could ""gel"", adding ""I want to bring somebody into my home who I will have a good relationship with"". Mr Fox, an artistic director for a group of hotels in Blackpool, first came into contact with Vlad, aged 26, online and met him in the Polish city of Krakow on Friday. ""He was in Poland when the [Ukraine] government enforced the conscription,"" Mr Fox said, referring to the policy that most men aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the war torn country as they must join the resistance. ""So he hasn't been able to go back and see his parents who live in the west [of Ukraine]. They are too afraid to leave."" He said he was glad to be able to meet Vlad before travelling to the UK. ""It's been exciting but nerve-racking at the same time,"" he added. Mr Fox said he and Vlad hoped to set up a website to link Ukrainian refugees with British residents to help others in a similar situation.

Why are water bills rising more in some areas?,2022-03-20T00:30:54.000Z,"The cost of living crisis has seen fuel and energy bills rise sharply - but water customers in some parts of the country have also noticed an increase in their bills. BBC News asks what lies behind it.  Of the 11 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales, customers of Northumbrian Water (10.8%) and Severn Trent (7.1%) have seen the highest average bill rises.  Customers of some other companies have actually seen average bills fall. Customers have expressed anger. Steve Willey, from Sherwood, Nottingham, is served by Severn Trent Water, which is seeing the second highest average rise in the country. He said the increase was ""not fair"". ""The cost of living keeps going up all the time at the moment. It seems bills are going up and National Insurance keeps going up,"" he said. ""People are going to struggle to heat their homes at the moment. I'm very annoyed about it - very angry."" MPs have also criticised the rises, with Ashfield's Lee Anderson saying: ""I understand the argument they have extra costs, but a 7% increase when, in other areas of the country it's about 3-4% - they really need to look at it again."" Inflation is the main reason, according to regulator Ofwat. All water companies are able to increase bills in line with inflation. As a result, some bills are going up significantly due to rising inflation rates. However, some water companies have also been allowed to charge their customers more. The companies operate in five-year business cycles, with the latest running until 2025, where Ofwat approves the services they will deliver and the amount they will charge for them. A review by the Competition and Marketing Authority (CMA) approved some of the investment Ofwat had initially ruled out. This has meant four companies - Anglian, Bristol, Northumbrian and Yorkshire - saw changes to their price controls. Customers currently do not pick up the costs of fines imposed on water companies due to failures to meet standards, according to the Consumer Council for Water (CCW). This means when companies such as Severn Trent are fined Â£1.5m for sewage discharge, that eats into their profits, rather than being added on to bills. However, customers do ultimately fund the costs of improving standards - and the challenges faced in different regions play a part in the discrepancy in bills. Environment Secretary George Eustice said concerns about water companies discharging raw sewage into rivers were likely to feed into the next negotiation in 2025 - and customers will end up paying. He told the BBC: ""The truth is that you can't make the sort of investments that we need to improve sewage infrastructure, without some payment somewhere. ""It's why we're taking a decision not to eliminate all storm overflows overnight because the cost of that could be several hundred billion pounds and that would be a very, very sharp increase in water bills. ""But we're taking the pragmatic approach which is reducing the most harmful storm overflows, and there will be a cost associated with that. ""Everything in the end has to be paid for in some way. ""And if you're going to have that target to reduce sewage overflows into the water, there's a cost of putting in place that kind of infrastructure."" While Northumbrian Water and Severn Trent have seen the highest rises for 2022/23, their average bills - at Â£365 and Â£389 respectively - remain lower than those in other parts of the country. Average bills in Cornwall, Devon and parts of Somerset and Dorset - served by South West Water - were Â£472. Customers in that region get a government reduction, due to the region's long coastline and the amount of bathing water that requires maintenance. Users of Wessex Water - which also supplies water to Somerset and Dorset, as well as Bristol and Wiltshire, saw average bills stand at Â£470. Experts say the wide variation in bills comes down to factors such as how spread out the population is - dense, urban areas tend to cost less to supply - and how much coastline the region has. South West Water said: ""Providing our services across a large geographic area which includes about a third of the country's bathing waters means we need more treatment works and thousands of miles of pipes."" A Wessex Water spokesperson said: ""Bills in the region are slightly higher than other parts of the country because there are more pipes per customer to maintain and the cost of moving water across our region is expensive."" While the water industry said it has support for anybody struggling to pay their bills, consumers fear this also lacks standardisation. The CCW, a consumer body, said there were big regional variations in the percentage of households receiving support. It said the problem is particularly acute in regions like the North West, where 12% of households need support but only about 3% of households were currently receiving such help. In Severn Trent's region, it said only about 21% of those facing water poverty were lifted out of it by current support schemes. Schemes differ across the country, depending on the arrangements the companies have with their customers - whose bills fund such support. The CCW's senior policy manager Andrew White said: ""It's a big concern for us and we have set out a number of different recommendations to replace the current postcode lottery of support. ""Water is often one of the first bills to go unpaid, because you can't be disconnected from your supply. But there are also many families suffering in silence, who pay their water bill but make sacrifices on other bills, such as food."" Christine McGourty, CEO of Water UK, the trade association representing water companies, said: ""I would urge anyone who's concerned to get in touch with their water company."" Both Severn Trent and Northumbrian Water said that while they have seen the highest rises, the amount they charge was still lower than average bills in other parts of the country. Northumbrian Water said: ""Our bills remain the lowest combined water and sewerage charges in England and continue to be less than what our customers paid for their water charges in 2019/2020."" They said they were working on a number of projects in the North East to improve the company's environmental performance, such as a Â£30m spend on sewer improvements in County Durham and an investigation into bathing quality water at Marsden Beach, in South Tyneside. They said they were also spending Â£145m on the supply network across County Durham and Teesside, replacing sections that were more than 100 years old. Northumbrian Water's chief executive Heidi Mottram said: ""These essential investments, together with the rising costs of inflation has meant it is necessary for us to increase our prices by a small amount."" A Severn Trent spokesperson said: ""The recent change to customer bills is linked to inflation, reflecting the cost of living increase we're experiencing right across our supply chain. ""This also factors in the levels of investment we're making in our infrastructure and the environment."" Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham East, has called for private companies to be brought back into public ownership. ""Water has a monopoly which means people don't have any choice about who their water provider is. Companies like Severn Trent can charge what they want and privatisation is actually costing us more money,"" she said. But so far, the government has proved lukewarm about such suggestions. Rising bills, it said, were in line with the revenue controls set by Ofwat. Regarding water poverty, the CCW is hopeful it will get government backing for a single water bill assistance scheme, which would standardise support. But this may not happen until 2025 - and campaigners argue many customers need help now. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to eastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk."
How modern slavery victim went from homelessness to 'amazing' job,2022-03-20T00:36:33.000Z,"Will spent years being homeless and further time as a victim of modern slavery. But since teaming up with a Birmingham charity, he has a job and a safe place to live. The now 38-year-old came to Birmingham from Poland 17 years ago. He wanted to make use of his good English and move to a country which he felt had better opportunities than his home.  After getting a job with a building firm he found a place to live.  But, after a few months, a family bereavement - his sister was killed in an accident - combined with a housemate who he said did not pay his share of the bills led to him becoming depressed and evicted.  He became homeless, spending nights at the coach station in Digbeth and days in the library. Eventually, he was introduced to Sifa Fireside, a charity which runs support services for homeless people and others who want to rebuild their lives. He began to sell the Big Issue and, thanks to moving onto other jobs and the charity's support, remained off the streets for seven years. He later got employment in a warehouse where he was eventually made team leader. However, he said he had lost the job when two people he considered friends, and who he had got jobs at the factory, began stealing from it. He could not prove he was not involved. ""As a thank you for getting my friends a job, I lost mine,"" he said. Later, after nursing what he described as a mild case of depression, he found work in a factory in Walsall and moved in with a couple he met there. That is when his situation took a turn for the worse. ""They asked me if I could lend them some money because of housing benefit issues or something, I had no issue with that. They offered me a lovely meal as a thank you. And that's the end of that positive story.  ""They poisoned me, then took all my money off me, took my ID off me and then basically kept me in forced labour for close to two years."" The poison made him sick to his stomach, he said, for the next week and left him unable to leave his room. When he did, his passport, wallet, bank cards and money had gone and he ended up depending on them for everything. His food was rationed, he could not leave his room apart from to go shopping for them or translate anything and clean for them. He was stopped from working. ""Not exactly pleasant people,"" he said. ""I tried escaping a couple of times, I lost a couple of teeth because of that. I was walking from Bloxwich towards Walsall, a car pulled up and I was knocked to the floor and ended up back at home sweet home."" He felt he could not get help as he did not have any address or paperwork to prove who he was. The only thing he was allowed to keep was his library card, as it was not considered of value. ""Best thing I could do was borrow a few books from the library so at least I had something to read, one thing I could do for myself. I would read books all day while staying in bed because if I made a noise they got annoyed."" He got a food allowance of two loaves of bread, two packs of soft cheese and a pack of luncheon meat to last him a week. ""If I got lucky and found some pennies on the floor I would buy some cookies."" Sometimes the couple would go with him to the shops, sometimes not, but even if not he said they had so many friends around the town centre there were no opportunities to leave. The couple were alcoholics, he said, which eventually helped him escape.  ""They were horribly drunk one night to the point where I took advantage of it and escaped at three o'clock in the morning and literally walked from Walsall to Birmingham straight to Sifa Fireside. ""It was the best walk ever."" As well as providing a drop-in centre where people can get hot food, a shower and access to a range of supporting services, Sifa staff also work to get their clients into employment. Sifa is launching a scheme for corporate partners to get involved. The Building Employability project involves: Identifying employment and training opportunities within an organisationTraining staff to recognise signs of hidden homelessnessHelping fund projects and organisations. Will went back to selling the Big Issue and working as a volunteer at Sifa. Other than raising various benefits issues with Sifa and Job Centre staff, he said he had not asked Sifa take any steps on his behalf. ""I had washed my hands of the entire matter,"" he said. He was living in a tent in Aston when, through Sifa, came the opportunity to apply for a job at Birmingham's Urban Emporiums. He borrowed a suit from the charity's clothing cupboard to attend the interview. ""It was very funny when I stumbled out of my tent in my three-piece suit and shiny shoes,"" he said. He was given a 15-hour-a-week job as a pot washer. Five years later he is kitchen manager at the firm's Jewellery Quarter site. ""He was the most smartly dressed applicant we had,"" said Hannah Wolsey, managing director of Urban Emporium,  ""I think most homeless people must have an incredible amount of resilience but it is about being ready and willing to do it [apply for a job]."" Urban has always seen itself as community based, taking part in various schemes to raise money for charity. But, wanting to make more of an impact and also starting to notice a rise in homelessness in the city centre since it opened in 2009, it contacted Sifa to see what more it could do. 'Having an address got me work when I had no home'Over half of homeless families in workOffice block gives new lease of life for homeless Straight away Urban realised its own staff loved the scheme, Ms Wolsey said, adding it had been great to give people opportunities - even if all it could offer was a three-month position. ""It gets people back into that reality of life and communicating with people outside of their own homeless networks. Any industry could do it,"" Ms Wolsey said. She admits the scheme will not work for everyone and Urban has had a couple of people through the doors for whom it did not work out. But for Will, going to Urban was an ""honestly amazing experience"". He did not have a bank account, so at first the company put his wages towards his accommodation. ""The amount of compassion they show to the staff, the pressure they put on themselves to talk to the staff and interact with them, to give them chances, opportunities, training. It was something completely different for me. ""Nobody can experience several years of homelessness without some kind of mental repercussions or some degree of mental scarring which will need to be addressed,"" he said. ""That's why these schemes are so essential. They address the monetary issues, such as the homelessness, and the wider issues."" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Covid boosters: Who is being vaccinated?,2022-03-24T08:06:35.000Z,"Older and vulnerable people in England can now book an extra booster jab against Covid. Spring boosters are also being rolled out in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Across the UK, a second booster is being offered to: adults aged 75 and over residents in care homes for older adultsthose aged 12 and over with weakened immune systems You can book an appointment online three months (91 days) after your previous dose. However, to get maximum protection, the NHS recommends having the Spring dose around six months later.  An autumn booster programme, aimed at a wider group of people, is also planned. The UK's last remaining Covid restrictionsHow many cases are there in my area?Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? You should wait four weeks from the date of a positive test before having your jab, even if you have no symptoms. Under-18s who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test.  You shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever. However, patient information from Pfizer and Moderna says you don't need to delay for a mild fever or a cold. The vaccines don't infect you with Covid, and can't cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test. All five to 11-year-olds in the UK can have a low-dose Covid vaccine. It will be offered on a ""non-urgent"" basis in England from April. Children have already started to get the dose in Scotland, and plans are also underway in Wales and Northern Ireland. Children whose parents decide to take up the offer will be given two 10 microgram doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, at least 12 weeks apart. In addition: the low-dose vaccine is already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditions that put them at greater risk from Covidall children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of Pfizer16- and 17-year-olds can have a booster, three months after their second jabthe government's vaccine advisors have also recommended that a booster be offered to 12 to 15-year-olds who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed You can book jabs online, or go to a walk-in clinic.  You need to leave eight weeks between your first and second doses, and wait a further 12 weeks before a booster.  In England: Over-12s can book first or second doses, and over-16s can book a third or booster dose online, by calling 119, or visiting a walk-in clinicIn Scotland: Over-16s can register for their first dose or book their second or booster dose online, or by calling 0800 030 8013In Wales: Over-16s will be invited for their booster by their health board. If you've not been invited - or you've not had your first two doses - you can contact your health boardIn Northern Ireland: Over-12s can book online or call 0300 200 7813 Care workers in England no longer have to be vaccinated against Covid.  The government has scrapped plans to make the Covid jab mandatory for NHS staff in England.  First and second doses are either AstraZeneca or (for under-40s) Pfizer or Moderna.  Boosters are a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before. However if you cannot have Pfizer or Moderna for medical reasons, you can have a booster dose of AstraZeneca. Two other vaccines have also been approved for use in the UK - Janssen and Novavax, but these haven't been given to UK patients. The most common side effects include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea. They are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two. There are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.  A very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine. You should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated.

Cobhams Asuquo: The Nigerian singer who hated his own voice,2022-03-20T00:44:01.000Z,"Cobhams Asuquo is now one of Nigeria's leading music figures both for his production and singing, but he started his career behind the scenes because he didn't like the sound of his own voice. Asuquo's tone is serious and measured when explaining his dislike of his own voice, almost as though he is describing someone else. That discomfort with the very thing he now showcases to his fans around the world was the major reason why he spent the first 13 years of his music career as a producer to some of Africa's biggest stars, he told the BBC. Asuquo, 41, has worked with a string of Afro music stars, including Asa, on her hit 2007 album of the same name. As for his own music, which is a mix of soul, gospel, RnB and Afropop, his hit tracks include singles like We Plenti, One Hit and Ordinary People.  He is eloquent and lucid when talking about his love for music, but on the topic of his unease with his voice, he loses some of his fluency and cannot fully explain it. He even goes so far as to use the word ""hated"", and then drifts off. ""There was something about it that just didn't sit well with me,"" he says thoughtfully. It is a sentiment that is backed up by his best friend. ""He has always said that,"" Muyiwa Oyinlola concurred, but he added that Asuquo has always had an uncanny ability to imitate other people's voices.  Back in their school days at Lagos' prestigious King's College, Mr Oyinlola remembers that Asuquo, who is blind, had a radio recorder to help him in classes. He used to record the teachers on it, but not always for educational purposes.  ""He would just have a mess around and imitate all the teachers and all the housemasters,"" Mr Oyinlola remembers fondly, describing Asuquo as the ""life of the party"". It is that gregarious part of his personality that Asuquo wants to show his fans more of as he gears up to release a new album later this year, and marks 20 years in the industry.  Most of his tracks to-date are on the soulful side, as opposed to club bangers.  The new record, which will feature Afrobeats stars like Ladipoe and Bella Shmurda, will be accompanied by more performances, which he describes as ""a lot more high-energy"" and full of dancing.  He says that he eventually got into singing when he realised there were things he could do with his voice that other people couldn't. But going on stage is not something Asuquo finds easy. ""I get stage fright all the time. I've never gone on stage without being nervous. Never,"" he says, with a note of humour in his tone. He even jokingly says that as he steels himself to face the crowds, he sometimes swears to himself he will never go through the torture of another performance again.  He sounds animated when explaining what he does to temper the jitters, including jumping on one spot and prayer.  Upon the mention of prayer and faith, Asuquo becomes cerebral and real passion comes out. He describes an almost trance-like state when he actually starts the performance: ""It's hard to get me off the stage sometimes,"" he says. ""I'm in my zone."" Asuquo, who describes himself as a deeply spiritual person, says conversations with God played a pivotal role in his decision to dedicate his life's work to music, after trying out law. Despite his current fame, Asuquo has not always had such a warm reception in the Nigerian music industry. Blind from birth, early in his career he faced discrimination. He recalls an incident when one artist did not want him to produce his music. ""It was an A-list artist who is still very relevant today in the Nigerian music space, and we had a session booked and he was supposed to come in with the rest of his band."" The artist never showed. ""I was in the studio and I waited for eight hours."" Asuquo later learnt that the musician in question was uncomfortable working with a blind producer on his band's next single. But these kinds of incidents are not ones Asuquo likes to dwell on.  ""I more or less felt like [it was] his loss.  ""I pretty much just moved on and that's my general disposition."" Prior to entering the world of music full time, Asuquo also faced closed doors in his attempt to study at an American university. He had a scholarship and everything was set up, his friend recalls. ""Last minute, I think it was withdrawn."" The university worried ""a blind person from a developing country"" would not be able to cope. Although it was a tough period for Asuquo, as per his disposition, he brushed it off and moved on, Mr Oyinlola says. Asuquo credits his positive attitude to his upbringing. ""I am who I am because of the kind of love I was shown by my family."" Even though at times they did not know how to navigate the ""unfamiliar terrains of raising a blind child, I feel like they did all they knew to do at the time"", he says. Faced with the challenge of not being able to attend school until the age of 10, Asuquo said his family made an intentional effort to treat him like any other child, and created a sense of ""normalcy"". His parents taught him that being blind was just another descriptive adjective - like being ""fair-complexioned or dark"", or tall or ""not so tall"".  Asuquo learnt to play the piano by ear on a little toy instrument at a young age. A friend gave him his sister's toy piano, but warned Asuquo to never play it outside because his sister hadn't wanted to give the instrument away, despite not playing it herself. His fond memories of childhood drive him in his work as Nigeria's first national Unicef ambassador in 15 years. Any issues regarding children's rights or disabled children's rights are symptomatic of the country's leadership problem, Asuquo says, bemoaning the dearth of ""honest, responsible"" leaders in the country.  He thinks that his background can help him in his quest to improve the lot of Nigeria's children, saying music can be ""a very important tool for social change, for social justice, [and] for social re-engineering"".

A specialty coffee wave is brewing in India,2022-03-20T00:46:49.000Z,"A disappointing shopping trip paved the way for a boom in India's specialty coffee market. Matt Chitharanjan and Namrata Asthana had just moved from the southern Indian city of Chennai to national capital Delhi in 2012, and they were desperate for a good cup of coffee. In Chennai, they loved the piping hot ""filter coffee"" - a strong, frothy southern Indian brew served with milk. And before he came to India, Mr Chitharanjan drank freshly roasted, aromatic coffee from a high-end chain near his home in San Francisco.  But the coffee they found at their local Delhi supermarket had been roasted months ago and seemed stale. They saw an opportunity - earlier that year, long queues had stretched outside India's first Starbucks outlet in Mumbai city.  But the couple discovered that some of the country's best coffee was being exported. ""We started cold-calling coffee estates and setting up appointments. We had to convince them to sell us their export-quality coffee beans,"" Mr Chitharanjan says.   And soon, in early 2013, Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters was born - Mr Chitharanjan roasted the beans and Ms Asthana packaged it for sale online. Today, the hip coffee brand is a popular choice for India's urban millennials, with 50 outlets in some of India's priciest locations and thousands of customers across the country. They've roasted more than 1,000 tons of coffee and served close to three million cups so far. Now, they don't need to convince coffee growers to sell them their best stock. Blue Tokai's founders understood early on that well-heeled Indians are willing to pay extra for specialty coffee roasted in smaller batches and customised for different palates. Rohan Kuriyan, a second-generation coffee grower and exporter, credits Blue Tokai with changing the tide for India's specialty coffee market. ""People started to see Blue Tokai as a benchmark and they realised that there is money to be made in coffee,"" he says. And eventually more homegrown brands - Third Wave Coffee, Sleepy Owl etc - have found their niche. But analysts say this is still a nascent industry.  ""You could have 1,000 of these cafes and you'll still be hard pressed to find one specialty coffee cafÃ© next to you,"" says Arvind Singhal, a consultant at Technopak Advisors. He adds that it's the same with the artisanal cheese industry.  VG Siddhartha: The coffee king of India ""There are about two dozen start-ups across India. But it's not yet mainstream. The dairy market is worth billions of dollars - the artisanal cheese market is just $10m-$20m. The same goes for these specialty premium coffees."" Until 1991, when economic reforms opened India up to the world, coffee growers sold their beans to the federal government-backed Coffee Board of India, which then auctioned the produce to buyers. But after 1991, when growers could market and sell their coffee, Mr Kuriyan's father and other growers started travelling abroad. ""They wanted to learn how we could improve our overall quality of coffee grown here in India,"" says Mr Kuriyan, whose coffee estate in southern India's hilly Chikmagalur district is more than 80 years old. Production increased, but most of it was exported. In 1993, India exported 2.1 million 60kg bags - the standard unit of measurement for coffee trading - according to the Coffee Board of India. By 2010, the number more than doubled to 4.6 million 60kg bags.   As the coffee market opened, entrepreneurs like VG Siddhartha set up the CafÃ© Coffee Day (CCD) chain where thousands of Indians tasted their first cappuccinos. CCD's first cafe in Bangalore city in 1996 became an instant hit among both students and corporate executives.  Cafes like these were ideal and accessible for young people looking for a place to meet friends. With cheap coffee - a rarity at the time - it was also an obvious choice for young working people. By 2011, driven by an aspirational Indian middle class, there were more than 1,000 CCD cafes, ushering in a new coffee culture.  Starbucks arrived a year later, seven years after another international brand, Costa Coffee, debuted. By then, Indians were willing to pay more for coffee  But Indian coffee habits haven't changed much in all this time - they still like the concoction with a healthy dose of milk and sugar. The closest thing to that - cappuccino - is Blue Tokai's best-selling coffee.  Indians also love sweet, milky cold coffee, available in Indian markets long before the arrival of coffee shops. And that's what inspired entrepreneurs Arman Sood, Ajai Thandi and Ashwajeet Singh to set up Sleepy Owl in 2016. ""We wanted to do India's first cold-brewed coffee that goes well with milk or drunk black, which can be home-delivered,"" Mr Sood says. They also wanted to reach customers who preferred a cup of instant coffee. ""Not everyone in India was ready for manual brewing using a French Press or an Aeropress. It had to be something simpler."" They focused on convenience rather than estate names and tasting notes, which they say could have scared away new clients. After the cold brew packs became a hit, Sleepy Owl launched ""hot brew sachets"" - ground arabica that can be dipped in hot water like a tea bag. They now sell in 2,000 stores across India, and even on domestic airlines. Specialty coffee picks up The uptick in demand also changed the scene for coffee growers.  Back in 2012, Mr Kuriyan was only exporting coffee to roasters in Sweden, Norway and the US. But soon after he was supplying Blue Tokai with export-quality arabica from his Merthi Subbangudigy Estate (MS Estate). ""What Matt [Chitharanjan] did was focus on single-estate specialty coffees and he was willing to take the risk of marketing high-priced coffee. His whole modus operandi was focusing on a niche market that knew what good coffee is,"" Mr Kuriyan says. But other growers disagreed - they thought high-priced, good-quality coffee wouldn't take off in a price-sensitive Indian market. ""One grower said I'll sell you the coffee but mix it with robusta (a cheaper, stronger-tasting coffee bean) or chicory (a woody plant used as a coffee substitute) and bring the price down or you are going to fail,"" Mr Chitharanjan recalls. But his bet paid off. Today, MS Estate is the most popular medium roast at Blue Tokai, Mr Chitharanjan says. And domestic growers such as Mr Kuriyan also grew more confident. Other homegrown roasters followed suit.  ""We decided to source green coffee beans and roast it ourselves because we thought it would be great to show the customer the quality of coffee on offer - from sourcing from farms to the roasting process,"" says Ayush Bathwal, co-founder of Third Wave Coffee. He says that coffee-drinkers now want to know where their coffee is coming from, how it's sourced and how it's roasted.  ""We saw the pride that our farm partners took in seeing their coffees being served with their farm names at our coffee shops in Bangalore,"" Mr Bathwal says. ""Coffee is now more than a transactional, social beverage - unlike what it was in the past."""
'I'm Australian but Ukraine is part of my identity',2022-03-20T00:48:47.000Z,"Dmytro Matsypura is boiling with anger about Russia's assault on his homeland as he addresses an anti-war rally in Australia's biggest city. A university professor in Sydney, Matsypura says he's willing to fight in Ukraine. ""I can do much more being here and helping, but if necessary I have no reservations to pick up a gun [and] go,"" he tells the BBC. ""My father is sitting with his hunting rifle - at the window - waiting for the invaders to come in so that he can shoot them, and my father is over 70 years old."" With both his parents and in-laws in Ukraine, he tells me he is ""worried sick"".   ""We don't sleep very much. It's a nightmare I wouldn't wish on anybody,"" he says. ""The whole invasion fills me with rage towards this army that came to invade us, and I have a hard time containing that."" Kyiv is 15,000km (9,320 miles) from Sydney, but for many in the Ukrainian diaspora the conflict feels unbearably close. Inside the St Andrews Ukrainian Catholic Church on a rainy Sunday, the Melbourne-born priest, Father Simon Ckuj, tells the congregation that forgiveness is a virtue. ""If we allow ourselves to be overcome by our human passions, by our anger and, God forbid, by our hatred, then we are fallen,"" he says. ""We become no better than the enemy doing the work of the evil one.""  After the service, Father Ckuj explains his reaction to the Russian invasion. ""At first it was shock. Now it is an uncontrollable grief,"" he says. ""Do we pray for [Vladimir] Putin? Yes, we have to pray for Putin for his conversion, for him to withdraw from Ukraine, for him to do penance and for him to face the consequences of his actions."" Outside the church, the Australian flag flies alongside its Ukrainian counterpart - a blue and yellow emblem that has become a symbol of global resistance. ""I am proudly Australian butâ¦ being Ukrainian is part of my identity,"" says Teresa Huzij, whose grandparents fled Ukraine after World War Two. For her elderly grandmother, history feels like it is being repeated.  ""My mother's mother, who is still alive at almost 99 years of age, said 'it's happening again'. She cameâ¦ because Australia was the only country who would take her as a widow with a child. ""I have family on my mum and dad's side in Ukraine and I am messaging them every day by social media, hearing from them. It is excruciating. But Ukrainians have always been and will always be free because that is who we are. Olexa Matiouk's parents moved to Australia when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. His grandparents and cousins still live there. ""It's been intense, but we are in contact with them on a daily basis. It's a very jarring routine,"" Matiouk tells the BBC. ""You wake up, you log on to social media to see what's happening and you're hoping no-one you know has died or been injured."" Ukrainians have a long history in modern Australia.   One of the first migrants was a soldier who sailed to Australia in the 1860s and started a sheep farm. Refugees would arrive in the late 1940s, and migration from Ukraine increased following its independence in 1991. ANALYSIS: Where are Ukraine's two million refugees now? In Sydney, protesters have rallied every day to express their opposition to Vladimir Putin's invasion. At times, demonstrators from Belarus and Russia have joined their Ukrainian cousins.  ""It is a massive mistake. We can see it now,"" says Alexey Pustovoyt, a migrant from St Petersburg in Russia, President Putin's home city. ""I can't get it why he [Putin] decided to go. There is no excuse. You can't do this. It's the 21st Century."" His condemnation is echoed by Tatsiana, a Belarusian protester. ""I do not know a single Belarusian who sincerely supports what is happening. We all pray for Ukraine; we all hope for (its) freedom,"" she says. The Australian government has said the Russian invasion is ""a wholesale breach of international law [and] a completely unprovoked and unjustified attack on its neighbour"".   Prime Minister Scott Morrison said China - which has supported Russia's economy as western sanctions bite - had more power than anyone else to bring the conflict to an end. ""I was listening for the voice of the Chinese government when it came to condemning the actions of Russia and there was a chilling silence,"" he said in a speech to the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based research organisation.  There are fears here, too, that the invasion of Ukraine has fomented a ""troubling new strategic convergence"" between Beijing and Moscow that could embolden China's regional territorial ambitions. What Morrison called a ""new arc of autocracy"" that would ""challenge and reset the world order"" also has spy chiefs worried. FORECAST: Five ways the war in Ukraine might end ""We're going to have to work much harder to maintain the liberal quality of the rules-based order in Europe and here in the Indo-Pacific region,"" said Andrew Shearer, director general of Australia's Office of National Intelligence. But for the Ukrainian diaspora, their world has already been upended. There is despair, but there is also defiance. ""We have this unity, we have this support,"" explained Dmytro Matsypura. ""It fills me with this feeling that we are not alone, and we can win this.""   "

Long Covid: What is it and what are the symptoms?,2022-03-10T14:52:27.000Z,"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates about 1.5 million people in the UK have ""long Covid"".  Most people who catch Covid don't become severely ill and get better relatively quickly.  But some have long-term problems after recovering from the original infection - even if they weren't very ill in the first place. Long Covid isn't fully understood, and there's no internationally-agreed definition - so estimates of how common it is, or what the main symptoms are, vary.  Guidance for UK health professionals refers to symptoms that continue for more than 12 weeks which cannot be explained by another cause.  According to the NHS, these can include: extreme tiredness shortness of breath, chest pain or tightnessproblems with memory and concentration (""brain fog"")changes to taste and smelljoint pain  But patient surveys suggest a range of other symptoms may also be present, including gut problems, insomnia and vision changes. It is crucial to remember these symptoms can have other causes too.  There's a lot of research investigating the potential long-term impact of coronavirus.  One study suggests Covid may affect the brain, with a slight shrinkage in size visible after infection.  Another suggests some people with long Covid have lung abnormalities.  But the significance of these changes and whether they are permanent is unknown. And the severity of problems also varies enormously. Some people will have no issues continuing with their day-to-day lives, while others may struggle. 'I have to choose between walking and talking''My shame over long Covid 18-month work absence' There is currently no standard test. People suspected of having it are checked for other issues like diabetes, thyroid function and iron deficiency first, before being offered a long Covid diagnosis.  A blood test could become available in the future.  We don't know.  It could be that the initial infection sends some people's immune systems into overdrive, meaning they attack not just the virus but their own organs. The virus entering and damaging our cells might explain some symptoms like a loss of smell and taste, while damage to blood vessels could, for example, contribute to heart problems.  It is likely several different things are going on in different people, causing a wide range of problems.  This is difficult to pin down because medics only recently started recording long Covid. The ONS estimates about 1.5 million people in the UK have symptoms for more than four weeks. Of those, 71% first caught the virus at least 12 weeks previously, and 45% at least a year earlier. The ONS asked people to record their own symptoms, and suggests the condition is most common in:  35 to 49-year-oldswomen people with underlying conditions which limit their activitiesthose working in health, social care or educationpeople living in poorer areas Children are less likely than adults to catch Covid and therefore less likely to develop long Covid - but some still do.  In August 2020, leading experts said they were reassured after a large study showed persistent symptoms were less common than first feared.  A team of researchers investigated more than 200,000 positive cases among 11 to 17-year-olds in the UK between September 2020 and March 2021. They estimated that between 4,000 and 32,000 were still experiencing symptoms 15 weeks later.  We don't know how severe the symptoms were, although there was little evidence that children were left bedridden or unable to attend school. However, researchers stress the risk to young people is ""not trivial"", and say it is vital that children get the right medical support. About 90 long Covid assessment centres have been set up across England. Similar clinics have opened in Northern Ireland, while in Scotland and Wales patients are referred to different services, depending on their specific symptoms. Currently there are no proven drug treatments, with the main focus on managing symptoms and gradually increasing activity where possible.  Studies on how best to improve the lives of people with long Covid are continuing.  NHS: Your Covid recovery website Some reports suggest people who have been vaccinated are less likely to have long Covid.  Vaccines help stop people contracting the virus in the first place - but infections can still occur, particularly when immunity starts to wane. Their main job is to prevent people getting very sick with Covid. They may also improve Covid symptoms, either immediately or over several weeks. And there is some evidence that jabs may help prevent infections ""turning into"" long Covid.  How do I get the vaccine and will I need a booster?"
FA Cup: Nottingham Forest tribute to Hillsborough victims,2022-03-20T13:45:35.000Z,"Nottingham Forest has left 97 seats vacant for their match with Liverpool to honour those who lost their lives due to the Hillsborough disaster. The clubs are meeting on Sunday for the first time in the FA Cup since their 1989 semi-final, which led to 97 spectators losing their lives. They are expected to be the only empty seats at the sell-out match at City Ground. Nottinghamshire Police have asked all fans to enjoy the match safely. Nottingham Forest said it was looking forward to welcoming 4,000 away fans. Despite the high demand for tickets, the club made 97 seats unavailable to purchase. Instead, they have been covered with a banner paying tribute to the Liverpool fans who lost their lives after overcrowding occurred on the terraces of Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989. Minute's applause for 97th Hillsborough victimThe 'very human lesson' from HillsboroughTimeline of the Hillsborough stadium disaster In 2016, inquests concluded that the fans who had died had been unlawfully killed.

"In Mariupol, children bear the brunt of Vladimir Putin's war",2022-03-20T15:59:47.000Z,"In his hospital bed, little Artem stares into space. He clutches a small yellow toy tractor but says nothing as specialist nurses monitor his condition. The Russian shell that blasted shrapnel into his belly also badly wounded his parents and grandparents as they tried to flee Mariupol. A victim of Putin's war and he's not yet three years old.   In the next bed to Artem lies 15-year-old Masha, also from near Mariupol. Her right leg was amputated after it was torn apart by the blast from a Russian shell last Tuesday.  The very worst of Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine and what the relentless Russian bombardment has done to the people trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol, can be seen at the Regional Children's Hospital in the nearby city of Zaporizhzhia. Hundreds of people have been evacuated here. Their physical wounds are obvious and may, to an extent, heal. The psychological trauma will live with them forever.  Doctors here and the children's surviving relatives, asked us to tell their stories, among them Dr Yuri Borzenko, head of the Children's Hospital. He can't hide his contempt for what Russia has done.  ""I hate Russia,"" says Dr Borzenko, without a flicker of emotion on his face. ""The girl who lost her leg (Masha) was so traumatised she wouldn't eat or drink for days. She couldn't mentally handle what had happened. We had to feed her intravenously.""  ""Another boy,"" says the doctor, ""a six-year-old, with shrapnel in his skull described - without any tears or emotion - watching his mother burn to death in their car after it was hit. Two days later he said 'dad buy me a new mum, I need someone to walk me to school'.""   What is happening in Mariupol is a humanitarian disaster, even - perhaps - a war crime. An estimated 90% of the city's buildings have been damaged or destroyed. After last week's destruction of a theatre where more than 1,000 people were sheltering, reports today that an arts school, with 400 people inside, has also been attacked.  Those who've been able to escape Mariupol talk of unimaginable horrors. First-hand accounts of bodies lying in the streets, of homes destroyed. Carrying those memories they put as much physical distance as they can between themselves and what they went through.  In a cafÃ© in the central city of Dnipro, which itself has come under Russian fire, we met Oksana Gusak. With her husband Andrii, and her parents, Oksana fled Mariupol last week through mined roads and a dozen hostile Russian army checkpoints.   Just drinking a glass of water now feels like a luxury for Oksana, after they had run out of everything in Mariupol. They all politely turn down our offer of coffee, saying it would be an insult to the family members they left behind in parts of Mariupol from where it was impossible to flee.  Her husband, Andrii, told me there was no water supply in the city, no power, no heating and no communications so they had no choice but to go.  ""Absolutely we were taking a risk but at that point I didn't care whether I'd die in Mariupol or die trying to get out,"" says Oksana.    ""We knew there was a chance, we'd be targeted and we realised we had to take that chance. If we would have stayed, the chances of surviving would be zero.""  Andrii and Oksana are fortunate to have escaped unharmed and with each other. They know that.

His daughter Natasha, who was 26, and his 4-year-old granddaughter Dominica, were killed when a Russian shell landed near the shelter where the whole family was seeking refugee from the bombardment of Mariupol.   ""I looked at the ground and there lay my little granddaughter with her head completely torn to pieces,"" says Vladimir. ""She lay there without a single breath and right next to her was my daughter with her legs fractured, open fractures.""  Dominica - whose pictures her grandfather almost caresses on his phone - was killed instantly. Her mother died from her injuries the next day.  As broken as he is, Vladimir is trying to stay strong for his second daughter, Diana. She was also critically wounded in the blast and was about to undergo emergency surgery.  But he could not hide his pain. ""God, why would you bring all this upon me? I was not supposed to bury my children, my lovely girls, I failed to protect you.""

Murder arrest over Sabita Thanwani Clerkenwell death,2022-03-20T15:34:35.000Z,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 19-year-old woman who died in student accommodation in central London.  Student Sabita Thanwani was found with neck injuries in the halls of residence in Sebastian Street, Clerkenwell. Police and medics went to Arbour House at about 05:10 GMT on Saturday but she died at the scene. Maher Maaroufe, understood to have been in a relationship with Ms Thanwani, has been arrested, police said. The 22-year-old was also arrested on suspicion of assault on police.

Child Q: Hackney march over strip-searched girl,2022-03-20T18:18:10.000Z,"Hundreds of protesters have marched through north London in support of a black pupil strip-searched at school after being wrongly suspected of carrying drugs.  A report released this month found the search of the 15-year-old girl, known as Child Q, was unjustified and racism was ""likely"" to have been a factor. Activists marched chanting ""power to black girl Child Q"" and carried banners saying ""protect black kids"". The Met Police has apologised.  The girl's family is suing her school and the force, which said its officers' actions ""should never have happened"". Speaking via her lawyers, the girl said she wanted ""cast-iron commitments to ensure this never happens again"" and thanked supporters.  Protesters marched from Stoke Newington Police Station to Hackney Town Hall with placards saying ""no to racist police"" and ""hands off our children"", while chanting ""love for Child Q"". Jacqueline Courteney, who helped set up the rally, said: ""I set it up because I'm a mother and I had that gut instinct a black child out there had been caused such harm, and that could have been my kids, or nieces and nephews. ""That's just not on, and there needs to be a way that we can demand change that is clear and obvious."" Ngozi Fulani, founder of charity Sistah Space which supports black heritage abuse victims, said she was ""disgusted"" by the incident.  ""There's something in our system that doesn't see the humanity in black people, much less black children,"" she said. ""The police involved should be sacked."" A two-minute silence was also held in support of the girl.  During the incident in 2020, the girl was taken out of an exam to the school's medical room and strip-searched while on her period by two female Met police officers searching for cannabis, while teachers remained outside. The girl's mother told the safeguarding review - by City of London and Hackney Safeguarding Children Partnership - that after the strip-search, her daughter had been ""asked to go back into the exam"" she had been sitting, with no teacher asking about her welfare. Her family said the girl had changed from ""top of the class"" to ""a shell of her former bubbly self"", and she was now self-harming and required therapy. The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) said its investigation was complete and its report was being ""finalised"". It added three police constables had been served with notices last year advising them they were under investigation for misconduct, ""over their roles in either carrying out the strip-search or involvement in supervising it"". Scotland Yard said the officers' actions were ""truly regrettable"" and it ""should never have happened""."

Saudi Aramco ramps up investment to boost production,2022-03-20T15:00:54.000Z,"The state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco plans to sharply increase the amount it invests in energy production, after it reported a doubling of profits in 2021. The firm aims to boost output significantly over the next five years. Energy prices have soared in recent months as demand has outstripped supplies of oil and gas. The war in Ukraine and a reluctance to rely on Russia for energy has added to the pressure to find additional sources of energy. Saudi Aramco's move is likely to be welcomed by political leaders worried about the impact of high energy prices, although the boost to investment is aimed at increasing output over the course of the next five to eight years. Last week prime minister Boris Johnson visited Saudi Arabia to try to persuade the country to release more oil into world markets in the short term. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and by raising production it could help to reduce energy prices which are currently at 14-year highs. However, the country has been condemned for a range of human rights abuses: its involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen, the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for jailing dissidents and for widespread use of capital punishment. The Labour Party accused the government of going ""cap in hand"" from one dictator to another to tackle the energy crisis. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the prime minister was ""absolutely right"" to engage with Saudi Arabia over increasing energy supplies. ""It would be wrong if we weren't exploring all the avenues we could to bring cheaper energy and more secure energy to people in this country,"" Rishi Sunak told the BBC. The prime minister had ""constructive dialogue"" about human rights abuses during the visit, he said. PM: I raised human rights with Saudi ArabiaWhy is turning to Saudi Arabia for oil controversial? Shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the UK should be focusing on boosting domestic production of energy through new nuclear and on and off-shore wind generation, to reduce reliance on states like Russia and Saudi Arabia. ""Getting to net zero is the mission of our generation,"" she said. ""We've got to do more to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, which is why investment in homegrown electricity is so important."" Energy markets have been volatile during the pandemic, as sudden changes in economic activity have influenced both supply and demand. In 2020 Saudi Aramco's profits dropped sharply as the world economy slowed. But a reopening in many countries led to a sharp rise in energy prices in 2021. That boosted revenues at all the large energy generating companies. Saudi Aramco said it planned to increase its capital expenditure to $45-$50bn this year with further increases until the middle of the decade. Last year capital expenditure was $31.9bn. It would raise its crude oil ""maximum sustainable capacity"" to 13 million barrels a day by 2027, the company said. It also aims to increase gas production by more than 50% by 2030. Saudi Arabia produced just over 10 million barrels of oil per day in February. The oil company more-than doubled its net profit to $110bn in 2021, up from $49bn in 2020. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil increased by around 50% in 2021 and, with energy prices remaining high, analysts expect profit to increase further in 2022. Saudi Aramco said it planned to develop a significant hydrogen export capability and become a global leader in carbon capture and storage technology."
Murder charge after body found buried in Northampton garden,2022-03-20T15:46:28.000Z,"A woman has been charged with murder after a body was found buried in a garden.  The body was found in the garden of a house in Moore Street, Kingsley in Northampton, on Saturday.

Ms Beal, of Moore Street, is due to appear at Northampton Magistrates' Court on Monday. Northamptonshire police said they began searching the property after being called to the house on Wednesday. Forensic officers and specialist search teams, including a cadaver dog, were deployed and the body found on Saturday afternoon, the force said. The remains are expected be taken to Leicester where they will be forensically examined by a Home Office pathologist. Det Ch Insp Adam Pendlebury said: ""Regrettably, I can confirm that a body has been found in the rear garden of the address.

"Isle of Wight e-scooter complaints exceed 1,000",2022-03-20T19:23:16.000Z,"More than 1,000 incidents of misuse of e-scooters have been reported during a trial on the Isle of Wight, it has emerged. A council pilot hire scheme has been operating on the island for 15 months. A Freedom of Information (FOI) request revealed complaints had been filed over anti-social behaviour, dangerous and underage riding, as well as riding on the pavement. Operator Beryl said misuse of its vehicles were ""highly disruptive"". The FOI by an island resident, and released by the Local Democracy Reporting Service, showed that in the 12 months following the start of the scheme in November 2020, 1,004 misuse reports were filed with Isle of Wight Council. They included 87 for anti-social behaviour, 178 for dangerous driving on the road and 235 for riding with a passenger. Underaged riding prompted 141 complaints and there were 262 for riding on a pavement. Last week, Hampshire Constabulary's roads unit issued 14 warning letters during an operation targeting riders of both private and hired e-scooters in Ryde and Newport. Beryl said: ""Riders can expect a warning in the first instance, and to be blocked on a second occurrence. ""Misuse is highly disruptive and potentially dangerous to other road users."" Trials of e-scooter hire schemes are being carried out around the country, with evidence gathered due to be evaluated by the Department for Transport as itÂ considers whether to legalise them. Currently, privately-owned e-scooters are banned in the UK anywhere except on private land. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk."

Ukraine conflict: Russia trying to starve Mariupol into surrender - MP,2022-03-21T09:27:52.000Z,"A Ukrainian MP has accused Russia of trying to starve the besieged port city of Mariupol into surrendering. Dmytro Gurin was speaking soon after Ukraine rejected a Russian deadline demanding Mariupol's defenders lay down their arms in exchange for safe passage out of the city. Mariupol is a key strategic target for the Russian military. Around 300,000 people are believed to be trapped there with supplies running out and aid blocked from entering. Residents have endured weeks of Russian bombardment with no power or running water.  Mr Gurin said there was no question of Mariupol surrendering.  ""Russians don't open humanitarian corridors, they don't let humanitarian convoys enter the city and we clearly see now that the goal of the Russians is to start to [create] hunger [in the city] to enforce their position in the diplomatic process,"" he said. ""If the city does not surrender, and the city will not surrender, they won't let people out. They won't let humanitarian convoys into the city."" Under the proposal, which Ukraine had until 05:00 Moscow time (02:00 GMT) to accept, Russian troops would have opened safe corridors out of Mariupol from 10:00 Moscow time, initially for Ukrainian troops and ""foreign mercenaries"" to disarm and leave the city. After two hours, Russian forces say they would then have allowed humanitarian convoys with food, medicine and other supplies to enter the city safely, once the de-mining of the roads was complete. But the deadline came and went. Should Russia capture Mariupol, it would help it create a land corridor between the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, controlled by Russian-backed separatists and Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. So far though, Mariupol's defenders have stood firm.  LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyANALYSIS: Putin's redrawn the world - but not as he wantedBATTLEFIELD: What have been Russia's military mistakes?WATCH: Drone footage shows Mariupol devastationIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the war There are mounting concerns about the humanitarian situation, with Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a Ukrainian MP from Mariupol, calling it ""hell on Earth"".  Residents spend most of their time in shelters and basements as Russia continues its unrelenting attack on the city, from land, air and sea, officials say. Pictures show a city in ruins, with entire neighbourhoods devastated. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, estimated that over 80% of residential buildings had either been damaged or destroyed, a third of them beyond repair. Bodies are being left in the streets as it is too dangerous to get them. Mr Gurin said teams were still unable to clean the rubble of a theatre which Ukrainian officials say was bombed by Russia last Wednesday. Hundreds of people are believed to remain trapped in the basement, which withstood the attack. Moscow denies targeting the building. ""The services cannot clean this rubble because the shelling never stops and bombing never stops. It's really dangerous,"" he said. He could not give an estimate on how many people had managed to flee the area as ""we don't have connection with Mariupol"". Since the war began, authorities say at least 2,500 people have been killed in Mariupol although the true figure may be higher.  Previous efforts to evacuate Mariupol's civilians have been blocked by Russian fire, although local authorities say that thousands have been able to leave in private vehicles. On Sunday, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister said 3,985 people had fled from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, adding that on Monday the government plans on sending about 50 buses to pick up further evacuees from the city.   President Volodomyr Zelensky has said the Russian siege amounts to a ""war crime"". ""This is a totally deliberate tactic,"" he said. ""They [Russian forces] have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an 'argument' for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers"".

Morad Tahbaz: British-US national detained in Iran on hunger strike,2022-03-21T14:44:08.000Z,"The family of a British-US national who they expected to be freed by Iran last week as part of a deal with the UK has gone on hunger strike, they say. Morad Tahbaz, 66, who also has Iranian citizenship, has been confined to a hotel, the Foreign Office has said. His sister Taraneh told the BBC his family was ""absolutely distraught"" and feared he would be forgotten about. The Foreign Office says it is continuing to lobby Iran at the highest levels for Mr Tahbaz to be released. Hopes had been raised that Mr Tahbaz would be freed when Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released and flew back to the UK on Thursday, but he was returned to Evin prison on Friday. The Foreign Office said it had been informed by the Iranians this move was in order for Mr Tahbaz to have an electronic ankle bracelet fitted. On Sunday, the Foreign Office said he had been moved to a hotel in Tehran. Appearing alongside Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe at a news conference on Monday, Mr Tahbaz's daughter, Roxanne, said the family had been led to believe her father would be released with the other dual nationals. ""From the outset, we were always assured by the [UK government] that my father would be included in any deal that was made to release all of the hostages. ""So we're truly devastated, knowing now that this was not the case."" Roxanne Tahbaz said the family ""just want them [the UK government] to do whatever they have to do"" to bring her father and mother, who is also subject to a travel ban inside Iran, back home. Speaking on the Today programme earlier, Taraneh Tahbaz said Mr Tahbaz had gone on hunger strike. ""He continues to be used as a pawn on a chessboard and it's very distressing,"" she said. "" We're agonised and we're absolutely distraught and we don't know what the next moves are."" Mr Tahbaz was doing conservation work when he was held in Iran in January 2018.  He and seven other conservationists were accused of collecting classified information about Iran's strategic areas under the pretext of carrying out environmental and scientific projects. The conservationists - members of Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation - had been using cameras to track endangered species including the Asiatic cheetah and Persian leopard, according to Amnesty International. UK-born Tahbaz Man released in Nazanin deal back in Iran jailWho are the dual nationals jailed in Iran? All eight denied the charges and Amnesty International said there was evidence that they had been subjected to torture in order to extract forced ""confessions"". He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with his colleagues on vague charges of spying for the US and undermining Iran's security. Last year, UN human rights experts warned that Mr Tahbaz, who has cancer and has twice had Covid, had been denied access to proper treatment in prison despite his health condition deteriorating.

Smacking children in Wales becomes illegal,2022-03-21T12:12:34.000Z,"Parents smacking their children will be illegal in Wales from Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was a ""historic"" day for children as Wales becomes the second UK nation to ban physical punishment. The legal defence of reasonable punishment has been removed, so anyone who smacks a child in their care could be arrested and prosecuted for assault. Critics claim the new law was pushed through ""by those who think they know better than parents"". Jersey was the first part of the British Isles to ban smacking in April 2020 before Scotland became the first UK nation to make it illegal in November 2020. Sweden became the first country in the world to ban physical punishment of children in 1979 and it is now illegal in 63 nations around the world. 'Time outs' don't do any harm, parents toldHow parents' arguments really affect their childrenKirstie Allsopp: 'I smashed my kids' iPads' The Welsh government said it was a ""historic moment for children and their rights in Wales"" and meant children would have the same rights as adults. In a survey of 3,000 adults in England, the NSPCC found 64% think it is also time to change the law there and ban smacking, while 68% said it is not acceptable. Ministers in Cardiff said they wanted to give children ""the best start in life"" and the new law means people will be committing a crime if they smack, hit, slap or shake a child in their care.  The government said it ""wasn't possible to give a set list of what makes up physical punishment"" because it could be ""anything where a child is punished using physical force"". The new law will apply to parents or anyone who is responsible for a child while the parents are absent - and apply to all visitors to Wales. Physical punishment is already illegal in schools, children's homes, local authority foster care homes and childcare settings. Hitting a child is common assault but if a parent or someone with parental responsibility was charged with common assault against a child before Monday, they could have attempted to use the defence of reasonable punishment.  But from Monday, that defence is no longer available in Wales so anyone who physically punishes a child will be breaking the law and could get a criminal record. People who see a child being physically punished have been advised by Welsh government to either call the police if a child is in immediate danger or contact their local social services department. Welsh Parliament members voted 36 votes to 14 when it passed the law two years ago. The ban follows a campaign by children's charities and politicians and Wales' deputy social services minister Julie Morgan said she was ""thrilled"" that children have the same protection from assault as adults. Mr Drakeford added that there was ""no place for physical punishment in a modern Wales"" as he welcomed into law one of his flagship policies. ""The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child makes it clear that children have the right to be protected from harm and from being hurt and this includes physical punishment,"" he said. ""That right is now enshrined in Welsh law. No more grey areas. No more defence of reasonable punishment. That is all in the past."" Wales' children's commissioner said children now had ""clear and unambiguous precedence and protection"". The challenges of positive parentingFive top tips for parents ""As adults, we do not accept physical violence in any part of our lives,"" said Sally Holland. ""And as a nation we are clear today that we do not accept it in our children's lives either."" Plaid Cymru, which has a co-operation deal with the Welsh Labour government, backed giving children ""equal protection against violence under the law"". NSPCC Cymru said it backed ""positive parenting"" while Barnardo's Cymru said it was ""confident this legislation will drive forward the cultural change in parenting"". But members of the opposition group in the Welsh Parliament said they were ""worried"" it could create a ""Stasi culture"" in Wales - referring to the old East German secret police. ""The smacking ban is an unnecessary, unworkable and undesired law that was pushed through the Senedd by those who think they know better than parents,"" said Gareth Davies, the Welsh Conservatives' spokesman for social services. ""I am very worried about campaigns that encourage a Stasi culture in Wales where people - and children - are encouraged to shop parents, who discipline their children in what they deem a proportionate manner, to the police. ""This guidance flies in the face of the assurances that ministers gave to the Welsh people and there are justified concerns that the police will come under further pressure if the new regime leads to false claims and busybodies taking advantage. ""The Labour government in Cardiff Bay are clearly more interested in new age dogma rather than respecting parents."" Simon Calvert of Campaign group Be Reasonable, which opposes the ban, said it could ""criminalise ordinary decent loving mums and dads for doing nothing more than our loving mums and dads did with us"". He added: ""I think that some families will suffer unjustly as a result of this law and I think that we're going to see increasing calls in the years to come for this law to be revisited."" But one parenting blogger said it was ""not as simple as 'the ban is right' or the 'ban is wrong'"". Claire Campbell-Adams of the Mum's Shoulders blog said it was ""brilliant"" that the ban closes ""a loophole"" so abusers can longer use the defence. But she is concerned it could make it more difficult for parents who need support to open up. ""If you take away the ability to sit and chat with your peers about it because you're afraid of being prosecuted for it then how is that going to help anybody?"" said Ms Campbell-Adams from Newport. She added parents should be offered help and resources to understand how best to discipline their children.

"Chancellor must do more to help poorest households, charity says",2022-03-21T07:58:52.000Z,"A leading debt charity is calling on the chancellor to use this week's Spring Statement to do more to help poorer households. StepChange is calling on Rishi Sunak to increase welfare benefits and offer more help with energy bills. Without that, many more people will fall into ""problem debt"" the charity said. Mr Sunak told the BBC he cannot ""fully protect"" people from the consequences of rising prices. The debt charity wants the government to consider increasing benefits by at least 7% in April to try to match the rate at which prices are rising. It wants to see more funding for local councils to support people with vouchers, grants or discretionary payments to cover essential bills. StepChange is also calling for an expansion of the Warm Home Discount and wants energy companies to stop trying to recover debt from people who cannot afford to pay their bills. It comes as the charity has released the results of a survey, which suggests that one in five people believe they will end up in debt this year and won't be able to pay it back. Of 1,676 adults surveyed by YouGov for StepChange, 42% of people said they think they will struggle to pay rising energy bills and council tax in the coming months. Modelling from the debt charity also found that if energy bills hit Â£3,000 per year - which the industry has suggested could happen - the most financially vulnerable households will be spending Â£1 in every Â£6 they earn on energy costs. StepChange's campaign is the latest in a growing chorus of calls for the government to take further action when the chancellor makes his Spring Statement this week. On Wednesday the chancellor is expected to provide an update on the overall health of the economy, but the Spring Statement does not usually include large changes to tax or spending policies.  Rishi Sunak told BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""I wish government could solve absolutely every problem and that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. ""I can't do that, but what I would say is, I will stand by them in the same way that I have done in the past couple of years."" Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by Â£693Cost of living crisis: Sunak's menu of options Millions of households will see sharp rises in energy bills from next month, when the government's price cap is set to rise. The higher cap means typical households face paying Â£1,971 a year from April, 54% more than they pay now, with a further rise expected in October. The price of petrol and diesel has also soared in recent weeks, worsened by a surge in oil costs due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. More than 50 Conservative MPs are calling for a cut in fuel duty to reduce the price of petrol and diesel. One of them, former housing minister Robert Jenrick said: ""I think household incomes are entering a storm and they are going to be battered from all sides, energy, food, interest rates rising and so there is a role from the Treasury now to try to smooth the effect of this shock."" Carl Emmerson, the deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank told the BBC's Today programme that cutting fuel duty would provide targeted help for individuals and businesses who buy a lot of motor fuel. He said that the move was something that the chancellor could afford, but added: ""I think the problem with cutting fuel duty is that it never turns out to be temporary"". Fuel duty is supposed to rise automatically every year but has been frozen for more than 10 years. Mr Emmerson also suggested that the chancellor will need to choose between broader help, which will offer some help for most households, or more targeted interventions which would offer greater assistance to those on the lowest incomes. ""If you go broad, you can only really shield people from a bit of the pain"", he said. StepChange chief executive Phil Andrew said that the coming months will be ""dire"" for financially vulnerable people. ""Government must pull every lever at its disposal in order to protect those on the lowest incomes from the scars of debt and destitution.  ""While the initial raft of support announced in February was welcome, the war in Ukraine has exacerbated an already difficult situation and more action is clearly needed,"" he added.

William and Kate dance and taste chocolate during day two of Belize tour,2022-03-20T22:34:18.000Z,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been dancing with locals and sampling chocolate at a cocoa farm as they explored Belize. ""They were shaking their waists like nobody's business,"" said Laura Cacho, a local festival organiser who danced with William. On the second day of their Caribbean tour, the royals visited the Che 'il chocolate farm They ground cacao nibs, before the future king jokingly asked for a job. The duke and duchess were rewarded with a taste of the products at the family-run cocoa farm in the village of Maya Center in southern Belize, with Catherine admitting their children would be ""jealous"". The duke and duchess later showed off their moves on the dancefloor as they experienced the culture of the Garifuna community in the coastal village of Hopkins. Ms Cacho, 57, said it was a ""pleasure"" to dance with William. ""He shook his waist to the music. He had beautiful rhythm. It was a pleasure for me. ""Kate was excellent as well and definitely has Garifuna culture in her."" Earlier, during the trip to the cocoa farm, the royal couple learnt first-hand about the work that goes into producing the chocolate. William, 39, who had been pounding away with a mortar and pestle made from volcanic rock, quipped about swapping his royal day job for one on the farm, asking the owner, Julio Saqui: ""Do you take apprentices? ""Can I come and work for you? It's my kind of thing."" The duke and duchess were shown cocoa trees laden with fruit, with Catherine, 40, asking the owner's brother, Narcisio, how often they are harvested. As they took a break from the blistering sun under a marquee, the royal couple heard from Narcisio about the importance of the cocoa bean. The Saqui family are part of Belize's Maya community, where the cocoa bean is sacred and has been a key part of their culture for thousands of years. The cocoa bean was once considered more valuable than gold to the Maya people, who served it to royalty and continue to offer it to important guests.

The couple later got to taste some of the farm's goods as they dipped tortilla chips into chocolate fountains, and tried hot chocolate made from organic products. The duchess admitted the couple's three children - Prince George, eight, Princess Charlotte, six, and Prince Louis, three - would be ""very jealous"".

The Cambridges' visit to the Akte 'il Ha cacao farm in Indian Creek village was cancelled amid a reported dispute between villagers and Fauna and Flora International (FFI), which has William as patron, over land owned by the conservation organisation. Residents are also reported to have raised concerns saying they were not consulted about plans for the couple's helicopter to land on a local football pitch. Kensington Palace and the Belize government confirmed the schedule change, while a spokesman for FFI said the charity would ""support the livelihoods, educational opportunities and the customary rights of local people"" as part of its project in the area. On landing at Belize City's Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport on Sunday, the duke and duchess were greeted by Belize's governor general and a guard of honour from the Belize Defence Force. They royal couple later met Prime Minister Johnny Briceno and his wife Rossana, with Mr Briceno telling them: ""We're so happy you're here.""  The royal couple will also visit Jamaica and the Bahamas as part of their eight-day tour, with highlights set to include a sailing regatta in the Bahamas in honour of the Queen's 70-year reign, and a celebration of Jamaica's musical and sporting heritage.

Covid: Spring booster jab launches for over-75s and high risk in England,2022-03-21T08:09:39.000Z,"People aged 75 and over, residents in care homes and those with weakened immune systems can now book an extra booster jab against Covid in England.  It comes as official figures show infection rates are rising in all age groups - including the over-70s.  The rollout follows recommendations from the UK's vaccine advisers who say additional jabs will help boost protection for the most vulnerable.  Spring boosters are already being rolled out in Wales and Scotland.  A wider booster programme - involving more people - is expected this autumn.   It comes as the UK is seeing rising cases of Covid, with an estimated one in every 20 people infected, according to latest figures.  Health Secretary Sajid Javid said that people with symptoms of the virus should ""behave sensibly"" but he said that it would be down to the individual to decide whether or not to take a test. ""I think we need to step back and think about how we learn to live with Covid and focus on our very best form of defence and that's the vaccination programme,"" he said. The UK's only remaining Covid rules While vaccines have been shown to provide good protection against severe disease, protection wanes over time.  And as many of the oldest received their last jab in autumn 2021, their immunity may now be declining, experts say. Now, a second booster - to be administered six months after the previous dose, or sooner if deemed appropriate - will be offered to: adults aged 75 years and overresidents in a care home for older adultsindividuals aged 12 years and over who are immunosuppressed, or have weakened immune systems Over seven million people in the UK will be eligible to have the extra booster jab - with the first 600,000 people in England to be invited from this week. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for the NHS's vaccination programme, urged everyone eligible to book their boosters as soon as possible.  She said: ""With infections rising this is a really important opportunity for people who are eligible to come forward and get booked and get their spring booster."" Adults eligible for the jab will be offered the Moderna or Pfizer/BionNTech vaccineYoung people aged 12 to 18 will be offered the Pfizer/BioNTech jab The extra jabs will be given around six months after the last dose of vaccine.  Across the UK more than two-thirds of people aged over 12 have had two Covid vaccines plus a single booster jab.  UK seeing rising number of Covid infectionsBooster at least 80% effective against severe Omicron  A first booster dose is currently available for everyone aged 16 and over, and at-risk children aged 12 to 15. But up until now only people with severely weakened immune systems had been eligible for a fourth dose - three doses plus a booster.  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has suggested further boosters will be offered to a wider group of people in autumn. Experts believe winter is likely to be the season when the threat from Covid is greatest - for individuals, the NHS and care homes.  Recent research from the UK Health Security Agency has shown that the NHS booster programme has helped prevent around 157,000 hospitalisations since mid-December.  Despite this NHS hospitals have treated more than 100,000 patient with Covid since the start of the Omicron wave."
Climate change: IPCC scientists to examine carbon removal in key report,2022-03-21T00:53:21.000Z,"UN scientists are likely to weigh up technology to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, as they gather to finalise a key report. This idea will be one of many solutions considered over the next two weeks by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Also in attendance will be government officials from all over the world, who will need to approve every line in the summary report. It is due to be published on 4 April. Climate report is 'code red for humanity'Some impacts of global warming âirreversibleâ- UNFive things new IPCC climate change study tells us This new study will be the third of three important reports from the IPCC issued over the past eight months. The previous two have looked at the causes and impacts of climate change, but this one will focus on mitigation - or what we can do to stop it. This essentially means that researchers will look at how we can reduce the amount of warming gases that are emitted from human activities. However, the IPCC co-chair says this mitigation report will look more closely at ways of removing CO2 that's already in the atmosphere.  ""We have a lot more material, this time on carbon dioxide removal. That is, not putting carbon into the atmosphere, but getting it out again,"" said Prof Jim Skea, from Imperial College, London. ""The report was scoped out to cover the full spectrum of carbon dioxide removal approaches, which vary absolutely hugely, and the carbon dioxide that is removed can end up in very different stores and in very different places. So it was within the scope of the report to cover the whole lot, basically."" For more on carbon capture and storage listen to this episode of The Climate Question on BBC Sounds. The kind of carbon removal approaches the report will consider will likely include tree planting and agriculture, as well as the more advanced technological approaches that use large machines to remove the carbon from the air.   They will also look at combined approaches, where land is used to grow crops which can be burned for energy while the carbon is captured and buried.  The use of these types of technology is controversial. Campaigners express doubts that they can be made to work economically and there are also concerns that technology could be seen as an excuse not to make the major changes in energy production that are needed.  Scientists though say that the situation is now so serious that carbon dioxide removal will be needed in addition to massive cuts in emissions and not as a substitute for them. What ultimately emerges in the short summary for policymakers that will be published in two weeks, will depend on delicate negotiations with government representatives from 195 countries.  Researchers and officials will work through the summary line by line to agree the final text. There are some concerns that the war in Ukraine might have an impact on the meeting, with representatives from both Russia and Ukraine due to take part.   ""We have been running some informal meetings with governments to brief them ahead of the actual approval session,"" said Prof Skea. ""I would be optimistic that we would get full participation."" The new report, part of a regular review of the science dating back to 1990, will also have a new focus on the social aspects of cutting carbon. ""This chapter looks at the social science perspective of demand, and what motivates individual consumers, communities, businesses, to make responsible consumption, reduction, design and investment choices,"" said Dr Joyashree Roy, from Jadavpur University and the lead author of this part of the report.  ""Responsible production and consumption are also within the scope of this chapter, and we have also been asked to look into what are the drivers of behaviour change."" There will be much focus on short term actions that governments can take in the remaining years of this decade to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century.   This was assessed in 2018 as needing emissions to be cut in half by 2030 - but after the pandemic and with the likely ramping up of fossil fuel use in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine, the scale of emissions cuts may need revising upwards. Despite this, the report will likely emphasise that there is hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be avoided, if urgent action is taken. Prof Skea says the summary will not be ""unremitting doom and gloom."" ""What I think we have to convey in our report is that the activities of humans have caused climate change, but human beings also have the agency to do something about it."" ""And that I think is a really big part of the messaging for the report."" Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

War in Ukraine: Backlash in Russia against anti-war musicians,2022-03-20T18:11:36.000Z,"A few days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, one of Russia's largest media companies, Russian Media Group (RMG), released a statement explaining why it would no longer be playing certain artists on its popular radio stations or music TV channel.  ""The reason for this decision was the harsh statements these musicians made towards Russia in the context of the difficult situation between Russia and Ukraine,"" the statement read.  It explained that respect for its listeners was the company's top priority, and the ""arrogant and contemptuous attitude of the musicians towards Russian listeners"" left it no choice but to terminate its contract with the artists.  The list included several Ukrainian musicians and three Russian acts, including legendary rock group Aquarium, whose lead singer, Boris Grebenshchikov, had called the war ""madness"" in a post on Instagram. He is no stranger to political pressure.  ""I've spent half my life under some sort of ban"", Mr Grebenshchikov told the BBC. ""There were bans in the 70s, bans in the 80s - there's nothing unusual about it. Then the same people who ban you give you prizes.""  LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyANALYSIS: What is driving President Putin?RUSSIA: Anti-war opinions lose some their jobsWATCH: Drone footage shows Mariupol devastationIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the war The pressure on dissenting voices in the music industry marks a stark contrast to those artists who are loyal to the Kremlin, some of whom performed last week at a glitzy, made-for-TV stadium concert which featured Vladimir Putin as the headline act.  Tens of thousands of people waved Russian flags and chanted pro-Russian slogans at the event celebrating the eighth anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Many of them told the BBC they had been pressured to be there. On the first day of the war, Ukrainian singer Ivan Dorn published a video on Instagram calling for Russians to ""end this catastrophe"" and ""not to participate in this murderous war"".  Days later he found himself on the list of acts banned by the Russian Media Group, and his name appeared on another ""black list"" leaked to Russian media, demanding that certain musicians are banned from performing because of their anti-war views. The list was reportedly circulated to music venues and promoters in Russia. But Mr Dorn told the BBC that being blacklisted in Russia made no difference to him.  ""Any cooperation with Russia was impossible even before the announcement of any list,"" he said.  ""Does anyone within the organs of the Russian state really think we want to work with the aggressors who are exterminating the Ukrainian nation, murdering thousands of innocent people, building a totalitarian regime and putting their own people in jail for dissent?"" It isn't clear who created the ""black list"" or where it originated, and the BBC cannot confirm its authenticity, but music industry insiders say such documents are not uncommon.  ""It's never indicated where they come from - no name, phone number, email, official stamp. It can look like a fake - just a printed list with the names of musicians, writers or comedians,"" music manager Elena Saveleva told the BBC. Her client, rapper Noize MC, is on the list.  According to Ms Saveleva, pressure on promoters usually comes from regional security services, with officials turning up at concert halls and threatening them with closures and fines.  The art director of Moscow's oldest club, 16 Tons, believes the document could be fake.  ""I haven't seen it and no officials have come to see me, even though usually we are the first club they visit,"" Pavel Kamakin told the BBC.  The ambiguity surrounding the list's origin makes it difficult for promoters, musicians and venue owners to know how seriously to take it. Whatever its origins, the list reflects the increasingly unpredictable environment for people in Russia who disagree with the war.  For some musicians, that means the only option is to perform abroad.  Russian rapper Oxxxymiron, whose name appears on the ""black list"" circulated by Russian media, cancelled his upcoming tour in Russia and has instead organised charity concerts abroad - known as ""Russians Against War"" - to raise money for Ukrainian refugees.  He raised over $30,000 (Â£22,760) at a performance in Istanbul, and will appear in London later this week.  Announcing the postponement of his Russian tour, Oxxxymiron explained that he could not ""entertain people while Russian rockets fall on Ukraine, while residents of Kyiv are forced to hide in their basements and the metro, and while people are dying""."
"Newspaper headlines: Russia accused of genocide, and 'fuel duty cut'",2022-03-20T23:34:38.000Z,"Several papers lead with Voldymyr Zelensky's comments likening Vladimir Putin's offensive in Ukraine to the actions of the Nazis, as well as reports that civilians are being forced to relocate to Russia.  ""Russia accused of genocide"" is the Times' headline as fighting in the besieged south-eastern city of Mariupol escalated.  A school believed to have been sheltering about 400 people was bombed by Russian forces, the paper reports. Olha Stefanishyna, a deputy prime minister, accused Russia of genocide and of forcibly abducting thousands of Mariupol's residents, the paper adds.  Ukrainian authorities allege that civilians have been transported deep inside Russia to remote cities hundreds of miles from the border, the Daily Telegraph reports.  The Kremlin on Sunday gave Ukraine a deadline to surrender Mariupol by Monday morning UK-time.  UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was shocked by Russian atrocities in the Black Sea port, ""including attacks on schools sheltering civilians and the abduction and deportation of Ukrainians"", the paper adds. The Guardian carries the Ukrainian president's address to Israel's parliament in which he drew links between the Kremlin's offensive and the extermination of Jews during World War Two.  The leader challenged Israel over its failure to impose sanctions on Russia in what the paper calls an ""uncompromising address"" to the Knesset. Mr Zelensky, who is Jewish, said via video link that Mr Putin was waging an ""all-out war, illegitimate, intended to destroy our people, our country, our cities, our culture and our children. Everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainian"". ""Crime of the centuries"" is the headline dominating the front of Metro as it leads on Mr Zelensky's comments. There are also reports that troops opened fire on a care home, killing 56 pensioners in the eastern town of Kreminna, the paper adds. The i features a full page image of an elderly woman stood in front of a destroyed building in Ukraine, accompanied by the headline echoing Zelensky: ""Our neighbours want us dead"".  Moscow has been accused of ""horrific acts of genocide"" by Ukraine as it continues its bombardment, the paper adds, while Mr Zelensky called the attack ""a full scale war aimed at the destruction of our people"".  The UN has said that 10 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Sun says Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing pressure to cut fuel duty by at least 5p a litre as prices have risen sharply over recent weeks.  The paper says the cost of fuel has increase by about 20p a litre in the past month alone, with average prices at a record 165.9p for petrol and 177.3p for diesel. ""Don't be a fuel Rishi"" is the headline the paper has opted for. The Daily Mail reports that the chancellor is ""poised"" to cut fuel duty. The paper notes that Mr Sunak had initially hoped to avoid big spending measures in Wednesday's spring statement.  However, he is considering a temporary cut of up to 5p per litre in fuel duty in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. But some of his Conservative colleagues are urging more action to ease the cost of living crisis, the paper adds. Also leading on the possible cut in fuel duty, the Daily Express reports that Mr Sunak has acknowledged that pump prices are ""one of the biggest bills people face"" and has pledged to make a difference. Elsewhere, the Daily Mirror reports that the government has given P&O Ferries until 17:00 GMT on Tuesday to explain its decision to sack 800 members of staff.  The paper claims ministers knew on Wednesday what P&O bosses were intending to do, but failed to act. Labour is attempting to force a vote banning ""fire and rehire"", the paper reports. And finally, the Daily Star leads with comments made by Gavin Ashenden, a former chaplain to the Queen, that stores are doing the ""devil's work"" by filling hot cross buns with non-traditional ingredients, such as chocolate, caramel and cheese.

Money: Â£19bn in old UK banknotes and coins not cashed in,2022-03-20T15:37:11.000Z,"Almost Â£19bn in old banknotes are still being used, six months before paper Â£20 and Â£50 notes stop being legal tender. Paper Â£10 and Â£5 banknotes have already been withdrawn, while paper Â£20 and Â£50 notes cannot be used after 30 September 2022. They have been replaced with new plastic notes with a series of security features. However, the Bank of England said it will continue to swap old notes for their face value. There are also Â£105m of old one pound coins in circulation, according to the Royal Mint. Details of the cash still in circulation or hiding in homes was revealed in a Freedom of Information requests by BBC Wales. The Bank of England said 775 million paper banknotes remain in circulation. 113 million paper Â£5 notes remain in circulation73 million paper Â£10 notes remain in circulation360 million paper Â£20 notes remain in circulation209 million paper Â£50 notes remain in circulation The paper Â£5 notes were withdrawn in May 2017, and the paper Â£10 notes in March 2018, since when they have not been a legally accepted means of payment. In addition to the paper cash, the Royal Mint said about 105 million old-style Â£1 coins have not been returned. Out of the 1.6 billion that have been returned, about 1.45 million were counterfeits. Â£2 coins celebrating Dame Vera Lynn go on saleBanknote maker rocked as Covid affects suppliesThe Queen depicted on horseback on new 50p coin The round Â£1 coin was replaced by the 12-sided version in October 2017, to crack down on counterfeiting. The old-style coin can still be deposited at high street banks - but cannot be spent in shops. According to the Royal Mint, a company wholly owned by the UK Treasury, about 138 million round Â£1 coins were melted down to make some of the new ones at its base in Llantrisant in Rhondda Cynon Taf. The polymer Â£50 note featuring the portrait of Alan Turing entered circulation on 23 June 2021, meaning the Bank's entire collection of currently-printed banknotes is made of plastic. While the paper Â£5 and Â£10 notes are no longer legal tender, they will always be exchanged by the Bank of England. A spokeswoman explained that ""all genuine Bank of England banknotes that have been withdrawn from circulation retain their face value for all time"". People can also post old notes to the bank in Threadneedle Street, in the City of London, to be paid into a bank account, by cheque or, ""if you live in the UK and your exchange is worth less than Â£50"", swapped for new-style polymer ones. Old notes can also be taken there in person but the the bank warns of ""long queues and waiting times up to an hour"". If you have a UK bank account, the Bank of England said the simplest and quickest way to exchange paper Â£20 and Â£50 notes ""will normally be to deposit them with your bank"". The use of cash fell sharply during the coronavirus pandemic, as lockdowns reduced options for spending.  This accelerated a downward trend for the use of notes and coins. However, cash still accounted for 17% of all payments in 2020, according to the latest available figures by banking trade body UK Finance, making it the second most-popular way to pay after debit cards. Figures for 2021 will be published this summer.

Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on?,2022-03-21T00:00:23.000Z,"China and Hong Kong are seeing their largest spike in Covid cases in more than two years, despite determinedly pursuing one of the world's strictest virus elimination policies.  Most countries are now trying to live with coronavirus - so how long can China hold on to its ""zero-Covid"" goal?  For the last two years, China's strict measures to contain Covid, enforced by swift lockdowns and aggressive restrictions, seemed to be largely paying off.  As the rest of the world grappled with surges in cases and deaths in 2020, China's President Xi Jinping declared the country's handling of the pandemic through lockdowns and widespread testing a success - and touted its methods as being the most effective in dealing with the virus.  The zero-Covid model was therefore strictly enforced both in mainland China and Hong Kong. But things soon began to change.  The first signs of strain on the much-vaunted zero-Covid model in China began to appear when authorities were forced to impose increasingly large lockdowns triggered by the more infectious Delta variant in 2021. These started to raise questions about how long China could maintain this policy.  And now Omicron has called it further into question.  In mainland China, thousands of cases are now being reported each day and millions of people in the north-eastern province of Jilin have been placed under lockdown - the first time China had restricted an entire province since the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan.  Hong Kong, which was previously almost untouched by the virus, is now seeing 30,000 cases and more than 200 deaths a day. The city's healthcare system has been overrun, with shocking images of people in need of hospital care receiving rudimentary treatment outside medical facilities.  It's a situation unlike anything the country has seen for the past two years.  Officially, the Chinese government has not budged from its zero-Covid position. But there have been some signs that it may be softening its stance on how best to deal with the virus. Earlier this week, China's National Health Commission said it was changing its rules so that mild cases would be isolated in centralised locations, rather than treated in hospitals.  The criteria for a patient to be discharged from quarantine has also been lowered. ""In the past, China would actually admit every patient - whether they were asymptomatic or with just mild symptoms - to the hospital,"" Prof Jin Dong-yan of The University of Hong Kong told the BBC.  ""The fact they're now proposing to [locally isolate] them - that's one step to show they recognise that there's a large group of people that do not need much help."" During China's recent National People's Congress meeting, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also said China would continue to make its Covid-19 response more ""scientific and targeted"".  ""[Premier Li's speech] hints that the government is ready to be more flexible and loosen restrictions gradually,"" said Prof Chen Gang of the National University of Singapore.  ""Under [a more] dynamic policy, more emphasis will be placed on striking a balance between disease control and enabling people to live normal lives."" Businesses shut as China widens Covid lockdownsThe messy cost of China's harsh lockdown playbookHow Hong Kong's Covid plan went wrong On the ground as well, there's also been a noticeable shift in attitudes.  Last year, top Chinese epidemiologist Zhang Wenhong suggested that China would eventually need to ""co-exist"" with the virus. He was met with a barrage of criticism, with some calling him a traitor, and others saying he was colluding with foreign forces to undermine China's Covid response.  But just this week, Dr Zhang posted another message on Chinese social media that got a very different reception. While he said that it was necessary for China to maintain its zero-Covid strategy for now, he added that it should not be afraid to eventually move towards a more ""sustainable coping strategy"" in the future.  ""With this virus, alleviating fear is the first step we must take,"" he said. ""Omicron has become so mild, in countries that have achieved widespread vaccination and natural infection rates, it may be less deadly than even the flu."" This time, he was not met with vitriol - and was instead widely praised.  ""Thank you Dr Zhang for your scientific and rational [take] on issues,"" one comment said. Others shared their struggles over the past years - a sign of growing frustration after more than two years of lockdowns. ""These past few years, I have suffered a lot. I have lost my freedom - all in the name of the virus,"" one said. According to Professor Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, there is a sense that ""public support for zero-Covid is in decline"".  ""My sense is that especially in bigger cities like Shanghai, some people are saying it's just too much. While there's still overall public support for zero-Covid - it's being undermined by the recent Omicron wave,"" he said.  So how much longer can China hold on? Experts say we are unlikely to see any big moves this year, especially not now while it is in the throes of its biggest outbreak in years. Many believe loosening restrictions now could lead to an overwhelmed healthcare system - and a huge spike in the death rate.  All mainland China needs to do is look to Hong Kong to see a city struggling to contain its outbreak, with morgues filled to capacity and hospitals swamped with patients.  Prof Huang says China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been proclaiming the fact that it has avoided a significant number of deaths, and ""there is no doubt that opening will lead to a rapid increase in cases"". ""The dilemma is do you want to accept short-term pain - a significant increase of cases, deaths - for long-term stability?"" Analysts believe the answer is unlikely to be yes - especially right now. ""If restrictions are loosened, the number of deaths may shoot up, leading to social panic - something that will not be allowed in the politically sensitive year of the 20th party congress,"" said Prof Chen.  This Chinese Communist Party 20th party congress is one of the country's most important political events of the decade, and on paper, was when President Xi Jinping was supposed to step down, having come to the end of his two term-limit in office. But this limit was removed and there is growing certainty that Mr Xi will secure another term in power as party chief and come out of the congress ""more powerful than ever"", according to Michael Cunningham of research institution the Heritage Foundation.  ""The government usually shifts the pendulum toward preserving stability in party congress years, as those in power seek to avoid crises rather than make bold decisions that, if unsuccessful, could negatively impact their career prospects,"" said Mr Cunningham in a report.  Mr Xi himself said in a politburo meeting on Thursday that China would stick to its dynamic zero-Covid policy, saying: ""Victory comes from perseverance"".  With this clear instruction coming from the top, its more likely that officials will instead put in place smaller and gradual measures, similar to those already being made - but with no ""fundamental"" change - for now.  ""The problem with the zero-Covid policy is that it doesn't accept risks,"" says Prof Huang.   ""And unless [the Chinese government] is no longer obsessed with worst-case scenarios, you cannot expect to see a fundamental change to its policy."""
Not smart but clever? The return of 'dumbphones',2022-03-21T00:04:45.000Z,"Seventeen-year-old Robin West is an anomaly among her peers - she doesn't have a smartphone. Instead of scrolling through apps like TikTok and Instagram all day, she uses a so-called ""dumbphone"". These are basic handsets, or feature phones, with very limited functionality compared to say an iPhone. You can typically only make and receive calls and SMS text messages. And, if you are lucky - listen to radio and take very basic photos, but definitely not connect to the internet or apps. These devices are similar to some of the first handsets that people bought back in the late 1990s. Ms West's decision to ditch her former smartphone two years ago was a spur of the moment thing. While looking for a replacement handset in a second-hand shop she was lured by the low price of a ""brick phone"".  Her current handset, from French firm MobiWire, cost her just Â£8. And because it has no smartphone functionality she doesn't have an expensive monthly data bill to worry about. ""I didn't notice until I bought a brick phone how much a smartphone was taking over my life,"" she says. ""I had a lot of social media apps on it, and I didn't get as much work done as I was always on my phone."" The Londoner adds that she doesn't think she'll ever buy another smartphone. ""I'm happy with my brick - I don't think it limits me. I'm definitely more proactive."" Dumbphones are continuing to enjoy a revival. Google searches for them jumped by 89% between 2018 and 2021, according to a report by software firm SEMrush. And while sales figures are hard to come by, one report said that global purchases of dumbphones were due to hit one billion units last year, up from 400 million in 2019. This compares to worldwide sales of 1.4 billion smart phones last year, following a 12.5% decline in 2020. Meanwhile, a 2021 study by accountancy group Deloitte said that one in 10 mobile phone users in the UK had a dumbphone. ""It appears fashion, nostalgia, and them appearing in TikTok videos, have a part to play in the dumbphone revival,"" says Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at price comparison site Uswitch.com. ""Many of us had a dumbphone as our first mobile phone, so it's natural that we feel a sense of nostalgia towards these classic handsets."" Mr Doku says it was the 2017 relaunch of Nokia's 3310 handset - first released in 2000, and one of the biggest-selling mobiles of all time - that really sparked the revival. ""Nokia pushed the 3310 as an affordable alternative in a world full of high-spec mobiles."" He adds that while it's true that dumbphones can't compete with the latest premium Apple and Samsung models when it comes to performance or functionality, ""they can outshine them in equally important areas such as battery life and durability"". Five years ago, Przemek Olejniczak, a psychologist, swapped his smartphone for a Nokia 3310, initially because of the longer-lasting battery. However, he soon realised that there were other benefits. ""Before I would always be stuck to the phone, checking anything and everything, browsing Facebook or the news, or other facts I didn't need to know,"" he says. ""Now I have more time for my family and me. A huge benefit is that I'm not addicted to liking, sharing, commenting, or describing my life to other people. Now I have more privacy."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. However, Mr Olejniczak, who lives in the Polish city of Lodz, admits that initially the switch was challenging. ""Before I'd be checking everything, such as buses and restaurants, on my smartphone [when travelling]. Now that is impossible, so I have learned to do all those things beforehand at home. I got used to it."" One maker of dumbphones is New York company Light Phone. Slightly more clever that the norm for such products, its handsets do allow users to listen to music and podcasts, and link by Bluetooth to headphones. Yet the firm pledges that its phones ""will never have social media, clickbait news, email, an internet browser, or any other anxiety-inducing infinite feed"". The company says it recorded its strongest year for financial performance in 2021, with sales up 150% compared with 2020. This is despite its handsets being expensive for dumbphones - prices start at $99 (Â£75). Light Phone co-founder, Kaiwei Tang, says the device was initially created to use as a secondary phone for people wanting to take a break from their smartphone for a weekend for example, but now half the firm's customers use it as their primary device. ""If aliens came to earth they'd think that mobile phones are the superior species controlling human beings,"" he says. ""And it's not going to stop, it's only going to get worse. Consumers are realising that something is wrong, and we want to offer an alternative."" Mr Tang adds that, surprisingly, the firm's main customers are aged between 25 and 35. He says he was expecting buyers to be much older. Tech expert, Prof Sandra Wachter, a senior research fellow in artificial intelligence at Oxford University, says it is understandable that some of us are looking for simpler mobile phones. ""One can reasonably say that nowadays a smart phone's ability to connect calls and send short messages is almost a side feature,"" she explains. ""Your smart phone is your entertainment centre, your news generator, your navigation system, your diary, your dictionary, and your wallet.""  She adds that smartphones always ""want to grab your attention"" with notifications, updates, and breaking news constantly disrupting your day. ""This can keep you on edge, might even be agitating. It can be overwhelming."" Prof Wachter adds: ""It makes sense that some of us are now looking for simpler technologies and think that dumbphones might offer a return to simpler times. It might leave more time to fully concentrate on a single task and engage with it more purposefully. It might even calm people down. Studies have shown that too much choice can create unhappiness and agitation."" Yet back in London, Robin West says that many people are bewildered by her choice of mobile. ""Everyone thinks it's just a temporary thing. They're like: 'So when are you getting a smartphone? Are you getting one this week?'.""

Oscars 2022: Five ways the Academy is trying to stay relevant,2022-03-21T00:05:54.000Z,"The 94th Academy Awards take place this Sunday. But with last year's viewing figures at an all-time low, organisers are under pressure to make the ceremony relevant again, particularly to younger audiences. There used to be a hundred reasons to sit down and watch the Oscars. In a pre-social media age, it provided a rare opportunity to glimpse the world's biggest film stars gathered in the same place; to see what they were wearing and (for masochists) to hear their speeches. Secondly, it was a place to catch clips of the year's most acclaimed films, long before YouTube made trailers available on demand. And thirdly, there quite frankly wasn't much else to do. The highest-rating Oscars aired at a time when linear television was dominant, and there weren't as many channels to watch. But in an era of TikTok, YouTube and streaming, the biggest showbiz night of the year has been losing viewers and, with them, its power. ""The biggest challenge is getting people to watch,"" ceremony producer Will Packer told Little Gold Men. ""What that means is there's got to be something different about the show this year that connects with people outside of Hollywood. You've got to connect with the casual movie fan."" It is a delicate balance trying to keep the ratings high while simultaneously preserving everything that makes the Oscars sacred and prestigious. Here are five ways the Academy is hoping to capture audiences this year. Much to the Academy's relief, there are some proper movie stars in the running for the big prizes this year. Will Smith, who has never won an Oscar, is the firm favourite to win best actor for his performance in King Richard - where he plays the determined father of a young Venus and Serena Williams. As early as September 2021, Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson said: ""I don't see anyone beating him. It feels like the timing is right, the movie is right, the subject matter is right, and the kind of performance is right. It's playful but also serious, and we know the Academy likes actors playing a real-life person."" Rewarding Smith, he noted, would also be making a statement - that after two years of cinemas being closed due to lockdowns, movies, and movie stars, are back. Nicole Kidman, Olivia Colman, Jessica Chastain, Penelope Cruz and Kristen Stewart's nominations make the best actress category similarly starry. However, there less of a consensus about who will triumph here.  The frontrunner has changed several times, but Chastain is the current favourite, following her recent recognition from the Screen Actors Guild and the Critics' Choice awards. The Academy has also lined up a plethora of big names to present the awards, including Lady Gaga, Shang-Chi star Simu Liu, The Batman's Zoe Kravitz and Ukraine-born actress Mila Kunis. The Oscars have not had a presenter since 2018, arguably missing an opportunity for jokes, monologues and sketches to go viral and grab headlines - a strategy which has worked well for the Golden Globes. Sadly, getting an A-lister proved challenging, partly due to scheduling conflicts, partly because many big names would presumably run a mile given the potential pitfalls involved (the memory of James Franco and Anne Hathaway's disastrous stint in 2011 still looms large). The Academy has instead settled on Amy Schumer, who was big in 2015, alongside actress Regina Hall and comedian Wanda Sykes - who are both well-respected but not exactly huge international names. However, Schumer has recently indicated she might be taking a leaf out of the Globes' playbook, and using the opportunity to poke fun at the stars in the room (an approach we warmly support).  ""I'm going to get myself in some trouble,"" she told Extra earlier this month. ""Wanda, Regina are hilarious, and we're having a blast preparing.  ""I mean, I don't know who made the decision to let me personally be a host, but it's not a good oneâ¦ because it'll burn all bridges. I'll burn every bridge."" Perhaps the most interesting new addition this year is the fan favourite prize - an attempt to recognise more mainstream films during the ceremony. Without it, The Academy would have been acutely aware that they had not nominated 2021's biggest box office successes, including Spider-Man: No Way Home and No Time To Die, in the major categories. Meryl Johnson, the Academy's vice president of digital marketing, said the introduction of fan favourite would ""help build an engaged and excited digital audience leading up to this year's ceremony"", and voting was opened to the public for two weeks. However, people could vote up to 20 times a day, which meant the voting process was liable to manipulation by organised and mobilised fan bases. Which is exactly what happened. Although Spider-Man still has a good shot, the Camila Cabello-starring Cinderella musical and the arthouse Johnny Depp film Minamata could bizarrely (and hilariously) end up being recognised at the Oscars instead. We'll have more on the new fan favourite category later this week. Eight of the 23 awards this year will be pre-recorded in an effort to save time during the telecast. While the big awards will still be live, the so-called ""below-the-line"" categories like best editing, sound and production design will have been presented earlier. That means the nominees in the technical categories will be seated a full hour before the main ceremony begins. Their awards will be presented off-air, and highlights will then be edited into the TV broadcast.  ""We must prioritise the television audience to increase viewer engagement and keep the show vital, kinetic, and relevant,"" Academy president David Rubin wrote in a letter to members last month. But there has been resistance to the idea from big figures within the industry. ""I feel very strongly that this is perhaps the most collaborative medium in the world,"" West Side Story director Steven Spielberg told Deadline. ""All of us make movies together, we become a family where one craft is just as indispensable as the next. ""I feel that at the Academy Awards there is no above-the-line, there is no below-the-line. All of us are on the same line bringing the best of us to tell the best stories we possibly can."" In 2019, the Oscars reversed their decision to present awards during the commercials after significant industry backlash. This time they're standing firm, but unlike the commercials idea, the tech winners will at least still feature in the main ceremony. You couldn't hold the Oscars without acknowledging that one of the biggest worldwide chart hits of the past year was from a movie soundtrack. So the Academy is going all in, announcing that the cast of Encanto will perform the smash We Don't Talk About Bruno live for the first time during the ceremony. We'll gloss over the fact that an entirely different track from Encanto is the one actually nominated for best original song because we can't wait to see how complex, overlapping salsa melodies of Bruno might be performed live. In the film, it's performed by more than 10 characters, so it could be a complicated one to stage. The conversation about how to arrest the decline in viewing figures rolls around like clockwork every year. The lower the ratings get, the louder the cries for changes become. Last year's Oscars attracted their worst-ever TV audience, with just 10.4 million viewers tuning in. However, the subdued 2021 ceremony was unusual - taking place during worldwide lockdowns after a year that saw few major film releases - so it's an unreliable benchmark.  This year, Covid restrictions have eased and the ceremony is returning to normal, so the Academy is pulling out all the stops in an effort to make sure the viewing figures rebound to pre-pandemic levels  - equalling or bettering 2020's figure of 23.6 million.  But some have questioned whether staying relevant to a mass audience is even necessary. ""I don't get why movie people care so much if other people care what awards we give ourselves,"" actor Seth Rogen told Insider. ""I don't care who wins the automobile awards. ""No other industry expects everyone to care about what awards they shower upon themselves. Maybe people just don't care. Maybe they did for a while and they stopped caring. And why should they?"" Some former Oscar winners aren't even bothered about attending. ""I won't be going this year. To be honest, they're actually really boring,"" Don't Look Up star Sir Mark Rylance told the Radio Times this month. ""I don't think awards are a serious marker of what the greatest or most inspiring things are, but it's nice to be celebrated."" The Oscars take place on Sunday 27 March."
Loan sharks trap poorest as cost of living crisis bites,2022-03-21T00:40:43.000Z,"With price increases on everything from fuel to food making it increasingly tough for households to make ends meet, unlicensed lenders are stepping in, offering loans to the desperate at astronomical interest rates.  ""It's just endless,"" one victim told the BBC.  Small loans from the local money lender to repair the car or afford Christmas were a fact of life for her family - but ""it just spirals"", said Kim, who asked the BBC not to use her real name. ""It becomes stressful. You know you work hard for that money and you're paying these huge amounts back when you might have only had a small loan, but you know you're paying double back to them.""  At one point, Kim and her partner, who live in north-west England, had four loans from the same unlicensed lender and were paying more than half of their net income in interest.  The lender would turn up at the house at 07:30 when the children were still in bed. There were constant messages on social media, the lender knew when payday was, and Kim feared she would pursue her at her workplace.  'I went from a Â£150 loan to owing Â£6,000 in months'Snapchat loan shark who threatened victims jailed With people unwilling to talk about debt, there is little data about unlicensed lenders - but the right-leaning think-tank, the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), last year commissioned research from the Opinium polling company. Researchers questioned a representative sample of 3,363 people in England. Of these, 81 (about one in 40) were at the time borrowing from unlicensed lenders. Matthew Greenwood, CSJ's acting head of debt, told the BBC the implications of the research are huge: ""We think there are about a million people in England borrowing from an illegal lender at the moment. Overwhelmingly, people borrow when they're desperate.  ""They borrow to fund everyday costs of living, such as a gas bill or electric bill, things as small as a pram, and then they get exploited by those people who seek to extort them for as much money as they can get out of them, offering arbitrary terms, little to no paperwork and an extortionate rate of repayment."" The CSJ report highlights separate data from 1,252 victims, questioned last year by the Illegal Money Lending Team, which prosecutes loan sharks in England. The figures suggest the borrowers are often among the poorest in society:  62% had an income below Â£20,000 - and of these about half were on less than Â£15,00066% already owed money to legal creditors75% claimed benefits65% had a long-term health condition The report highlights more figures from the Illegal Money Lending Team, which show in the last six years just 327 loan sharks have been arrested.  The BBC filmed with the team during a raid on a house in north-west England last week. There was one arrest and the property was searched.  ""We are very concerned that we may see an increase with the pressures of the rising cost of living,"" said lead investigator Tony Quigley. ""But what I would say to people is that no matter how difficult it is, please don't use a local moneylender, because it really is jumping out of the frying pan into the fire."" As in Kim's case, he says it's common for debts of a few hundred pounds to spiral into thousands when lenders apply excessive interest. Threats can turn into real violence in some cases, he says: ""We've seen loan sharks that have kidnapped individuals and we've even seen loan sharks go as far as rape."" His colleague Cath Williams says the effect on victims of spiralling debt, along with manipulation and bullying from lenders, can be traumatic. ""People do get to the depths of despair where they think there's no way out and unfortunately, we have seen people where they have actually tried to take their own life.""  Loan sharks have long operated on housing estates in poorer areas, but increasingly use social media to drum up business and threaten clients, says Ms Williams: ""It means a loan shark based in Rotherham can lend money in Dorset and London and Norfolk, and those victims are never going to meet up and have a conversation and realise what's going on...it makes people even more isolated.""  The CSJ wants the Illegal Money Lending Team scaled up, with its funding at least doubled in order to investigate and prosecute loan sharks more effectively - currently it has a staff of 50 and an annual budget of Â£6.5m. Other recommendations include:  more custodial sentences for those convicted of illegal lendinga national advertising campaign and better financial education on the dangers of loan sharksefforts to boost non-profit-making credit unions which provide savings and loans to members For Kim, things came to a head one Christmas when she asked to delay the next payment so she could afford gifts for her children. When the lender refused, Kim was desperate and tried to contact ""head office"" but found no record of a loan company which she had been led to believe was legitimate.  Finally, she went to the authorities, the lender was arrested and the family received proper advice on managing their debts.  ""I'm very lucky now that as a family we have moved forward from it with a lot of help,"" she says. Kim feels guilty that her daughter still remembers times when the family were harassed for money. ""But on the other side of it, I think it's a learning curve. I can speak to other people about it and say there is help out there.""

The hunt for Nigerians who can change into cats,2022-03-21T00:14:31.000Z,"Armed with a sharp knife, a megaphone and dressed all in black, Gbenga Adewoyin could have passed for a medieval witch hunter, a herbal salesman or an urban preacher as he walked around a market in the south-western Nigerian city of Ibadan.  Warning: This article contains details that might be offensive to some readers Those curious enough to get close in the Gbagi market quickly dispersed when they heard his message. ""Anyone that can provide any evidence for the existence of the supernatural, be it juju or voodoo magic, will be offered 2.5m naira ($6,000, Â£4,650),"" he announced repeatedly in Yoruba and English. The 24-year-old atheist has recently emerged as a rebel publicly contesting the powers of the supernatural in this deeply religious country.  Belief in African traditional religions and its juju components are widespread in Nigeria, with many combining them with either Christianity or Islam, according to a 2010 report by the Pew Research Centre.  Many Nigerians believe that magic charms can allow humans to morph into cats, protect bare skins from sharp blades and make money appear in a clay pot. These beliefs are not just held by the uneducated, they exist even at the highest level of Nigeria's academia. Dr Olaleye Kayode, a senior lecturer in African Indigenous Religions at the University of Ibadan, told the BBC that money-making juju rituals - where human body parts mixed with charms makes money spew out of a pot - really work. The naira notes that supposedly appear ""are gotten by spirits from existing banks"", he told the BBC. Jude Akanbi, a lecturer at the Crowther Graduate Theological Seminary in Abáº¹ÌÃ²kÃºta, is also unequivocal about juju. ""This ability to be able to transform yourself to [a] cat, to disappear and reappear, these things are possible within the dynamics of traditional African religion.  ""Although [it] sounds illogical, like old wives' tales, however from what we have seen and heard, these things are possible,"" he said.  Such beliefs, especially that human body parts and charms can produce money from a clay pot, have led to a recent wave of gruesome murders in the country, with single women often the victims. ""I feel horrible to see young people engage in these ritual killings.  ""If money ritual worked, we would have seen a massive inflation in the economy for the decades that we have believed in it,"" Mr Adewoyin told the BBC. He was in Ibadan, Oyo state, on the second of three planned in-country tours offering 2.5m naira, crowd-funded via Twitter, to anyone that can publicly demonstrate these juju powers. ""The knife is for anyone that claims their juju makes them blade-proof,"" he said. Questioning the existence of supernatural powers is considered taboo in much of Nigerian society.  To be openly expressing such thoughts, as Mr Adewoyin was doing in a market, was risky. He could just as easily be arrested for blasphemy or lynched by an angry mob. ""Of course juju works, he doesn't know what he is saying,"" said one trader who lingered with a scowl on his face. In his pocket was a black amulet, a small leather pouch containing supposedly magic charms, that he said was for protection. However, he was not interested in publicly demonstrating its powers, not even for $6,000. Belief in magic often coexists with Christianity and Islam. Clerics from both monotheistic religions often refer to aspects of traditional African religions as evil - something real, but which can be defeated by prayer and their own higher powers. Many pastors have become rich and famous on claims of having supernatural powers that can overcome juju and evil curses, something which many imams also practise. However, no-one has taken up Mr Adewoyin's challenge at two of the venues in Ogun and Ibadan and he is not holding his breath for his next stop in Anambra state in the south-east. While he has been dismissed by some as an attention seeker, no-one can hide from the grisly images of the bodies found recently with missing limbs and empty eye sockets in a resurgence of the sinister money-making juju rituals. This killing of humans to use their body parts for magic purposes gripped Nigeria in the mid-90s and led to riots in the eastern city of Owerri after the kidnap and murder of an 11-year-old boy in 1996. Now, with social media, hardly a day passes without reports of a missing person and pictures of mutilated corpses linked to juju. There was widespread outrage last month after three men allegedly killed a 17-year-old girl in Ogun state to use her body parts in a ritual they believed would make them rich. They confessed to the killing after they were arrested by the police and have been charged in court. The clay pot and red cloths they were caught with could have passed for a scene in a movie from Nollywood, Nigeria's film industry famous for depicting manifestations of juju, but this was real. And they were young men - the oldest was 21, sparking the Twitter hashtag #At21, where users described what they were doing at that stage in life and bemoaning what they saw as societal pressures on young people to get rich quick. The outrage over the girl's death made federal lawmakers debate juju in parliament and consider the ""declaration of a state of emergency on ritual killings in the country"", with its depiction in Nollywood movies mentioned as a factor.  Nigeria's Information Minister Lai Mohammed has also chipped in, blaming Nigerian movies and social media for the spate of killings. He wants the films censor board to engage film makers ""on the need to eschew money ritual content in their movies"". But film makers are not having it - they feel he has unduly picked on Nollywood in what is a national crisis. ""The minister misfired, he cannot breach our fundamental rights to create,"" actor and producer Kanayo O Kanayo told the BBC. He said the minister was neglecting what has become a societal issue and the inability of families, traditional and religious leaders, and politicians to ensure the moral upbringing of young people. While the debate rages about who is to blame for the killings, a much broader conversation is to be had about Nigeria's educational system that fails to persuade people that juju and the supernatural are not real, says Mr Adewoyin. He is hoping that his rebellious tour can expose those he calls tricksters, claiming the supernatural powers of juju, and help put an end to the spate of ritual killings. ""For a reasonable human being to believe that a human with all his biological components can turn to yam or banana is illogical, and worrisome,"" he said."
Covid: Five things we still need to keep an eye on,2022-02-26T00:50:33.000Z,"The legal restrictions that ruled our lives for two long years are gone in England and on their way out across the UK. We've moved from being ""under the thumb"" of Covid to ""living with"" the virus.  However, the pandemic is far from over - Covid is here for the long term and some scientists think we are relaxing too early.  So what do we need to keep an eye out for in the months and years ahead?  What's the issue? We've already had the original virus, then the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants causing significant waves of Covid in the UK. It is simply inevitable that the virus will continue to mutate and create new variants in the future.  Why is it important? New variants aren't necessarily a problem and we shouldn't panic at every new mutation. It is important to remember we have a significant wall of immunity that should continue to provide protection even against new variants. The vaccines that were developed against the first form of the virus are still saving lives from the latest variant, Omicron. However, it is possible that new variants could significantly change the behaviour of the virus to make it more deadly, spread far more quickly or bypass the protection from either vaccination or previous infection. All of these could make Covid an even greater threat than it is today.  What can we do about it? There are two approaches: minimise mutations or react when a new variant emerges. There is a risk of mutations every time the virus makes copies of itself so the only way to reduce the risk of variants is to minimise infections at a global level. Instead, the emphasis seems to be on monitoring new variants and reacting accordingly, such as updating vaccines.  What's the issue? It has become abundantly clear that immunity wanes over time. People are catching Covid even if they have been triple-jabbed or have caught Covid before. The protection against catching the virus wanes quite quickly, but protection against getting seriously ill or dying is lasting much longer.  Why is it important? Immunity is the only reason we have been able to relax restrictions. Two years ago our bodies were fighting the virus blind, but now our immune systems have been trained. This level of immunity is the main reason the infection is now less deadly. However, significant waning of immunity could lead to new waves of Covid and even renewed pressure on hospitals. It is possible we will have a ""honeymoon period"" where it looks like Covid is in total retreat, only for it to bounce back once enough immunity wanes.  What can we do about it? The amount of protection we have against the virus will need to be constantly monitored. Immediately, this will dictate who gets further vaccine doses and how often. There are already plans to give another booster this spring to the over-75s and people at high risk from the virus. There will be a wider booster campaign in anticipation of next winter, too. In the longer term there is already work under way on a next generation of Covid vaccine to see whether it can provide longer-term protection.  Covid vaccine âwaning immunityâ: How worried should I be? What's the issue? Drugs that kill the virus are now being used to keep people out of hospital, but there is a danger that if we use them badly, the virus will evolve to render the drugs ineffective.  Why is it important? Some scientists think this is the single most important issue in the months ahead. We are familiar with hard-to-treat superbugs, from MRSA to super-gonorrhoea, which were created by misusing antibiotics. The same process can happen with antivirals. These drugs, such as Paxlovid and molnupiravir, are currently playing a vital role in saving lives and are one reason restrictions are being eased. Even more importantly, they are the safety net in the future. If a new variant emerges that significantly bypasses our immunity, we will be dependent on antivirals to buy us time until an updated vaccine can be developed and rolled out.  What can we do about it? The more you use antivirals the greater the risk of resistance, which means they will need to be used carefully in the people with the most to gain from them. This could lead to difficult decisions around treating a patient today and preserving them for the patients of the future. One solution is using several antivirals in combination, which greatly reduces the risk of the virus becoming resistant.   What's the issue? Life is still far from normal and nobody knows for sure how we are all going to react to the changes in restrictions and testing. This creates huge uncertainty in the weeks and months to come.  Why is it important? It is obvious, but Covid is spread from one person to another - the more we congregate together, the greater the opportunities for the virus. So what happens now? Will we all return to our workplace or is home-working the norm now? Will we buy tests when they used to be free? If we get ill, will we isolate or crack on as soon as we feel okay even if we may still be contagious? What will vulnerable people who used to shield do now? How long will people keep on wearing face masks in crowded places? The impact of our shifting behaviour is likely to be greater than any seasonal impact on the virus. The uncertainty means we could continue to have declining infections and people in hospital or it could swing into reverse. However, high levels of immunity mean overwhelming pressure on the NHS is highly unlikely. What can we do about it? Very little. The decisions have now been made. Legal rules have been replaced with advice on what to do in the future. England's chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, says people should continue isolating if they test positive, even though there is no legal requirement to do so. What's the issue? Not everyone rapidly recovers from an infection and some develop ""long Covid"". Further infections could increase the numbers with long Covid. Why is it important? Long Covid can be utterly debilitating. Persistent fatigue is common in long Covid, along with brain fog, shortness of breath and muscle pain. More than one in 50 people in the UK say they have long Covid and more than half a million have symptoms that have already lasted more than a year. It is not clear what will happen in the future - is long Covid just a feature of this virus and will always happen, or will it fade away as our immunity improves? Studies have suggested vaccination reduces the risk of long Covid, but does not eliminate it. What can we do about it? The number of cases of long Covid will need to be monitored. Understanding why the virus causes long Covid and what the best treatments are could speed up people's recovery.  Follow James on Twitter "

Anger and grief as crowds rally to support Child Q,2022-03-21T03:48:48.000Z,"Let black girls be girls. That was the message that hundreds of people wanted to express when they gathered for a rally in north London on Sunday. Crowds marched in support of Child Q - a black 15-year-old girl who was strip-searched at school after being wrongly suspected of carrying drugs. The incident happened in 2020 and the girl's family is suing her school and the force. The family said the girl had become ""a shell of her former bubbly self"". But it has reignited concerns over the treatment of black people by the Metropolitan Police. The Met has apologised for what happened but people at the rally say they want assurances that what happened to Child Q won't be repeated. Holding banners and chanting, people demanded justice. One placard read ""protect our black children"". But aside from the anger and outrage, the sense of grief and trauma was palpable. Many shed tears in the midst of chanting for change. Omega Douglas said she felt sick when she heard what happened to Child Q. She came along to the rally with her mother and daughter. Like many, she believes the Met has failed black people several times. ""I'm old enough to have lived through the Brixton riots,"" she said, citing the ""multiple abuses of power by the police in this country"". She added: ""I am appalled."" Jacqui Courtenay set up the rally after hearing about the case of Child Q a few days ago. She said she had a strong urge to act because ""a child out there has been caused such harm, a black child, and that could have been my kids... that could be [my] nieces and nephews"". Jacqui and several others say they felt particularly traumatised after hearing how the 15-year-old was strip searched by two female police officers, and made to take off her sanitary towel. The teenager was on her period at the time. The ordeal took place at Child Q's school, with no appropriate adult present. It's the first time that Jacqui, a city worker, has set up an event of this kind. She reached out to Patrick Vernon, a Windrush campaigner who helped organise the rally with the support of other human rights activists like Marai Larasi. Jacqui said she was overwhelmed by the response of the hundreds of people who came to the rally in solidarity with Child Q. ""I feel like it's an out of body experience... It's been so long since we've seen such an outpouring of love for a black person, let alone a black girl."" Many people told the BBC of their anger at the ""adultification bias"" which the safeguarding review said was highly likely to have been a factor in the case. Adultification is a form of racial prejudice that causes adults to perceive black children as being older than they are. ""They are seen as troublemakers"" said Izzy, a youth worker at the rally. ""They're seen as aggressive or loud, a threat. I get them telling me about that quite a lot."" Speaking through her tears, Holly Adamoh said that the school involved should have looked after Child Q. ""You should not have to feel racially profiled within a school, and you shouldn't have to ever feel threatened,"" she said. ""You should be listened to and looked after."" Frustrated, Holly said she believed the police showed a lack of empathy towards Child Q. Former Met Police superintendent Leroy Logan was also at the rally. He retired in 2013 but spent some of his career in Hackney, where the incident took place. He told the BBC that the false accusation made about Child Q smelling of cannabis did not give the police the authority to carry out the strip search.  The Met Police has apologised, with Scotland Yard saying its officers' actions were ""regrettable"" and ""it should never have happened"". Last month, a senior Met officer told the BBC that racism remains a problem in the force - but he denied the Met was a racist organisation. Logan added that many people are disgusted by the case and ""know their child could be next"". ""This is not a time just to say we regret,"" he said. ""There has to be action."""
China Eastern: Plane carrying 132 people crashes in Guangxi hills,2022-03-21T16:58:01.000Z,"A Chinese passenger plane with 132 people on board has crashed in a forested hillside in southern China. The China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it plunged to earth in Guangxi province and caught fire. The number of casualties and reason for the crash are not yet known. Rescuers have seen no signs of survivors. Chinese airlines generally have a good safety record - the last major accident took place 12 years ago. The crash has caused shock in China, where President Xi Jinping has ordered an immediate investigation to determine the cause. China Eastern Airlines has grounded all its 737-800s. Flight tracking data suggested the plane lost height rapidly from its cruising altitude before plummeting to the ground. More than 600 emergency responders are said to be at the crash site. Firefighters reached the scene first and managed to extinguish a blaze in the hills caused by the crash. Footage taken by local villagers and shared on Chinese social media - and by state broadcasters - showed fire and smoke from the crash, with plane debris on the ground. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Air safety and aviation standards in China have improved vastly in recent decades, following a series of accidents in the 1990s, and crashes such as this are now very rare. The country's last major plane accident was in August 2010, when a flight from Harbin crashed in north-east Yichun during foggy weather, killing 42 people. Air disasters timeline China Eastern has set up a hotline for people seeking information about those on board. It expressed ""its deep condolences for the passengers and crew members who died"".  Earlier, it greyed out its logo on its Weibo account and also changed its website to black and white in an apparent sign of mourning. As a precaution, China Eastern's entire fleet of Boeing 737-800 jets has been grounded. It took just two and a half minutes for an apparently normal flight to turn into a tragedy. The aircraft was a 737-800, a well-proven design first produced in the late 1990s. It is a workhorse of the aviation world, with thousands still in service.  It has a strong safety record. Fatigue cracks have been found in some older planes, but this one was not quite seven years old. There is no connection here with the 737 MAX, a newer version of the 737, which was grounded for more than a year and a half after a design flaw triggered two major accidents. Investigators will be looking at many possible causes - among them deliberate action, such as terrorism, technical issues such as structural failure, or a mid-air collision. They will look at communications from the pilots, examine the state of the wreckage - and search for the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. Those recorders should contain the information needed to confirm exactly what happened during those minutes and why. Staff at Guangzhou airport are directing worried relatives to a separate zone set up to receive them.  One woman waiting for news there told local media she had booked a seat on the flight, but ended up switching to an earlier plane. ""I feel very sad,"" she said. Her sister and four friends were on the crashed plane, AFP news agency reports. State-owned China Eastern is one of China's big three airlines, along with China Southern and Air China. Flight MU5735 left Kunming at 13:11 local time (05:11 GMT) and was scheduled to arrive in Guangzhou at 15:05. Flight tracking sites report the plane was in the air for just over an hour and was nearing its destination when it went down in Wuzhou, a verdant, hilly area prone to mixed weather at this time of year as China enters its annual flood season.  The weather was cloudy, but visibility was reported to have been good at the time of the crash. Footage said to be of Flight MU5735 plummeting vertically from the sky has been circulating on social media. The plane dropped thousands of metres in three minutes, flight tracker data showed. According to FlightRadar24 data, the plane was cruising at 29,100ft, but two minutes and 15 seconds later it was recorded at 9,075ft. The last sourced information on the flight showed it ended at 14:22 local time, at an altitude of 3,225ft.  ""Usually the plane is on autopilot during cruise stage. So it is very hard to fathom what happened,"" Li Xiaojin, a Chinese aviation expert, told Reuters news agency. Another expert, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge, told China's Global Times newspaper: ""It is very likely that the aircraft lost power at cruising altitude, resulting in the pilot losing control of the aircraft.  ""This is a very serious technical failure in which the plane inevitably enters a high-speed descent."" The Boeing 737-800 plane was nearly seven years old, according to tracker websites. It is the predecessor model to the Boeing 737 Max line, which were the planes involved in deadly crashes in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019. China banned that model after those crashes. Boeing issued a statement on the crash of MU5735, saying: ""We are aware of the initial media reports and are working to gather more information."" China's Civil Aviation Administration said it had dispatched its investigators to the scene. "
Sabita Thanwani killing: Family pay tribute to 'irreplaceable angel',2022-03-21T10:34:22.000Z,"The family of a 19-year-old woman found dead in student accommodation have paid tribute to their ""beautiful, irreplaceable angel"". Student Sabita Thanwani was found with neck injuries in the halls of residence in Sebastian Street, Clerkenwell. Police and medics went to Arbour House at about 05:10 GMT on Saturday but she died at the scene. Police have arrested Maher Maaroufe, 22, on suspicion of murdering Ms Thanwani. He remains in police custody.  In a statement, Ms Thanwani's family said: ""Sabita was our daughter. Our angel.  ""Her life, that we hoped would be long, was cut tragically short. She was ripped away from those who loved her so very dearly; her mum, dad, brother, grandparents, extended family and friends. ""We can only pray that lessons will be learnt and that somehow, there will come a day when girls and women are safe.  ""Sabita was the most caring and loving person we have ever known. She inspired us every day of her precious 19 years of life. Her mission was to help everyone. ""Her whole life was ahead of her, a life where her radiant smile and incredible heart could only spread warmth and kindness. ""In her short life, she helped so many. Sabita was pure and did not see bad in anyone, because there was no badness in her own awesome heart.  ""We will never ever stop loving or missing our beautiful, irreplaceable Sabita. The girl that was an angel upon the earth is now an angel in heaven."" Ms Thanwani was studying psychology at City, University of London, which is near to the student accommodation where she died.  Mr Maaroufe was arrested by officers in Clerkenwell area after a police appeal to trace him. He had been in a relationship with Ms Thanwani at the time of her death, police said. A post-mortem examination has also been arranged."
Climate change: 'Madness' to turn to fossil fuels because of Ukraine war,2022-03-21T09:33:35.000Z,"The UN Secretary General says the rush to use fossil fuels because of the war in Ukraine is ""madness"" and threatens global climate targets.  The invasion of Ukraine has seen rapid rises in the prices of coal, oil and gas as countries scramble to replace Russian sources.  But Antonio Guterres warns that these short-term measures might ""close the window"" on the Paris climate goals.  He also calls on countries, including China, to fully phase out coal by 2040. UN climate panel to examine carbon removalEU unveils plan to end reliance on Russian gasCan the energy crisis help the climate? In his first major speech on climate and energy since COP26, Mr Guterres makes no bones about the fact that the limited progress achieved in Glasgow is insufficient to ward off dangerous climate change. Scientists believe that keeping the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century is crucial to limiting the scale of damage from global warming. To keep that threshold alive, carbon output needs to be cut in half by the end of this decade.  Instead, as Mr Guterres points out, emissions are set to rise by 14%. ""The problem was not solved in Glasgow,"" Mr Guterres says, in a speech delivered at the Economist Sustainability Summit. ""In fact, the problem is getting worse."" The war in Ukraine threatens to make that situation even more problematic, he says.  A really simple guide to climate change   Europe and the UK and other countries are looking to cut their reliance on Russian oil and gas this year. Many are turning to coal or imports of liquefied natural gas as alternative sources.  But Mr Guterres warns this short-term approach heralds great danger for the climate. ""Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use,"" Mr Guterres said. ""This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction."" Countries must ""accelerate the phase out of coal and all fossil fuels,"" and implement a rapid and sustainable energy transition.  It is ""the only true pathway to energy security."" Mr Guterres says the solutions to the climate crisis mostly lie in the hands of the G20 group of richest nations, which produce around 80% of global emissions.  While many of these countries have taken great steps to slash emissions by 2030, there are a ""handful of holdouts, such as Australia."" Coal must be banished, Mr Guterres says, with a full phase-out for richer nations by 2030, and 2040 for all others, including China. Coal ""is a stupid investment,"" according to the Secretary General, ""leading to billions in stranded assets."" He says the way forward is to build coalitions to help major emerging economies to move rapidly away from fossil fuels.  He highlights the case of South Africa. During COP26 several countries including the UK, US and others agreed to an $8.5bn financing programme to end South Africa's reliance on coal.  Mr Guterres says the pieces are coming together for similar coalitions in Indonesia, Vietnam and elsewhere.  Money is one of the key problems in addressing the climate issue and Mr Guterres has called for a major ramping up in finance to help countries adapt to rising temperatures.  He points out that right now, one person in three globally is not covered by early warning systems for disasters - in Africa six in ten people are not protected.  In 2022, he argues, richer countries must finally make good on their well-worn promise to provide a $100bn a year to the developing world. Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
Free-range eggs no longer available in UK due to bird flu,2022-03-21T16:45:28.000Z,"People can no longer buy free-range eggs in the UK due to the length of time hens have been kept indoors following outbreaks of bird flu. The eggs in shops will be labelled as ""barn eggs"" due to birds being kept inside for more than 16 weeks. The country is experiencing its largest ever outbreak of avian influenza and measures are in place to prevent the virus from spreading. About 55% of all eggs produced in the UK are free-range, says the RSPCA. It means they come from birds that, during the daytime, enjoy unlimited access to outdoor pastures.  Signs will be put in supermarkets to inform shoppers of the change from Monday, and free-range labelling will only return when hens are permitted to go outside again. Human case of bird flu detected in the UKBirds culled amid multiple outbreaks of avian flu Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser at the National Farmers' Union, said the government's advice was that there was ""still a high level of risk"" to birds of catching flu. ""This is an incredibly difficult time for all bird owners and vigilance remains vital,"" she added.  Ms Mahony said farmers were following ""stringent biosecurity measures"" and adapting hen houses to make birds more comfortable. Both ""barn"" and ""free range"" eggs meet the RSPCA's welfare standards, because the hens that lay them have freedom and space to move around, along with perches for roosting and nest boxes. The difference is that for barn hens, this all happens inside, whereas free-range hens can access to the outside through ""popholes"" - although bird flu restrictions have put a stop to this. The RSPCA says consumers buy more boxes of free range and barn eggs than those from caged hens. However, the charity says a large proportion of eggs used as ingredients in products like mayonnaise, cakes and sandwiches are still from hens kept in cages. It says such cages provide less than the size of an A4 piece of paper of space per bird and have limited facilities for perching, nesting and scratching and do not meet its welfare standards.  The charity says about 35% of egg-laying hens are still kept in cages. Case numbers of the H5N1 strain of bird flu began rising in November last year. The virus - which is highly contagious and can destroy poultry flocks - was first discovered in North Yorkshire. It poses an extremely low risk to humans, according to the NHS, although several people have been infected around the world and a number have died. The outbreaks have resulted in the government enforcing an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone which made it a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK - whether they have pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard flock - to keep them indoors and follow strict biosecurity measures. Under such restrictions egg farmers have a 16-week ""grace period"" to maintain their free-range status, but this ended on Monday. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, assistant director of food at the British Retail Consortium, said shops and supermarkets would ""continue to support British farmers"". In a statement the government said it would work with farmers and retailers to implement the branding changings. A spokesman added: ""We are experiencing our largest ever outbreak of avian flu and housing measures remain in force to protect poultry and other birds from this highly infectious and unpleasant disease."""

Ukraine conflict: Russian shelling blamed for corrosive gas leak,2022-03-21T07:45:55.000Z,"Russian shells hit a chemical plant near the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, causing an ammonia leak, officials say.  Residents of Novoselytsya, near Sumy, were told to stay indoors but the region's governor, Dmytro Zhyvytskyy, later said the leak had been contained.  A 50-ton tank of the poison gas was damaged by the attack, local officials said, creating an ammonia cloud. Ammonia is largely used to make fertiliser and is corrosive.  The Sumykhimprom chemical plant was attended by emergency crews, and the cloud affected an area of about 2.5km (1.5 miles), Dmytro Zhyvytsky said.  He said one injury was reported - a worker at the plant. Residents of Novoselytsya were advised to shelter because of the wind direction. Could Russia use chemical weapons in Ukraine?Fact-checking Russia's biological weapons claimsRussia could launch chemical attack - White House  Ammonia is a common chemical that has several commercial uses, and the Sumykhimprom plant says its production is for making chemical fertiliser. It is a waste product of the human body and usually dealt with by the liver, but is toxic in large amounts.  In the air, it is invisible but has a distinct unpleasant smell, and in high concentrations is both and irritant and corrosive. It can cause pain and burns to the airway and injuries to the eyes. However, it is lighter than air, so does not remain on the ground as long as some other dangerous gases do. Russia has previously alleged, without any evidence, that Ukraine was planning to use chemical weapons in the ongoing war, pointing to the creation of industrial chemicals such as ammonia.  Earlier this month, Russia's defence ministry alleged that Ukraine was plotting a ""false flag"" operation to blame Russia for using chemical weapons. Yet Ukraine and its Western allies, including the US, have ridiculed such claims, and expressed their own concerns that Russia was setting the stage for its own false flag chemical weapons attack, which it would attempt to pin on Ukraine. Ammonia is not well-known as a chemical weapon, since the human body has ways of processing it and it disperses, being lighter than air."
Woman accused of murder after body find appears in court,2022-03-21T17:09:14.000Z,"A primary school teacher has appeared in court accused of murdering a man whose body was found buried in a back garden. Nicholas Billingham, 42, was found at a house in Moore Street, in the Kingsley area of Northampton, on Saturday. Fiona Beal, 48, who was arrested at a hotel in Cumbria on Wednesday, did not enter a plea at Northampton Magistrates' Court. She is accused of killing him between 30 October and 10 November last year. Wearing a grey tracksuit, Ms Beal, a teacher at Eastfield Academy primary school in Northampton, spoke quietly only to give her date of birth and her address, which is Moore Street. Mr Billingham's remains have been taken to Leicester for a forensic examination by a Home Office pathologist. They were discovered following a three-day search involving forensic officers, a specialist search team and a cadaver dog, used to locate bodies. Magistrates committed the case to Northampton Crown Court for a hearing on Tuesday. Defending, Neil Clarke made no application for bail. Ms Beal nodded when asked if she had understood the proceedings. A spokesperson for Eastfield Academy said the school had been ""shocked and saddened"" to learn Ms Beal had been charged. They added: ""We are particularly mindful of the impact this news will have on the children, and will be doing everything we can to support both pupils and staff as we work through this difficult time together.  ""This is an appalling tragedy that will shake our school community to its roots and it's at times like this that we must rally around each other, support each other, and be kind to each other.""

Covid trapped me at home for more than seven months,2022-03-21T07:30:41.000Z,"A vaccine has been used to free a man who was trapped at home by a Covid infection that lasted for more than seven months.  It is the first time that a vaccine has been used to ""treat"" Covid rather than ""prevent"" it.  Ian Lester, 37, has a weakened immune system that was unable to defeat the virus on its own.  He says he became a prisoner in his home in Caerphilly, Wales, as he isolated for months on end.  Ian was born with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which makes it harder for him to fight off infections. Even a common cold can linger.   He shielded during the first wave of Covid, but coronavirus eventually found him in December 2020. He had one of the classic symptoms - a slight loss of sense of taste and smell - which cleared up within a month.  For most of us that would be the end of it, but Ian's Covid journey was only just beginning. His doctors wanted him to keep on testing because his weakened immune system meant there was a risk he could be contagious for longer than normal. But month after month, test after test came back positive. Ian had to give up work at the opticians where he'd be in close contact with others and stay at home.  Initially he tried to make the most of it, and the Christmas tree stayed up through January, but eventually the isolation took its toll. ""People would feel like it's going to be a long holiday, but after the three-month mark it wasn't,"" Ian told me. Slowly every day began to feel the same - a pattern of cooking, TV, reading, playing guitar and just waiting for his wife Katie to get home. Ian said: ""It was like living in groundhog day, you just end up sitting there staring at the wall.  ""It slowly became my prison cell, especially when it got to the summertime and the restrictions were lifting for everyone else, you could see family and friends starting to get back to a real life, and I was still getting these positive results.""  Ian started to become ill again after the three-month mark. Fatigue, headaches, insomnia, and a tight chest all set in, he was struggling to concentrate and every three to four weeks there would be a build-up of sticky mucous on his lungs.  It was never enough to need hospital treatment, but it was clear his body wasn't easily shrugging off Covid. ""I was worried that I'd keep on getting worse and worse and worse and never get rid of it,"" he said. Scientists and doctors were monitoring the battle between the virus and Ian's immune system at Cardiff University and at the Immunodeficiency Centre for Wales in the University Hospital of Wales.  The analysis showed Ian had a long-term infection, it was not just ""dead virus"" being detected, and his symptoms were not long-Covid.   ""Ian really didn't have much of an immune response at all against the Covid virus,"" Dr Mark Ponsford, a clinician scientist at Cardiff University, told the BBC. They could not find antibodies that would stick to and neutralise the coronavirus, and there were only limited signs of T-cells, another wing of the immune system, that could attack Covid.  At the time, in the early summer of 2021, there were limited treatments, so the medical team decided to try something radical. Instead of giving a vaccine to prevent an infection, they decided to use the Pfizer vaccine to treat one.  The difference in Ian's body ""was like night and day"", says Dr Ponsford. The first dose started to build his immunity, but it took a second dose to reach the point where his body could fight off the virus.  By the end of August, Ian was testing negative again.  So why was the vaccine able to clear the infection, when months of having the virus did not build up enough immunity? Prof Stephen Jolles, clinical lead at the Immunodeficiency Centre, said: ""This infection was burbling along, but with his [weakened] immune system it was just not enough to kick off a response sufficient to clear it.  ""So the vaccine really made a huge difference, in antibodies and T-cells, and utilised and squeezed every last drop out of what his immune system could do.""  On the day Ian was finally clear of Covid he was ""ecstatic"" and says ""I couldn't believe it to tell you the truth"". He celebrated with a day on the beach and a portion of fish and chips with Katie.  ""Everything's back to normal now,"" he says. The researchers think this approach can be used in more people with weakened immune systems who are struggling to fight off the infection. There are anti-viral drugs now that were not available when Ian had Covid, but the team think vaccines could offer a cheaper and more durable option. The findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Immunology.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: I should have been freed six years ago,2022-03-21T21:12:46.000Z,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has said it should never have taken the government so long to secure her release from prison in Iran.  She told a news conference she had been overwhelmed with emotion to be reunited with her husband and daughter, describing the reunion as precious. But she said ""what's happened now should have happened six years ago"". The British-Iranian was speaking for the first time since her dramatic return to the UK last week. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested on spying charges while visiting her parents in Iran, with her then two-year-old daughter Gabriella, in April 2016. Last week, she was freed after spending six years in detention. Her release came after the UK government paid a Â£400m debt to Iran dating back to the 1970s, although both governments have said the two issues should not be linked.  Speaking to the media in Westminster, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe thanked all those who had worked to get her released, paying tribute to her ""amazing, wonderful"" husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who she said had campaigned tirelessly. She also thanked her daughter ""for being very, very patient with mummy"". But she took issue with the credit her husband had granted Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her release, saying: ""I have seen five foreign secretaries change over the course of six years. How many foreign secretaries does it take for someone to come home?""  She added: ""We all knowâ¦ how I came home. It should have happened exactly six years ago."" 'Richard showed us what love really means'British-US national held in Iran on hunger strikeWho are the dual nationals jailed in Iran? Describing her arrival back in the UK, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe recalled the ""precious"" and ""glorious"" feeling of stepping off the plane and seeing her daughter again.  ""I had been waiting for that moment for such a long time,"" she said.  ""It was lovely to get to hold her, to braid her hair and to brush her hair. That was a moment that I really, really missed."" She said she was looking forward to getting to know Gabriella better again and doing everyday things like taking her to school.  Also speaking at the news conference, Mr Ratcliffe joked that it was ""nice to be retiring"" from his role as a campaigner, and thanked everyone for ""making us whole again"". ""I'm so pleased she's back home, that she came home to us. We're still negotiating whether daddy's allowed in the same bed as Gabriella and Nazanin. We'll get there."" Mr Ratcliffe continued: ""I think we'll do this and then we will disappear off and heal a bit."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe declined to speak about her ordeal, saying it would always haunt her.  But she added: ""I always felt like I was holding this black hole in my heart all these years... I am going to leave that black hole on the plane.""  While in Iran in September 2016, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government and was given a five-year sentence. Then, in April 2021, she was sentenced for another year on charges of propaganda against the government. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has always denied those allegations and said that she was only in Iran to visit her family.  Speaking on Monday, she said she had been told by Iranian authorities shortly after her arrest that they wanted ""something off the Brits"", and that they would not let her go until they had got it.  ""And they did keep their promise,"" she said. Earlier during her visit to Westminster, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe met Speaker of the House Sir Lindsay Hoyle in his parliamentary rooms. The Speaker told her ""the whole nation rejoiced"" when she returned to the UK.  He added: ""You have achieved something that many others before you have not - in uniting the House in their efforts and hope to get you home."" Another British-Iranian national, Anoosheh Ashoori, was released at the same time as Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe.  But Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe also used the event to draw attention to the plight of other dual nationals still detained in Iran.  Morad Tahbaz, who has British, Iranian, and American citizenship, remains in detention, and there are numerous people from other countries who are being held on various allegations of working to undermine the Iranian regime. Mr Tahbaz's daughter, Roxanne, also appeared at the conference, and said her family felt her father had been ""abandoned and left behind"" in Iran. She said they had been told by the Foreign Office that Mr Tahbaz would be included in any deal to release hostages in Iran, and called on the prime minister and the foreign secretary to continue to work for his release.   ""I believe that the meaning of freedom is never going to be complete until such time that all of us who are unjustly detained in Iran are reunited with our families,"" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe said.  ""There are so many other people - we don't know their names - who have been suffering in prison."" Tulip Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, has called on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee to investigate why the debt the UK had with Iran took ""so long"" to be paid. Ms Siddiq - who represents Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's constituency and has called herself the ""Nazanin MP"" - said she had written to the chair of the committee, Tom Tugendhat.  Mr Ratcliffe welcomed the investigation and said it would be ""really valuable for Parliament to take up that challenge and to talk it through""."
Sir David Amess MP murder trial hears accused targeted Michael Gove,2022-03-21T18:30:32.000Z,"An ""Islamist terrorist"" accused of murdering Sir David Amess MP carried out reconnaissance on other potential targets including cabinet minister Michael Gove, his trial heard. Sir David, MP for Southend West, was stabbed during a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on 15 October. Ali Harbi Ali stabbed Sir David repeatedly in an ""assassination for terrorist purposes"", the jury heard. The 26-year-old from London denies murder and preparing acts of terrorism. Opening the trial at the Old Bailey in London, prosecutor Tom Little QC described the defendant as a ""radicalised Islamist terrorist"" and called it a ""murder carried out because of a warped and twisted and violent ideology"". ""This was nothing less than an assassination for terrorist purposes,"" he said. ""It is a crime to which, we say, he has no defence."" Moments before the stabbing the defendant's phone made a sound and he said ""sorry"" before repeatedly stabbing the MP, the prosecution said. A post-mortem examination showed Sir David suffered 21 stab wounds to his face, arms, legs and torso, as well as injuries to both hands that were consistent with defending himself. The court heard Mr Ali had requested an appointment with Sir David under the pretence he was moving to the area and he provided a postcode to verify this. Mr Little told jurors that Mr Ali appeared ""relaxed and chatty"" as he walked over to Sir David just before he ""brutally"" stabbed him in a ""vicious and frenzied attack"" shortly after midday on 15 October. Two people arriving for the next appointment heard cries for help from the MP's aides while Mr Ali continued to wave a bloody knife shouting ""I killed him, I killed him"", the court was told. Mr Little said the defendant then shouted to those in the church: ""I want him dead. I want every Parliament Minister [sic] who signed up for the bombing of Syria who agreed to the Iraqi war to die."" Ali Harbi Ali sat impassively in the dock of Court Two at the Old Bailey as the jury heard how he had given a clear account at the scene of the attack, why he had allegedly done it and how he would then wait for armed police to arrive and shoot him dead.  But this wasn't central London, but quiet suburban Leigh-on-Sea.   So instead, the first responders were two local officers - PCs Scott James and Ryan Curtis - and the jury watched transfixed by the body-worn video of what happened next.  Witnesses warned the officers they would be attacked if they entered. But with a Taser team still minutes away and firearms even further behind, PCs James and Curtis decide to risk their own lives in the hope of saving Sir David's.  Carrying just their batons and incapacitating spray, they enter the church, see the assailant - and then scream at him, with some choice expletives, to drop the knife.  The attacker suddenly does so and a split second later he is rushed to the ground and pinned down, cuffed and his rights are read.  There was nothing the officers could do to save Sir David.  The defendant was then heard on the phone saying: ""I've done it because of Syria. I've done it because of the innocent people. I've done it because of the bombing. He deserved to die."" During a confrontation he refused to drop his knife and said he wanted to be shot and ""I want to die; I want to be a hero"". Mr Little said that around the time of the attack, the defendant sent a long message to friends and family with a video relating to Raqqa in Syria. Instead of firearms officers Mr Ali was initially confronted by two plain clothes Essex Police officers, the court heard. Mr Little said the pair ""bravely decided"" to enter the building armed only with a baton and incapacitant spray. He added: ""The defendant hoped that he would be shot, killed, a martyr for the terrorist cause.  ""However, this was not outside the Houses of Parliament, central London, but Leigh-on-Sea and the first police attenders were not firearms officers but PC Scott James and PC Ryan Curtis."" In his police interview Mr Ali allegedly told officers how he remembered stabbing Sir David ""a few times in the places where I stabbed him"" adding: ""You don't send off a bunch of messages saying that you're committing a terror attack if you don't actually commit a terrorist attack."" Sir David, first elected as a Conservative MP in Basildon in Essex in 1983, was pronounced dead at the scene, where Mr Ali was arrested by police. Mr Little said: ""This is a case involving a cold and calculated murder, a murder carried out in a place of worship. ""It was a murder carried out by that young man [Mr Ali] who for many years had been planning just such an attack and who was, and is, a committed, fanatical, radicalised Islamist terrorist."" Mr Little said the attack was ""no spur-of-the-moment decision"", and said Mr Ali bought the knife used to attack Sir David five years earlier. He said: ""He had for a number of years been determined to carry out an act of domestic terrorism."" Mr Little said the defendant had researched a list of ""523 MPs who carried out a vote to carry out airstrikes in Syria"", using the website theyworkforus.com. He carried out reconnaissance trips including six different visits to Michael Gove's address in west London in 2021.  Evidence recovered from his phone suggested he had been on the road where the secretary of state for communities and levelling up lived, the prosecution said.  A note entitled ""plans"" from 2019, examined possible ways to attack Mr Gove including bumping into him while the MP for Surrey Heath was out jogging.  Data from the defendant's mobile phone also placed him in the proximity of the Houses of Parliament seven times between July and September 2021, the court was told. Mr Little told the jury: ""Being blunt about it, he's not a tourist... looking at Big Ben and taking some photographs. ""This is terrorist planning."" Trips to a constituency surgery of the Conservative MP for Finchley and Golders Green in London, Mike Freer, had also been carried out by Mr Ali a month before Sir David was stabbed, the court heard. Mr Ali had also researched Justice Secretary Dominic Raab and Labour leader Keir Starmer QC in September 2021, said Mr Little. The jury heard he then researched Southend-on-Sea and Sir David Amess in September before looking for train companies for a journey from Barking to Leigh-on-Sea on 14 October, the day before Sir David was stabbed. The preparing acts of terrorism charge relates to activity alleged to have been carried out between 1 May 2019 and 28 September 2021. Mr Ali, of Kentish Town, north London, appeared in the dock wearing a black robe and black-rimmed glasses. The jury were told  by the prosecution that Mr Ali's mental health did not form any part of his defence. The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.

UK blames Russia for hoax calls to cabinet ministers,2022-03-21T15:17:58.000Z,"The UK government has publicly blamed Russia for hoax calls about the conflict in Ukraine made to British cabinet ministers. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel said they had been contacted by imposters last week. Downing Street has now revealed an unsuccessful attempt was also made to contact Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries. A No 10 spokesman added that further hoax calls to ministers are expected. There is understood to be concern in government that doctored recordings of the calls may be made public to reinforce Russian claims about the war. UK ministers targeted by hoax calls over UkraineBoris Johnson targeted by Russian hoaxer On Friday, Mr Wallace blamed ""Russian disinformation, distortion and dirty tricks"" for a man calling him pretending to be Ukrainian PM Denys Shmyhal. Home Secretary Priti Patel then revealed shortly afterwards that she had received a similar call earlier in the week.  On Monday, Boris Johnson's spokesman told reporters that ""the Russian state was responsible for the hoax telephone calls made to UK ministers last week"". The spokesman did not give further details, but added: ""This is standard practice for Russian information operations. ""Disinformation is a tactic straight from the Kremlin playbook to try to distract from their illegal activities in Ukraine and the human rights abuses being committed there. ""We are seeing a string of distraction stories and outright lies from the Kremlin, reflecting Putin's desperation as he seeks to hide the scale of the conflict and Russia's failings on the battlefield."" It is understood that Mr Wallace was put through to a Microsoft Teams video call which lasted about 10 minutes. The video call was set up after an email, purportedly from an aide at the Ukrainian embassy in London, was sent to a government department and then forwarded to the Ministry of Defence. Mr Wallace was apparently asked about whether the UK would send warships to the Black Sea, and if Ukraine should get nuclear weapons. The defence secretary was also apparently asked about the prospect of Ukraine dropping its ambition to join Nato and becoming a ""neutral"" state. A cross-department government inquiry into how the call happened is ongoing.  Asked whether defences against hoax calls were strong enough, the No 10 spokesman said there was guidance on how such calls should be handled. It is not the first time that cabinet ministers have been targeted with hoax calls.  In 2018, UK diplomatic sources said they believed the Kremlin was behind a Russian prank caller targeting Mr Johnson, then foreign secretary, and pretending to be the prime minister of Armenia. Meanwhile, Russia's defence attache in the UK was summoned to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for a second time on Monday for a dressing down over Russian armed forces' tactics in Ukraine.  The department said senior official Laurence Lee ""protested in the strongest terms"" against the ""persistent and unjustified acts of violence being committed against innocent civilians by Russian forces"". ""Mr Lee emphasised that schools, theatres and hospitals are not legitimate military targets,"" the MoD added. ""He warned the UK will be collecting evidence of war crimes and repeated the UK's demand for the Russian Federation to withdraw its forces immediately""."
Police send over 100 questionnaires on No 10 parties,2022-03-21T18:23:53.000Z,"The Metropolitan Police has sent out over 100 questionnaires as it continues to investigate parties that took place in Downing Street while Covid restrictions were in place. The force said it had now begun interviewing witnesses and may need to contact more over the gatherings. The Met launched its investigation in January after a string of reports about lockdown parties across Whitehall. It is formally investigating 12 events, including three the PM attended. Boris Johnson has refused to say whether he was at another alleged event, said to have been held in his Downing Street flat in November 2020. Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, called on the prime minister ""come clean"" and reveal if he was being interviewed by the police, as well as whether he would resign if found to have broken the law. He added: ""No more fluff, just the facts for all those who suffered during lockdown while he partied.""  A timeline of the lockdown partiesWhat is going on with the partygate probe?The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held Can Boris Johnson avoid a lockdown party fine? Initial findings from an inquiry by senior civil servant Sue Gray said there had been ""failures of leadership and judgement"" over the parties, as well as excessive drinking at work against the backdrop of the pandemic. She has pledged to update her report after the police finish their investigation.  In a statement on Monday, the Met said detectives from the Operation Hillman investigation team had started interviewing ""key witnesses"". The force added: ""To date, over 100 questionnaires have been sent out asking the recipients about their participation in alleged gatherings.  ""The questionnaires provide recipients with the opportunity to give an account of their involvement and the responses form part of the investigative material for the operation."" All recipients - including both the prime minister and Chancellor Rishi Sunak - were given seven days to respond.  The statement said: ""As a result of responses so far, further individuals have been identified and questionnaires sent to them.  ""As the investigation continues, we may need to contact more people as further information comes to light."" The force has not issued any fixed penalty notices for breaching of lockdown rules in connection with events in Downing Street and Whitehall. But the Met added: ""Every questionnaire response is being assessed alongside all available evidence, and should this reach the evidential threshold, then referrals will be made."" The Met's statement seems to have dashed any hopes that No 10 may have had for a swift conclusion to the so-called ""partygate"" probe. Indeed, inquiries into events in Downing Street and nearby government buildings in 2020 and 2021 appear to be expanding. And there have been suggestions that the size of the police inquiry team is to be increased to deal with the volume of work. I was told that some Downing Street staff had felt aggrieved to have received police questionnaires, while some of their colleagues who had attended the same events had not.   It now seems that some of them may have been pointing fingers, leading to more police questionnaires being issued and elongating the whole process.  And the full report by senior civil servant Sue Gray can't be published until the police conclude their inquiries. Two Conservative MPs have withdrawn letters of no confidence in the prime minister, believing it would be wrong to hold a leadership contest against the backdrop of the Ukraine conflict. But some others have told me they have no intention of doing so, and that a long-running investigation has the potential to inflict serious political damage to Boris Johnson."
Ukraine war: Holocaust survivor killed by Russian shelling in Kharkiv,2022-03-21T19:47:02.000Z,"A Ukrainian man who survived the Nazi Holocaust during World War Two has been killed during a Russian attack on the eastern city of Kharkiv.  Boris Romantschenko, 96, died during Russian shelling of his apartment block on Friday, relatives said.  Russian forces have been relentlessly shelling Kharkiv, which lies just 30 miles (50km) from the border, for over three weeks.  At least 500 civilians have now been killed there, Ukrainian officials say.  Police said one of the victims has been identified as a nine-year old boy.  The Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation said it was ""deeply disturbed"" by Romantschenko's death.  The organisation, of which Romantschenko was vice-president, announced the news after being informed by his family and said he had ""worked intensely on the memory of Nazi crimes"".  ""We mourn the loss of a close friend. We wish his son and granddaughter, who brought us the sad news, a lot of strength in these difficult times,"" the foundation's statement added. Romantschenko's death comes more than three weeks after President Vladimir Putin sought to justify his invasion to the Russian people by telling them his goal is to""de-Nazify Ukraine"".  Western leaders have condemned these claims and pointed out that Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is Jewish.  Romantschenko was born in the north-eastern city of Bondari on 20 January 1926.  He was rounded up by Nazi troops at the age of 16 after the invasion of the Soviet Union and deported to Germany in 1942, where he was forced to do hard labour, the foundation said. After a failed escape attempt in 1943, he was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where some 56,545 people were murdered before its liberation in 1945 by the allies.  He also spent time in the subcamp of Mittelbau-Dora, as well as the infamous Bergen Belsen and PeenemÃ¼nde camps.  Romantschenko, who was not Jewish, returned to Buchenwald in 2012 to celebrate the 67th anniversary of the liberation of the camp by US troops, where he recited the pledge made by survivors to create ""a new world where peace and freedom reign"".  The Nazi regime murdered over six million Jewish people across occupied Europe between 1941 and 1945.

"New P&O crew on less than Â£2 an hour, union claims",2022-03-22T07:07:22.000Z,"Indian agency workers hired to replace P&O Ferries crews in Dover are being paid Â£1.81 an hour, a union claims. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said the low pay was a ""shocking exploitation"" and ""a betrayal of those who have been sacked"". P&O said the figure was inaccurate but said it could not comment on how much agencies pay workers on ferries. Some of P&O's ferries are registered in Cyprus, meaning they do not have to pay the minimum wage required by UK law. Firms using UK ports often register ships in other countries, allowing them to pay lower wages. The minimum wage in the UK for people aged 23 and above is Â£8.91 per hour.  Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal?P&O Ferries' job cuts a 'PR disaster', say expertsMinisters review P&O Ferries contracts Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Parliament: ""Maritime employees have not, in this country, indeed throughout much of the world, received some of the same benefits and protections that exist otherwise for workers and this is simply not good enough and it's a practice we have been seeking to end."" He said ships in UK waters operated under international law governed by treaties, so UK law did not always apply. ""These complications allow for employers to take advantage in a way that we've seen I think with P&O Ferries,"" Mr Shapps added. Mr Shapps told MPs that he first found out about the prospect of P&O redundancies at 20:30 GMT the evening before the workers were being sacked, but he said it wasn't until he was at the despatch box the next day that he was made fully aware of the scale. Previously, officials at the Department of Transport had told the BBC that Mr Shapps and the maritime minister Robert Courts had not been informed until Thursday. Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said government ministers had ""completely failed to act"" and the reported rates of pay were ""nothing short of a betrayal of the workers who protected this country's supply chain during the pandemic"". A spokesman for P&O said safety was the utmost priority and the new crewing management model was used by many competitors.  ""They have recruited high-quality experienced seafarers, who will now familiarise themselves with the ships, going through all mandatory training requirements set out by our regulators,"" he said. Mr Shapps said the government was reviewing all of its contracts with P&O Ferries.  He had asked the insolvency service whether P&O had followed rules for redundancies - and if they had not, ""that would be a matter for criminal prosecution and unlimited fines"". Mr Shapps also told MPs P&O Ferries should remove British references from their ships if they replace sacked workers with non-UK staff. The Spirit of Britain, Pride of Canterbury and Pride of Hull are among the names used for the operator's ferries. The Transport Secretary told MPs it would be ""completely inappropriate"" for the company to ""attach themselves to this country"" without having British workers. Protests took place close to Parliament and also outside the London offices of P&O owners, DP World on Monday. John, a former seafarer with P&O Ferries based in Dover said the redundancies were ""a catastrophe"" for all crew involved and he wants the company's chief executive to resign. ""A company who had built up its reputation over 180 years just to be trashed in one single morning of madness by those responsible. ""It's not just a job, it's a home and to be kicked off the ship in the most unceremonious way...it's a catastrophe for all our lives,"" John, who did not want to give his surname, added. He expects to lose his severance pay for speaking out to media, but said he ""knew the difference between right and wrong"". RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said P&O staff were ""being replaced by exploited workers, vulnerable workers from overseas"".  ""We have no beef with those people. We want those people to be paid the wages that we've negotiated for in this country,"" he said. The union has called for a boycott of P&O services and is urging the government to look at legal options to reinstate the sacked workers. Ferries between Liverpool and Dublin have restarted and other routes are expected to follow by the end of the week. Services were stopped on Thursday after P&O announced in a video call that 800 staff were being sacked with immediate effect. The M20 in Kent will close between junctions 8 and 9 from 20:00 GMT while a barrier system is put in place to manage any disruption caused by P&O freight, National Highways said. The motorway is expected to reopen at 06:00 GMT on Tuesday when lorries heading for the Port of Dover or the Eurotunnel will use the coastbound carriageway on the M20, where they will be queued if necessary.  All other traffic - including local freight and car drivers headed for the continent - should follow the signs and cross over to enter the contraflow on the M20 London bound carriageway, National Highways said."

Kaden Reddick: Topshop and Arcadia guilty of safety breaches,2022-03-21T16:00:09.000Z,"Topshop and its former owners have been found guilty of health and safety breaches after a 10-year-old boy died when a queue barrier toppled on him.  Kaden Reddick suffered a fatal head injury at the Reading store during a family shopping trip in 2017. Following a two-month trial, Arcadia Group and Topshop/Topman were convicted of failing to discharge a health and safety duty. A jury found barrier manufacturer Realm Projects not guilty of the same charge. Stoneforce Ltd, which was contracted to fit the barriers, had earlier pleaded guilty to failing to discharge a health and safety duty. During the trial, Reading Crown Court heard the barrier was installed between 2013 and 2014, during a major store refit. The plinth supporting the barrier at the store in Reading's Oracle shopping centre had only been fixed to the floor with two narrow screws and the ""wobbly"" barrier fell on Kaden, prosecutors said. Arcadia, Topshop/Topman and Stoneforce Ltd will be sentenced at a later date. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk"
"Logan Mwangi: Boy, five, could have survived for hours",2022-03-21T17:27:36.000Z,"A five-year-old boy may have survived for ""up to several hours"" after receiving severe injuries to his abdomen, a court has heard. The body of Logan Mwangi was found in the River Ogmore in Sarn, Bridgend county, last July with 56 injuries. These included a liver tear and part of his small bowel torn from his pancreas. Logan's mother Angharad Williamson, 31, his stepfather John Cole, 40, and a 14-year-old boy deny murder at Cardiff Crown Court. Details of injuries were given to jurors on Monday. Forensic pathologist Dr John Williams outlined 56 external injuries, including extensive bruising and some grazes and scratches across the boy's head, chest, back, arms and legs. Teen pushed river death boy down stairs, jury toldBoy, 5, disciplined at home, murder trial toldMurder trial told accused, 14, was 'a monster' Dr Williams described the injuries to Logan's bowel as ""rare"" in children, with possible causes a motor vehicle crash, a bicycle accident, or non-accidental injury. In the absence of a ""high velocity accident"", they were likely to have been caused by blows, kicks or ""impacts with a weapon"", he added. Dr Williams said duodenal injures (part of the small bowel) are ""commonly recorded"" in abused children. He told the jury there was evidence of changes to some of the abdominal injuries, suggesting the ""healing process had started"" which ""indicated a period of survival that may have potentially been up to several hours"". During cross-examination, Dr Williams accepted that it could have been the case that Logan survived for a much shorter period of time and clarified by saying: ""The features would dictate that death has not occurred immediately and that the injuries have not been sustained following death."" Dr Williams said there was also evidence of ""extensive deep scalp bruising over the back of the head"" which was ""consistent with blunt force injuries"". A cause of death was given as ""blunt force abdominal injury and cerebral injury including brain swelling and traumatic brain injury"". Despite the fact Logan was found in a river, pathologists found no evidence he had drowned. Later on Monday, Dr George Lammie, a neuropathologist who examined Logan's brain and spinal cord, told the trial the boy's brain was ""significantly swollen"" and there was ""evidence of recent traumatic damage and evidence of damage due to a lack of oxygen"". He said there was evidence of ""axonal injury"" which was generally caused by ""rapid acceleration or deceleration of a moving brain"". He explained that to be able to detect that kind of injury, as well as some of the deterioration of cells, a certain time period had to have passed between injury and death.    Dr Lammie added it was possible Logan could have suffered more than one head injury and survived for ""several hours"" after being injured, but could not say for sure whether swelling from the brain or blood loss from abdominal injuries was the immediate cause of death.  All three defendants deny murder and are also accused of perverting the course of justice. Ms Williamson and the youth have pleaded not guilty to perverting the course of justice, while Mr Cole admitted the charge. The trial continues."
Prince Andrew plans to attend Prince Philip service,2022-03-21T16:40:22.000Z,"The Duke of York will attend next week's thanksgiving service for Prince Philip, says his spokesperson. It will be Prince Andrew's first public appearance since the settlement of the civil sex assault case brought against him in the US by Virginia Giuffre. The service at Westminster Abbey will celebrate the life of his father, Prince Philip, who died last year. Prince Philip's grandson, Prince Harry, who lives in the US, has already said he will not be attending. The Queen would be expected to attend next Tuesday's service honouring the memory of her husband. But there have been concerns about her mobility and last week she was unable to go to the Commonwealth Service held in Westminster Abbey. Other members of the Royal Family will take part in the service remembering Prince Philip's life and legacy - although Prince Harry has already confirmed he will not be travelling from the US. Prince Harry has been involved in a legal dispute over the provision of security when he visits the UK. In the fall out from his high-profile court case, Prince Andrew lost the use of the title His Royal Highness and stepped back from public life, but his representative says he will attend the service commemorating his father. Prince Andrew pays settlement ending sex assault casePrince Andrew loses titles and use of HRHIs there any way back for Prince Andrew? This will be the first time he will have been seen at an event in public since agreeing to make payments to Ms Giuffre and her victims' rights charity in a settlement that ended the civil court case. Prince Andrew rejected any claims of wrongdoing, and the formal closure of the case earlier this month ended the prospect of a trial in New York. But there have been questions about the prince's reputational damage and his future role in royal events."
Mariupol: Why Mariupol is so important to Russia's plan,2022-03-21T18:15:02.000Z,"Mariupol has become the most heavily bombed and damaged city in Ukraine's war with Russia - having suffered the brunt of sustained Russian attacks. It is key to Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine. But why?  There are four main reasons why taking the port city would be such a strategic win for Russia - and a major blow for Ukraine. Geographically, the city of Mariupol occupies only a tiny area on the map but it now stands obstinately in the way of Russian forces who have burst out of the Crimean peninsula.  They are pushing north-east to try to link up with their comrades and Ukrainian-separatist allies in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.  General Sir Richard Barrons - former commander of UK Joint Forces Command - says capturing Mariupol is vital to Russia's war effort. ""When the Russians feel they have successfully concluded that battle, they will have completed a land bridge from Russia to Crimea and they will see this as a major strategic success.""  If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline - cutting-off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world. By holding out against advancing forces for the past three weeks, the defending Ukrainians have managed to preoccupy a large number of Russian troops. But that failure by Russia to secure a rapid capture of the city, has prompted Russian commanders to resort to a 21st Century version of mediaeval siege tactics.  They have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying over 90% of the city. They have also cut off access to electricity, heating, fresh water, food and medical supplies - creating a man-made humanitarian catastrophe which Moscow now blames on Ukraine for refusing to surrender by an 05:00 deadline on Monday. A Ukrainian MP has accused Russia of ""trying to starve Mariupol into surrender"". Ukraine has vowed to defend the city down to the last soldier. It may well come to that. Russian troops are slowly pushing into the centre and, in the absence of any kind of workable peace deal, Russia is now likely to intensify its bombardment - drawing little if any distinction between its armed defenders and the beleaguered civilian population which still numbers over 200,000.  If, and when, Russia takes full control of Mariupol this will free up close to 6,000 of its troops - organised into 1,000-strong battalion tactical groups - to then go and reinforce other Russian fronts around Ukraine.  There are a number of possibilities as to where they could be redeployed:  to the north-east to join the battle to encircle and destroy Ukraine's regular armed forces fighting pro-Kremlin separatists in the Donbas regionto the west to push towards Odesa, which would be Ukraine's last remaining major outlet to the Black Seato the north-west towards the city of Dnipro Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion Mariupol has long-been a strategically important port on the Sea of Azov, part of the Black Sea.  With its deep berths, it is the biggest port in the Azov Sea region and home to a major iron and steel works. In normal times, Mariupol is a key export hub for Ukraine's steel, coal and corn going to customers in the Middle East and beyond.  For eight years now, since Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the city has been sandwiched uncomfortably between Russian forces on that peninsula and the pro-Kremlin separatists in the breakaway self-declared republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.  Losing Mariupol would be a major blow to what is left of Ukraine's economy. Mariupol is home to a Ukrainian militia unit called the Azov Brigade, named after the Sea of Azov which links Mariupol to the rest of the Black Sea. The Azov Brigade contains far-right extremists, historically including neo-Nazis.  Although they form only the tiniest fraction of Ukraine's fighting forces, this has been a useful propaganda tool for Moscow, giving it a pretext for telling Russia's population that the young men it has sent to fight in Ukraine are there to rid their neighbour of neo-Nazis.  If Russia manages to capture alive significant numbers of Azov Brigade fighters it is likely they will be paraded on Russian state-controlled media as part of the ongoing information war to discredit Ukraine and its government. The capture of Mariupol by Russia, if it happens, will be psychologically significant for both sides in this war.  A Russian victory in Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population - through state-controlled media - that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress.  For President Putin, for whom this war appears to be personal, there is a historical significance to all this. He sees Ukraine's Black Sea coastline as belonging to something called Novorossiya (New Russia) - Russian lands that date back to the 18th Century empire.  Putin wants to revive that concept, ""rescuing Russians from the tyranny of a pro-western government in Kyiv"" as he sees it. Mariupol currently stands in the way of him achieving that aim.  But to Ukrainians, the loss of Mariupol would be a major blow - not just militarily and economically - but also to the minds of the men and women fighting on the ground, defending their country. Mariupol would be the first major city to fall to the Russians after Kherson, a strategically much less important city that was barely defended. There is another morale aspect here and that is of deterrence.  Mariupol has put up fierce resistance - but look at the cost. The city is decimated, it lies largely in ruins. It will go down in history alongside Grozny and Aleppo, places that Russia eventually bombed and shelled into submission, reducing them to rubble. The message to other Ukrainian cities is stark - if you choose to resist like Mariupol did then you can expect the same fate. ""The Russians couldn't walk into Mariupol,"" says Gen Sir Richard Barrons, ""they couldn't drive in with their tanks, so they've pounded it to rubble. And that's what we should expect to see anywhere else that really matters to them.""

Just Stop Oil: Why protesters are tying themselves to goalposts,2022-03-21T12:37:48.000Z,"If you've been watching the football recently, you may have noticed there have been some pretty weird stoppages. It's had nothing to do with VAR - or the actions of players. Protesters have been running onto the pitch and attempting to tie, handcuff or glue themselves to the goalposts. It's so far happened during four matches, with varying levels of success. In the game between Everton and Newcastle on 17 March, the match had to be stopped while security attempted to remove 21-year-old Louis McKechnie - who was eventually cut free using a pair of bolt cutters and was led from the ground, to boos from the crowd, by police. Merseyside Police have confirmed he was arrested and charged with pitch encroachment and aggravated trespass. The group that has claimed responsibility is called Just Stop Oil. They describe themselves as a ""coalition of groups working together"" to demand the government stop the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal in the UK. ""We must urgently end our reliance on fossil fuels to avoid irreversible changes in the earth's climate system,"" their website says. The group says it wants action both in the short and long-term to reduce demand for fossil fuel energy - such as home insulation and renewable energy. A really simple guide to climate change  Seven ways to curb climate change Small changes you can make for a greener life If the tactics seem familiar, it's because - like other groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain - Just Stop Oil claim to be willing to use ""non-violent civil resistance"" to make their point in public spaces. That includes things such as strikes, boycotts, mass protests and disruption. Some people have criticised those types of methods as being too extreme and creating too much disruption to people's lives. After the protest during the Everton game, presenter Gary Lineker said in a tweet whether ""you approve of this young man's methods or not, he's right, his future is perilous"". What is Extinction Rebellion and what are its aims?Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? In videos and messages posted online, those involved in the action have spoken about their involvement. Kai, 20, locked onto the goalpost at the Emirates Stadium during the Arsenal vs Liverpool match on 16 March.  ""I don't want food to run out for me or my loved ones when severe weather events mess up our food supply. I don't want billions of people to be forced from their homes,"" he says.  ""If we lose control of our climate, which is exactly where we're headed at the moment, then we put everything and everyone at risk.  ""My generation won't have a future."" Louis said ""it's 2022 and it's time to look up, time to step up and not stand by"".  ""It's time to act like it's an emergency,"" he adds. Christy, who attempted to disrupt the Wolves vs Leeds game on Friday, said ""it's ordinary people who suffer most"". He added: ""I trust the people and the people need to know how serious this is"". Speaking before the Tottenham vs West Ham match this weekend, Nathan, 22 from Coventry said: ""Right now millions around the world are reduced to fighting for their lives - rather than watching football."" ""We don't have to stand by and watch this happen. Ordinary people can say no, not in my name."" Sport is not the only thing the group has been involved in disrupting, with protesters pictured at the Bafta Awards. Just Stop Oil have not yet responded to Newsbeat's request for further comment.
