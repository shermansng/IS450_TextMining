Russia-Ukraine war updates for Sun Mar 13,2022-03-14 08:05:51+00:00,"This has been CNBC's live blog covering updates on the war in Ukraine. [Follow the latest updates here.]  Fighting has intensified around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, while Russian forces bombard cities across the country, killing civilians who are unable to escape.  Russian missiles hit a military training center near Lviv, in the west of Ukraine near the Poland border, on Sunday with the number of people killed and injured rising throughout the morning.  Meanwhile, Russian forces have made some gains in their attempts to fully seize the besieged port city of Mariupol in the south of the country. Conditions in the city are dire, with civilians trapped there with limited food, water and electricity.  More than 1,500 people have died in attacks on Mariupol to date, the Associated Press reported Sunday, citing the mayor's office. Ukraine's authorities accused Russia of preventing the evacuation of civilians.  Ukraine's Air Force Command claims it downed eight Russian military aircraft on Sunday, including four fixed-wing aircraft.  The command said on Facebook that it used anti-aircraft missiles to take down four planes, three helicopters and an unmanned aerial vehicle during an attack by Russian forces in the Kyiv region.  CNBC was unable to independently verify Ukraine's claim, which it made late Sunday. NBC News reported that air raid sirens sounded over Kyiv on Sunday morning.  Separately on Sunday, Russian missiles pounded a Ukraine military base near Lviv, only 20 miles (33 km) from the border with NATO nation Poland.  Ukraine officials said 35 people were killed and 135 injured in the Lviv attack.  Russian aircraft are flying 200 sorties a day, but mostly firing missiles from within Russian airspace rather than risking flights over Ukraine, according to a Friday report from military and security news site Defense One.— Ted Kemp  On Monday, U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan is set to meet in Rome with Yang Jiechi, director of the foreign affairs office for the Chinese Communist Party's central committee, according to official announcements.  ""The two sides will discuss ongoing efforts to manage the competition between our two countries and discuss the impact of Russia's war against Ukraine on regional and global security,"" National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said in a statement.  China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in a statement the meeting would discuss China-U.S. relations, as well as international and regional issues of mutual concern. He did not mention Russia or Ukraine.  China has refused to call Russia's attack on Ukraine an invasion. On Friday, Premier Li Keqiang said China was ""deeply"" worried about the crisis.  — Evelyn Cheng  Russia has asked China for military equipment to help in its invasion of Ukraine, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials.  Moscow has reportedly asked for military equipment and other assistance since it began the invasion on Feb. 24, the sources said.  The U.S. government was preparing to warn allies about the situation, according to the FT report. It comes as some observers believe Russia is running out of some of its weaponry.  Moscow had expected to make far more gains and face less resistance in its attack, according to analysts. That has led to Russian President Vladimir Putin becoming increasingly frustrated, current and former U.S. officials briefed on the matter told NBC News. They warned Putin may double down on the violence as a result.  U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is scheduled for talks Monday with China's top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, to discuss the invasion.  The FT reported that Sullivan is expected to warn officials that efforts to help Russia in the war or avoid sanctions would have consequences.  Read the full Financial Times report here.  —Jessica Bursztynsky  People are showing their sympathy for Ukrainians with notes and flowers outside the Ukraine Embassy in Washington, D.C.  Ukraine said a broken power line to the Chornobyl energy plant has been restored, the Associated Press reported.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later confirmed the news, saying Ukrainian specialist teams fixed one of two damaged lines and would now be able to deliver all required off-site power to the power plant.  The power station in Chornobyl, which suffered a nuclear meltdown in 1986, is currently controlled by Russian troops.  Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that ""heroes"" from the national power grid company managed to repair the connection, according to the AP report. That means the cooling systems that work to prevent radiation leaks are operating normally.  — Yun Li  The hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians still in Mariupol are facing the ""worst-case scenario"" unless leaders are able to reach a ""concrete humanitarian agreement urgently,"" the International Committee of the Red Cross warned.  Conditions in the heavily besieged port city are dire, with the Red Cross agency detailing shortages of food, water and medicine. People are risking their lives to find basic necessities and sheltering in unheated basements, it added.  ""We call on all parties involved in the fighting to place humanitarian imperatives first. People in Mariupol have endured a weekslong life-and-death nightmare. This needs to stop now. Their safety and their access to food, water and shelter must be guaranteed,"" Peter Maurer, ICRC president, said in a statement.  Russia and Ukraine have agreed to partial cease-fires to allow civilians to leave the city, but multiple reports indicate attacks continued after the set time. That's led Ukrainian leaders to accuse Moscow of refusing to let civilians out of the city.  —Jessica Bursztynsky  For those who remain in Kharkiv, a city in northeast Ukraine, many have taken refuge underground in the city's Metro stations.  — Adam Jeffery  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on software giants Oracle, Microsoft and SAP to stop support services for their products in Russia.  ""Now can be no 'half' decisions or 'halftones'! There is only black and white, good or evil! You are either for peace or support the bloody Russian aggressor to kill Ukrainian children and women,"" Zelenskky wrote on Twitter.  ""Stop supporting your products in Russia, stop the war!"" he added.  Ukrainian officials have been pressuring technology giants and corporations still doing business in Russia to pull their products and support from the country.  — Jessica Bursztynsky  American journalist and filmmaker Brent Renaud was killed by Russian forces on Sunday in Ukraine, a State Department spokesman confirmed.  ""We offer our sincerest condolences to his family on their loss and are offering all possible consular assistance. Out of respect for his family's privacy, we have no specifics to offer at this time,"" the spokesman.  Renaud was a Peabody Award-winning documentary filmmaker, television producer and journalist, who lived and worked in New York City and Little Rock, Ark., according to his biography on the Renaud Brothers website.  He worked with his brother Craig on a number of film and TV projects covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the earthquake in Haiti and political turmoil in Egypt and Libya, according to the website.  Renaud was also a contributor to the New York Times.  ""We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud's death. Brent was a talented filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years,"" The New York Times said in a statement. ""Though he had contributed to The Times in the past (most recently in 2015), he was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine. Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago.""  — Yun Li  International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said a Russian sovereign default could happen.  ""In terms of servicing debt obligations, I can say that no longer we think of Russian default as [an] improbable event,"" Georgieva said on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. ""Russia has the money to service its debt, but cannot access it.""  The country, whose Ukraine invasion has entered its third week, is facing those economic consequences amid massive sanctions by the U.S. and other allies.  Last week, rating agency Fitch downgraded Russia's sovereign rating by six notches further into junk territory to a C grade, saying a default is ""imminent.""  Moody's and S&P have also slashed the country's sovereign rating to ""junk"" status, saying Western sanctions could undermine Russia's ability to service its debt.  — Yun Li  An evacuation train in eastern Ukraine came under fire, killing the conductor and injuring another individual, the country's national railroad Ukrzaliznytsia said in a statement. It marks the latest attack against civilians who are attempting to escape violence.  It wasn't immediately clear how many people were on the train. The railroad company was working to evacuate the crew and passengers on the train, which includes about 100 children, it said.  The train was on its way to pick up evacuees from Lyman. It had been near the Brusyn station in the Donetsk region when it was hit by shelling, the company said in a Facebook post.  Ultimately, the train was headed to Lviv, a city in the Western part of Ukraine that many refugees have seen as a transfer point to get to safety, Ukrainian official Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a Telegram post.  ""The occupiers crossed all possible boundaries of common sense and humanity,"" Kyrylenko said. ""They must receive proper punishment for their hellish crimes!""  —Jessica Bursztynsky  At least 596 people, including 43 children, have been killed since Russia began its invasion on Ukraine, the United Nations said. An additional 1,067 civilians, including 57 children, were wounded as of midnight on Saturday.   U.N. officials have said they believe actual casualties are ""considerably higher,"" as reports in some areas are delayed and others are pending confirmation.  Most of the casualties have been caused by the use of explosive weapons that have a ""wide impact area,"" including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, missiles and airstrikes, the agency said.  The death toll has continued to rapidly mount since troops invaded on Feb. 24, while Ukrainians still are trying to flee the country. U.S. officials have said they are collecting evidence of possible war crimes, human rights abuses and violations of international law by Russia.  ""What we've been seeing in recent three weeks is a series of deliberately committed war crimes, crimes against humanity,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Sunday of civilian deaths on CBS's ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan."" ""And when they bomb hospitals, maternity houses, schools, when they kill civilians passing by trying to be evacuated from the war zone, that, of course, indicates that they are trying to break us down and to destroy us.""  —Jessica Bursztynsky  A second Ukrainian mayor was abducted by Russian forces on Sunday according to Dmytro Kuleba, the nation's top diplomat.  ""Today, Russian war criminals abducted another democratically elected Ukrainian mayor, head of Dniprorudne Yevhen Matveyev,"" Kuleba wrote on Twitter.   Yevhen Matveyev, the mayor of Dniprorudne, a southern port city in Ukraine, is the second known mayor to be captured by Russian forces. Ukrainian officials said the mayor of the southeastern city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, was captured by Russian soldiers on Saturday.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote in a tweet on Saturday that he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for help in the release of Fedorov.  — Amanda Macias  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a hospital to meet with wounded service members fighting against Russian forces.  In the three-minute video, which was posted on Telegram, Zelenskyy is seen at the bedside of wounded troops, shaking hands and posing for selfies. He also appears to award one soldier with a medal.  — Amanda Macias  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on allies and partners to continue to supply his country with more firepower, as the Kremlin's war approaches the fourth week.  Kuleba also said he does not expect NATO allies to defend Ukraine in the event of a potential chemical attack. Instead, he called on the alliance to deploy more weapons and defensive systems.  ""We say arm Ukraine and we will do the rest. Give us all the weapons necessary and we will fight for our own land and for our people, Kuleba told CBS Sunday program ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""  He added that ""the most pressing issue"" is to equip the Ukrainian Air Force with more planes.  He described Ukraine's air power as ""uncomparable"" to Russia's fleet. Last week, the Pentagon scrapped a plan to send Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine citing logistics issues of flying aircraft into contested airspace.  — Amanda Macias  Military Chaplain Nikolay Medynsky blesses Ukrainian soldiers in Kyiv as Russia's attack on the Ukraine continues.  -Adam Jeffery  Russian Instagram users were alerted that the Meta-owned platform will cease operations in the country starting at midnight.  The state communications regulator sent an email encouraging people to move their photos and videos from Instagram before it was shut down and to switch to Russia's own ""competitive internet platforms,"" Reuters reported.  Instagram chief Adam Mosseri has said the decision would cut 80 million users in Russia off from one another.  The decision comes after Meta began allowing users in Ukraine to call for violence against Russia's president and military. Russia opened a criminal case against the company, attempting to have it declared an extremist organization because of the temporary change in its hate speech policy to permit threats on Instagram and Facebook in the context of Russia's Ukraine invasion.  Russia's media regulator has already blocked Meta's flagship app Facebook in the country.  —Jessica Bursztynsky  National security adviser Jake Sullivan will meet in Rome on Monday with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, to discuss the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.  The meeting, which will include officials from the National Security Council and State Department, follows warnings from Washington that Beijing should not alleviate the economic pressure mounting on Moscow.  ""The two sides will discuss ongoing efforts to manage the competition between our two countries and discuss the impact of Russia's war against Ukraine on regional and global security,"" the White House said in a statement.  Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash in a Sunday interview that ""there will absolutely be consequences for large scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them.""  ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country anywhere in the world,"" he added.  Sullivan will also meet with Luigi Mattiolo, a diplomatic advisor to Italy's prime minister, on ""coordinating a strong, united international response to President Putin's war of choice.""  — Amanda Macias  The Pentagon is working to send additional military equipment to Ukraine as part of President Joe Biden's weekend authorization of an additional $200 million.  ""We're going to get working on that right away to get that additional material into their hands,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told ABC News on Sunday.  Kirby declined to specify what type of U.S. military equipment could be forward deployed to Ukraine but said that the most effective platforms are air defense systems, drones and man-portable air-defense systems or MANPADS.  ""They are doing very well with that and we believe those are what they need the most,"" Kirby added.  — Amanda Macias  Russian police arrested numerous anti-war protesters in St. Petersburg and Moscow as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues.  -Adam Jeffery  National security advisor Jake Sullivan condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin's rhetoric around Moscow's nuclear posture and warned of potential miscalculations.  Last month, Putin placed his nation's nuclear forces on high alert amid tensions with the West over the invasion of Ukraine. Putin, speaking in a meeting on Feb. 27 with his top defense officials, cited ""aggressive statements"" made against Russia by NATO as a reason to order the elevation.  ""We are watching this extremely closely and obviously the escalation risk with nuclear power is severe and it is a different kind of conflict,"" Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash when asked if Putin would use a nuclear weapon.  Of the world's combined nuclear weapons inventory, Washington and Moscow own the lion's share with approximately 4,000 warheads each.  Sullivan added that the U.S. has not adjusted its nuclear weapons posture but that the administration is monitoring this issue ""day by day, hour by hour because it is a paramount priority to the president.""  — Amanda Macias  The Biden administration said it is watching to see if the world's second-largest economy comes to the aid of Russian President Vladimir Putin amid a slew of punishing sanctions.  National security advisor Jake Sullivan said the U.S. believes China was aware of Putin's pre-planned invasion of Ukraine.  ""They [China] may not have understood the full extent of it because it's very possible that Putin lied to them the same way that he lied to Europeans and others,"" Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash.  ""We also are watching closely to see the extent to which China actually does provide any form of support, material support or economic support to Russia. It is a concern of ours and we have communicated to Beijing that we will not stand by and allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses,"" he added.  — Amanda Macias  National security advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""does not look like he is prepared to stop the onslaught"" in Ukraine.  Sullivan told CNN's Sunday program that while the United States will not send troops to fight in Ukraine, the Biden administration will ""escalate the pressure against him [Putin] and continue to support the Ukrainians.""  Sullivan added that the U.S. was coordinating with NATO allies on sending additional military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.  — Amanda Macias  Russia said it is counting on China to assist it as Western sanctions batter its economy, Reuters reported. The sanctions have frozen nearly half of the country's gold and foreign currency reserves.  ""We have part of our gold and foreign exchange reserves in the Chinese currency, in yuan. And we see what pressure is being exerted by Western countries on China in order to limit mutual trade with China. Of course, there is pressure to limit access to those reserves,"" Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said.  ""But I think that our partnership with China will still allow us to maintain the cooperation that we have achieved, and not only maintain, but also increase it in an environment where Western markets are closing.""  Siluanov made the remarks in a TV interview, Reuters said, and made it clear that Moscow is reaching out to China to help cushion the blow on its economy.  — Terri Cullen  Pope Francis has issued a strong condemnation of the war in Ukraine, saying the ""unacceptable armed aggression"" must stop before it reduces cities to cemeteries.  ""In the name of God, let the cries of those who suffer be heard and let the bombings and attacks cease,"" Pope Francis said during his Sunday blessing, addressing thousands of people in St. Peter's Square in Rome.  ""Let there be a real and decisive focus on negotiation, and let the humanitarian corridors be effective and safe. In the name of God, I ask you: stop this massacre,"" he said, describing the killing of children and unarmed civilians as ""barbaric.""  — Holly Ellyatt  Britain is exploring whether it can use properties belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarchs for humanitarian purposes.  Housing Secretary Michael Gove said Sunday that seized homes in Britain could potentially be used to house refugees from Ukraine as the government seeks to improve its response to the migrant crisis following heavy criticism.  ""I want to explore an option which would allow us to use the homes and properties of sanctioned individuals for as long as they are sanctioned for humanitarian and other purposes,"" Gove told the BBC.  Given that the sanctioned properties have not been permanently confiscated, Gove noted that the legal barriers of such a move could be high. However, he added, ""if we can use [the properties] in order to help others, let's do that.""  — Karen Gilchrist  At least 35 people have been killed and 134 injured after Russia attacked a military training base in western Ukraine, the Lviv regional governor said on Sunday.  The death toll has risen from an earlier tally that stated there had been nine fatalities and 57 people wounded in the attack on the International Peacekeeping and Security Centre (IPSC), in Ukraine's Yavoriv district.  That location of the military facility, which is used for training Ukraine's armed forces, is around 32 miles (52 km) from the major western Ukrainian city of Lviv.  — Holly Ellyatt  Poland's President Andrzej Duda said in an interview on Sunday that the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be a ""game changer"" and a red line for NATO.  ""If he uses any weapons of mass destruction then this will be a game changer in the whole thing,"" he told the BBC's Sophie Raworth on Sunday, adding that NATO would have to ""think seriously what to do because then it starts to be dangerous.""  With his almost universally condemned invasion of Ukraine, which began on Feb.24, Russian President Vladimir Putin is seen as an increasingly unpredictable leader.  As Russia is facing far more resistance than it expected in Ukraine, and appearing to prepare to attack the capital Kyiv, there are fears that Putin could resort to using unconventional — and outlawed — weapons.  — Holly Ellyatt  Nine people have been killed and 57 wounded in an air strike on a military facility in western Ukraine, according to a Reuters report citing the governor of the Lviv region, where the facility is located.  Russia targeted the military training center in western Ukraine, close to the border with Poland, earlier on Saturday. Lviv's regional military administration said that eight missiles were fired at the International Peacekeeping and Security Centre (IPSC), in Ukraine's Yavoriv district. That location is around 34 miles (55 km) from the major western Ukrainian city of Lviv.  A ministry representative told Reuters the ministry was still trying to establish if any of the instructors were at the centre at the time of the attack.  ""Russia has attacked the International Center for Peacekeeping & Security near Lviv. Foreign instructors work here. Information about the victims is being clarified,"" Reznikov said in an online post, Reuters reported.  — Holly Ellyatt  The U.K.'s Ministry of Defense said Sunday that Russian forces are attempting to envelop Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.  The authorities said that military personnel are seen advancing from Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south.  Additional Russian forces advancing from Crimea are trying to circumvent Mykolaiv in the south as they attempt to drive west toward Odesa, the ministry said in a tweet.  ""Russia is paying a high price for each advance as the Ukrainian Armed Forces continues to offer staunch resistance across the country,"" it said.  — Karen Gilchrist  Russia has targeted a military training center in western Ukraine, close to the border with Poland, according to Ukrainian authorities.  Lviv's regional military administration said that eight missiles were fired at the International Peacekeeping and Security Centre (IPSC), in Ukraine's Yavoriv district.  That location is around 34 miles (55 km) from Lviv, a major city in the west of Ukraine where thousands of civilians have fled to or passed through as they try to get to Poland.  The IPSC is a training center for the Ukrainian army, particularly for peacekeeping missions. Information about any casualties is being established, the administration said.  At the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, its forces attacked predominantly in the north, east and south of the country, but in recent days Moscow has expanded its attacks to sites in the center and west.  — Holly Ellyatt  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on Sunday that Russia might use chemical weapons against Ukrainians, Reuters reported, citing an interview with a German newspaper.  Stoltenberg told Welt am Sonntag that such an attack would constitute a war crime, but that Russia appeared to be inventing advance justification for using chemical weapons.  ""In recent days, we have heard absurd claims about chemical and biological weapons laboratories,"" said Stoltenberg, who added that the Kremlin was creating a false pretext to justify something that can't be justified.  — Ted Kemp  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a nightly address that Russia is trying to break up the country by creating new ""pseudo-republics,"" the Associated Press reported.  ""The occupiers on the territory of the Kherson region are trying to repeat the sad experience of the formation of pseudo-republics,"" Zelenskyy said, according to AP. ""They are blackmailing local leaders, putting pressure on deputies, looking for someone to bribe.""  Zelenskyy said that Kherson city council members on Saturday rejected plans for a new republic. Kherson is in Ukraine's south and now under the control of Russian forces.  Before invading Ukraine in late February, Russia ""recognized"" the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as new, independent countries.  Russia has supported a separatist war in the east of Ukraine since 2014.  — Ted Kemp "
"Kurdistan: Rockets hit northern Iraq's Kurdish capital, no casualties",2022-03-14 13:40:24+00:00,"Iran's Revolutionary Guards claimed responsibility for a dozen ballistic missiles that struck Iraq's northern Kurdish regional capital of Irbil in the early hours of Sunday, Iran's state media reported, adding that the attack was against Israeli ""strategic centers"" in Irbil.  The missile attack comes as talks to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal face the prospect of collapse after a last-minute Russian demand forced world powers to pause negotiations for an undetermined time despite having a largely completed text.  The missiles, which targeted the U.S. consulate's new building, caused only material damage and one civilian was injured, the Kurdish interior ministry said. An Iraqi security official told Reuters that the missiles were manufactured in Iran.  ""Any repetition of attacks by Israel will be met with a harsh, decisive and destructive response,"" the Revolutionary Guard said in a statement reported by state media.  A U.S. official blamed Iran for the attack earlier on Sunday but did not give further details. Iranian officials have yet to comment.  Separately, U.S. State Department spokesperson called it an ""outrageous attack"" but said no Americans were hurt and there was no damage to U.S. government facilities in Irbil.  U.S. forces stationed at Irbil's international airport complex have in the past come under fire from rocket and drone attacks that Washington blames on Iran-aligned militia groups, but no such attacks have occurred for several months.  ""It's premature to point finger of blame at specific party but initial reports show indisputably that it was a cross-border short range missile attack,"" an Iraqi security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.  ""Parts of the fired missiles were retrieved and it was manufactured by Iran,"" he said.  In another sign of increased regional tensions, Iran also suspended on Sunday a fifth round of talks with regional rival Saudi Arabia that were due to take place in Baghdad on Wednesday.  The last time ballistic missiles were directed at U.S. forces was in January 2020 - an Iranian retaliation for the U.S. killing earlier that month of its military commander Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad airport.  No U.S. personnel were killed in the 2020 attack but many suffered head injuries.  Iraq and neighboring Syria are regularly the scene of violence between the United States and Iran. Iran-backed Shi'ite Islamist militias have attacked U.S. forces in both countries and Washington has on occasion retaliated with air strikes.  An Israeli air strike in Syria on Monday killed two members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Iranian state media said this week. The IRGC vowed to retaliate, it said.  Kurdish officials did not immediately say where the missiles struck. A spokesperson for the regional authorities said there were no flight interruptions at Irbil airport.  Residents of Irbil posted videos online showing several large explosions, and some said the blasts shook their homes. Reuters could not independently verify those videos.  Iraq has been rocked by chronic instability since the defeat of the Sunni Islamist group Islamic State in 2017 by a loose coalition of Iraqi, U.S.-led and Iran-backed forces.  Since then, Iran-aligned militias have regularly attacked U.S. military and diplomatic sites in Iraq, U.S. and many Iraqi officials say. Iran denies involvement in those attacks.  Domestic politics has also fueled violence. Iraqi political parties, most of which have armed wings, are currently in tense talks over forming a government after an election in October. Shi'ite militia groups close to Iran warn in private that they will resort to violence if they are left out of any ruling coalition.  The chief political foes of those groups include their powerful Shi'ite rival, the populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has vowed to form a government that leaves out Iran's allies and includes Kurds and Sunnis.

"Warren Buffett is still buying Occidental Petroleum, adding shares worth $1.5 billion",2022-03-12 13:55:54+00:00,"Warren Buffett was not done.  After spending around $4.5 billion last week to buy 91.2 million shares of Occidental Petroleum, he's spent more than $1.5 billion this week to add another 27.1 million shares to Berkshire Hathaway's stake.  An SEC filing late Friday revealed the purchases were made on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at prices between $51.03 and $58.58. The weighted average of the buys is around $56.60.  That gives Berkshire a total of 118.3 million shares that are worth almost $6.9 billion at Friday's close of $57.95.  As a result, OXY moves up a notch to 9th place on Berkshire's list of biggest reported holdings of publicly-traded U.S. shares.  And it gives Berkshire nearly 12% of Occidental's outstanding shares.  When its warrants to buy nearly 84 million shares, obtained as part of its 2019 deal that helped finance Occidental's purchase of Anadarko, are included, the stake that the SEC pays attention to is around 20%.  The warrants have an exercise price of $59.624, which means they are a few cents away from being 'in the money.' Berkshire could then use them to buy at a price lower than the market price, generating an instant paper profit, which increases as the stock prices goes up.  Occidental shares are up nearly 90% over the last 12 months as oil prices have surged.  Shares of Berkshire touched an all-time high on Friday and are up 9% so far in 2022. "
"Western arms convoys to Ukraine 'legitimate targets,' Russia warns",2022-03-12 23:46:42+00:00,"As the war between Ukraine and Russia drags on, it is clear that Ukraine has mounted a far better resistance to Russian forces than many expected. To continue to do so, however, Ukraine will need more help from the West — and that brings with it a dangerous risk that the war could escalate to involve NATO.  Russia warned the West against sending further arms to Ukraine, saying such arms convoys could now be considered ""legitimate targets"" for the Russian armed forces.  Speaking to Russia's Channel One broadcaster on Saturday, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov issued a warning to the West that could lead to a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.  ""We warned the United States that pumping Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries orchestrated by them is not just a dangerous move, but an action that turns the corresponding convoys into legitimate targets,"" the deputy minister said, according to comments reported by Russia's state news agency TASS.  Ryabkov said there could be consequences to what he called the West's ""thoughtless transfer"" to Kyiv of weapons such as portable anti-aircraft missile systems and anti-tank missile systems, both of which have been supplied to Ukraine by several NATO members including the U.S. and U.K.   Close observers of Russia, and its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, expressed shock and dismay at Ryabkov's comments.  ""If Russia attacks Western arms shipments ... it takes the conflict to a new level, of NATO vs. Russia,"" Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said on Saturday, adding that a ""critical moment in this conflict [is] coming up.""  ""Does the West really realize the threat to our very system of government, and our way of life, from Putin, and is it willing to act,"" he asked.  Despite Russia's latest threats, the West is in a tricky position over Ukraine because its continued support for Ukraine in terms of arms, intelligence and financial aid, defense experts and strategists argue, could make or break Ukraine's resistance and could even tilt the war's outcome in Ukraine's favor, something that seemed unimaginable when Russia invaded over two weeks ago.  ""There can be a point where this balance [in the war] is shifted in favor of Ukraine,"" Wojciech Lorenz, a senior analyst at the International Security Programme at The Polish Institute of International Affairs, told CNBC.  Additional support from NATO's individual members in the form of arms shipments, intelligence and other forms of aid ""really makes a difference and is why Russia is doing so badly,"" he said.  There could even come a point, he added, where Ukraine is able to not only resist Russian forces but can launch counter-offensives against them ""and reclaim lost territory.""  While Ukraine has won the affection of people and governments around the world for its brave stand against Russia's invasion, Russia has been heavily sanctioned, making it geopolitically, economically and financially isolated and vulnerable.  With the World Bank's chief economist predicting that Russia is edging toward a default on its foreign debt while at home, numerous foreign brands have pulled out of Russia or ceased operations there, and Russian consumers are feeling the pain of the central bank's interest rate hike to 20% to bolster the crumbling ruble.  Aside from sanctions, which came swiftly and in a surprisingly unified way by the West, one of the biggest dilemmas for the West is how much military assistance it could and should extend to Ukraine. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but it is a pro-Western ally that's geopolitically important as a buffer state between Russia and the rest of Europe.  NATO has repeatedly said that it stands by Ukraine and its leadership under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and NATO countries have unilaterally offered and delivered weaponry to Ukraine to help it defend itself.  However, Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called on Western officials to provide more support. This ranges from more actionable maneuvers — such as imposing the full weight of sanctions on Russia and providing more arms — to the more problematic plea for a ""no-fly zone"" over Ukraine. NATO has rejected the latter request, saying this could bring it into direct confrontation with Russia.  Without that extra support from NATO, strategists said, Zelenskyy needs to keep Ukraine at the forefront of the world's geopolitical priorities, and to maintain other forms of support for the country.  ""At this critical juncture, every significant weapons shipment he [Zelenskyy] receives, every word of support he receives and every action NATO takes helps him and help Ukraine and he's trying to keep that squarely in the political view,"" Ian Lesser, vice president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, told CNBC on Thursday.  Describing Russia's invasion and military aggression against Ukraine as ""outrageous,"" Lesser said it was still vital to keep up the momentum of support for the country, be it through emotional support which people around the world can give, or media coverage. However, he questioned how long such support could be sustained.  ""There is already a shift in the discussion towards energy security, the cost to Western publics and economies, the stability of the international financial system. These are all very real issues of course but from Zelenskyy's point of view, these are all distractions from the principal problem which is the fate of his people in Ukraine.""  Crucially, Lesser said, Western partners would be more inclined to keep up their support of Ukraine if they ""believe that Ukraine can make good use of it.""  While Ukraine has a fighting chance of defeating Russia, analysts said that if the converse happens, President Vladimir Putin could be emboldened to attack NATO.  ""Russia wants to change the security architecture in Europe, and wants to recreate the empire by taking control of Belarus and Ukraine at a minimum, so even if they aren't able to achieve their goals now after a few years of reorganization they will try again,"" senior analyst Lorenz said.  Lorenz said Putin's intentions in this regard were made clear last December when Russia issued demands to the U.S. and NATO that it wanted legal guarantees ruling out NATO's eastward expansion and the deployment of weapons that, as Putin said in early December, ""threaten us in close vicinity to Russian territory.""  ""Russia just needs to be strategically defeated,"" Lorenz said, because if Putin feels that he has ""achieved a victory by further undermining the territorial integrity of Ukraine, or the West forces Ukraine to accept some humiliating peace conditions like the recognition of the annexation of Crimea or the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, then it will only mean that in a couple of years we'll have war between Russia and NATO.""  Russia's aggression in warfare appears to be becoming more indiscriminate, with its forces attacking a children's hospital and maternity ward on Wednesday. Russia said it had not targeted civilians at the hospital, despite images indicating civilians were caught up in the attack, while Ukraine accused it again of committing a war crime.  There are concerns that Russia might resort to using biological warfare against Ukraine, with intelligence officials fearing that Russia could invent a pretext to use chemical, or even nuclear, weapons either against Ukraine, or any other nation if Russia feels directly confronted.  At the start of Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, Putin warned Western nations that any interference in what he called Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine would be met with ""consequences greater than any you have faced in history."" He did not provide details on what that would entail.  Most analysts agree that NATO's current path of allowing member states to help Ukraine individually, while holding off on any collective measures, is the right one. But if Russia's assaults on Ukraine take a darker turn, such a stance could be harder to maintain.  ""NATO allies are appropriately concerned about the potential for a military escalation that could lead to a wider war between NATO and Russia,"" Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNBC Wednesday, although he praised the alliance's ""impressive steps"" so far to provide military support to Ukraine.  ""Such support is helping Ukrainians resist Russia's invasion, and Ukraine's military, its democratic government, and the country's citizens have demonstrated defiant resilience,"" he said.  Just how far Russia would — or could — go to retaliate against any nation helping Ukraine is uncertain, with analysts saying Putin's increasingly reckless and unpredictable behavior makes it hard to judge.  ""Considering where Russia currently stands, the potential for retaliation is currently limited — basically, Russia can't afford to retaliate beyond provocation and scaremongering,"" Anton Barbashin, a political analyst and editorial director of the journal Riddle Russia, told CNBC on Wednesday. He added that Russia would be hard-pressed to act, given that it's tied up in Ukraine.  However, he warned, ""other options can't be excluded."" "
"France, UK and Germany say Iran deal could collapse on Russian demands",2022-03-12 11:44:50+00:00,"France, Britain and Germany warned Russia on Saturday that its demands to have its trade guaranteed with Iran risked the collapse of an almost-completed nuclear deal.  Negotiators have reached the final stages of discussions to restore the so-called JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program, long seen by the West as a cover for developing atomic bombs.  However, last Saturday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov unexpectedly demanded sweeping guarantees that Russian trade with Iran would not be affected by sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.   ""Nobody should seek to exploit JCPOA negotiations to obtain assurances that are separate to the JCPOA,"" France, Britain and Germany — the so-called E3 European parties to the 2015 accord — said in a joint statement.  ""This risks the collapse of the deal,"" they said.  The deal on the table should be concluded with the utmost urgency, they added.  Washington has already insisted it will not agree to Russia's demands.  The 11-month-old international talks seek to bring Iran back into compliance with the deal's restrictions on its rapidly advancing nuclear activities and bring the United States back into the accord it left in 2018 under former President Donald Trump.  Oil markets are closely watching the progress of talks to see whether restrictions on Iranian crude exports might be lifted, which could help to offset disruption to supplies from Russia's war in Ukraine.

NATO chief warns Russia may use chemical weapons against Ukrainians,2022-03-13 04:01:33+00:00,"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Sunday that Russia might use chemical weapons following its invasion of Ukraine and that such a move would be a war crime, according to an interview in German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.  ""In recent days, we have heard absurd claims about chemical and biological weapons laboratories,"" Stoltenberg was quoted by Welt am Sonntag as saying, adding that the Kremlin was inventing false pretexts to justify what could not be justified.  ""Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies. That would be a war crime,"" Stoltenberg was quoted as saying.  He added that although the Ukrainian people were resisting the Russian invasion with courage, the coming days are likely to bring even greater hardship. "

Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates in week ahead,2022-03-12 01:25:30+00:00,"Investors may take the Federal Reserve's first post-pandemic interest rate hike in stride, while uncertainty over the Ukraine crisis continues to hang over markets.  The Fed has clearly broadcast that it intends to raise its target fed funds rate by a quarter percentage point from zero, and it is expected to announce that move at the end of its two-day meeting Wednesday. The central bank should also reveal new forecasts for interest rates, inflation and the economy.  There are a few economic reports of note in the week ahead, including the producer price index Tuesday, retail sales Wednesday and existing home sales Friday.  ""Earnings are over. Monetary policy is obviously going to be important here. I don't see the Fed surprising anyone next week,"" said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities. ""It's going to be a quarter point and then step into the background and watch what's happening in Europe.""  Stocks fell for the past week, with the Nasdaq Composite the worst performer with a 3.5% decline. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000, which outperformed the three major indexes, lost 1% for the week.  A surge in oil prices spooked investors, with crude spiking to $130 at the beginning of the week but trading back below $110 on Friday.  The S&P 500 was down about 2.9% for the week. Energy stocks were the top performers, up nearly 1.9% and the only positive major sector.  The impact of Russian sanctions on commodities markets and the lack of clarity around the outcome of the war in Ukraine are likely to keep volatility high across the financial markets.  The central bank's statement and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday will be closely watched for guidance on how central bank officials view the Ukraine crisis, and how much it could affect their outlook and the path for interest rates.  ""His guidance is probably not going to be all that different from what he had to say in the [congressional] testimony. Basically, downside risks to the growth outlook have increased, upside risks to inflation have risen,"" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America.  Because Russia is a giant commodities producer, its assault on Ukraine and resulting sanctions have set off a rally in commodities markets that has made already-scorching inflation even hotter. February's consumer price index was up 7.9%, and economists said rising gasoline prices could send it above 9% in March.  Gasoline at the pump jumped nearly 50 cents in the past week to $4.33 per gallon of unleaded, according to AAA.  Market pros see surging inflation as a catalyst that will keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates. However, uncertainty about the economic outlook could also mean the central bank might not hike as much as the seven rate increases that some economists forecast for this year.  Cabana expects Fed officials to forecast five hikes for 2022 and another four next year. The Fed previously anticipated three increases in both years. Cabana said the Fed could cut its forecast for 2024 to just one hike from the two in their last outlook.  Any comments from the Fed on what it plans for its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet will also be important, since officials have said they would like to begin to scale it back this year after they start hiking interest rates. The Fed replaces maturing Treasury bonds and mortgages as they roll off, and it could slow that in a process Wall Street has dubbed ""quantitative tightening,"" or QT.  ""That they will be ready to flip the switch on QT in May is our base case, but we acknowledge there are risks that this will be skewed later,"" said Cabana. He said if the Fed finds it is not in a position to raise interest rates as much as it hoped, it could delay shrinking the balance sheet right away, which would leave policy looser.  The 10-year Treasury yield topped 2% at its highest level Friday, after dipping below 1.7% earlier this month as investors sought safety in bonds. Bond yields move opposite price.  ""It's inflation and inflation expectations. Treasurys behave in this environment a little differently than a flight to quality asset,"" Cabana said ""That's a different dynamic than we've observed. You may see a flight to quality into Treasurys, but the Treasurys are reflecting higher inflation expectations.""  Cabana said the markets are showing signs of concern around the uncertainty in Ukraine. For instance, the Treasury market is less liquid.  ""We have seen that the Treasury market has become more volatile. We're seeing bid-ask spreads have widened. Some of the more traditionally less liquid parts of the market may have become less liquid, like TIPS and the 20-year. We're also seeing market depth thinning out,"" he said. ""This is all due to elevated uncertainty and lack of risk-taking willingness by market participants, and I think that should worry the Fed.""  But Cabana said markets are not showing major stress.  ""We're not seeing signs the wheels are falling off in funding or that counterparty credit risks are super elevated. But the signs there are very much that all is not well,"" he said.  ""The other thing we continue to watch loosely are funding markets, and those funding markets are showing a real premium for dollars. Folks are paying up a lot to get dollars in a way they haven't since Covid,"" he said.  Cabana said the market is looking for reassurance from the Fed that it is watching the conflict in Ukraine.  ""I think it would upset the market if the Fed reflected a very high degree of confidence in one direction or another,"" he said. ""That seems very unlikely.""  The dollar index was up 0.6% on the week and it has been rising during Russia's attack on Ukraine. The index is the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies and is heavily weighted toward the euro.  Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, also points out that the dollar funding market is seeing some pressure but it is not strained.  ""The dollar is at five-year highs today against the yen. That's not what you would expect in a risk-off environment,"" he said. ""That's a testament to the dollar's strength.""  Chandler said it's possible the dollar weakens in the coming week if it follows its usual interest rate hike playbook.  ""I think there might  be a buy the rumor, sell the fact on the Fed,"" he said. ""That's typical for the dollar to go up ahead of the rate hike and sell off afterwards.""  Oil gyrated wildly this past week, touching a high not seen since 2008, as the market worried there would not be enough oil supply due to sanctions on Russia. Buyers have shunned Moscow's oil for fear of running afoul of financial sanctions, and the U.S. said it would ban purchases of Russian oil.  West Texas Intermediate crude futures jumped to $130.50 per barrel at the beginning of the week but settling Friday at $109.33.  ""I think the market getting bid up to $130 was a little premature,"" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC, noting the U.S. ban on Russian oil. She said the run-up in prices Monday came as market players speculated there would be a broader embargo on Russian oil, including Europe, its main customer.  ""Right now, the market is too extreme in either way. I think it's justified at $110. I think it's justified over $100. I don't think we're headed for an off-ramp, and I think we have room to go higher,"" she said.

"42-year-old quit his job with $1.2M, but started work again in 2 years",2022-03-12 14:30:01+00:00,"If you ask Francis the best way to retire early, his answer is simple: don't.  For years, the now 42-year-old went to great lengths to achieve FIRE, which stands for ""financial independence, retire early."" But in reality, a lifetime without work isn't actually what most people want, he says. It's a lesson he himself discovered after retiring at age 37 in 2017.  ""I think pursuing FIRE is probably the wrong idea,"" Francis, who requested to have his last name withheld for privacy reasons, tells CNBC Make It. ""I don't think most people want to retire early. I think what most people want is a sabbatical of sorts. They're disgruntled with their careers and they want to take a really, really long time off. Maybe a year or two.""  That same disgruntlement led him to leave his job as an electrical engineer where he earned a $120,000 base salary plus $30,000 to $60,000 in equity and bonuses. But Francis describes life without a job as getting ""really boring."" In his case, he decided to lean into his YouTube hobby full time, and now earns money making videos for his 350,000 followers.  Francis quit his job in 2017 with $1.2 million in savings and investments. He had first heard about FIRE in 2013 and decided to dedicate himself to achieving it. His strategy to getting to an early retirement came down to one main factor: spending as little money as possible.  The first step was to pay off the mortgage on his home, which cost $22,000 a year. As he tackled this, he also worked to cut his spending anywhere he could.   ""I jumped through a lot of hoops in order to save money and get my expenses as low as possible,"" Francis says. His cost-cutting measures ranged from not paying for any streaming services to making sure he used every single item of food item in his refrigerator to even a short-lived stint without a cell phone.  Going phoneless ""turned out to not work very well, but I think it's important to push a little bit too hard, get a little bit too uncomfortable,"" he says. Eventually, with his house paid off, Francis was able to cut his annual spending down to less than $15,000.   His background in electrical engineering helped him slash household spending as well. He installed his own water heater and fixed the door to his garage when the power supply broke. He also built a solar panel system in his backyard that supplies a low amount of electricity for free.  ""I never call a handyman because I am the handyman,"" Francis says. ""All my appliances are really, really old because they never break. If they break, I fix them and they're good as new.""  Francis is a also master of collecting credit card points. He employs a process known as churning, which involves cycling between different credit cards to maximize points, and has more than 20 active credit cards at any given time.  ""In order to churn these credit cards, you need to have a really high credit score,"" he says, adding that his own score is 835. ""A lot of people think it's a hassle, but for me personally, it's giving me a lot of value.""  After two years of early retirement, during which he enjoyed his time off from work and made a point to travel, Francis came face-to-face with the boredom he warns most people will experience if they quit their jobs at a young age. His solution? Getting back to work.  In 2019, Francis began to double down on his YouTube channel and release videos regularly. He originally started the channel in 2013, posting videos ranging from how to make imitation shark fin soup to strategies for beating the popular game ""2048.""  He pivoted to financial topics, teaching viewers about credit scores and investing. As his views started climbing up, so too did his earnings. Though his workload fluctuates depending on his mood — some weeks he works almost full-time while others he does as little as eight hours — he has built up a following of more than 350,000 subscribers.  On his best months, he brings in close to $10,000 in YouTube revenue. He still keeps his same $15,000 annual budget and uses the income to pay his living expenses. The rest goes into his investment accounts.  It's a project that brings him more joy than his old 9-to-5, and one he plans to stick to for years to come.  ""Now I no longer call myself 'retired' because I am putting in my full-time effort into YouTube,"" Francis says. ""I'd like to put a lot more work into it and grow it ... I think it's a work in progress.""

Meet the company that lets you work remotely from anywhere in the world,2022-03-12 00:50:26+00:00,"Millions of Americans are quitting their jobs and rethinking what they want when it comes to work and work-life balance. Companies are responding, meeting their employees' needs in areas like remote work, flexible hours, four-day workweeks, compensation and more. This story is part of a series looking at the ""Great Reshuffle"" and the shift in workplace culture taking place right now.  For Sevdha Thompson, the average workday can look very different from week to week or month to month.  One week she may be working outside in the Jamaican sun, another she may be at an AirBNB overlooking a Costa Rican rainforest.  As a digital producer of marketing for digital marketing and website design company Coalition Technologies, she can work remotely from anywhere in the world.  ""I, for one, love traveling. I have family in many different places,"" she said.  ""Having that flexibility to be able to spend time with people who are very important to me, in different parts of the globe, it's of major importance.""  Thompson, currently staying in Orlando, Florida, lived in Los Angeles when she was first hired by Coalition Technologies in July 2020. She then moved to Kingston, Jamaica, to be closer to family during the Covid-19 pandemic. While she considers the Caribbean island her home base, she has also spent time in New Orleans, Atlanta, Panama, Texas and Oklahoma.  She visited Costa Rica for three weeks last year, touring the country and visiting several rainforests. The company's flexibility with work hours really helped, so she could shift her schedule around, she explained.  ""I was able to really delve into many facets of the country and culture that would otherwise be out of reach for the usual tourist,"" said Thompson, who is in her early 30s and travels with her fiancé.  ""I was able to gain more of a local experience in a lot of these areas because I had more time and flexibility to do so.""  She has also traveled to take jobs for her side gig as a professional Bollywood and belly dancer. When choosing a place to stay in each locale, she makes sure she has a good internet connection. She has worked while on the road as well — from cars, an airport lounge and a boat  While some U.S.-based employees, like Thompson, have used the work-from-anywhere policy to travel, others simply work from where they live. Today, Coalition Technologies' more than 250 workers are spread out across the globe — from the U.S., Canada and Mexico to India, Germany and South Africa.  More from Invest in You:This company 'surprises and delights' employees to keep them happyMeet the company that offers its contract workers benefits and job securityThis worker took three months off with pay to hike in Europe  The tech company's policy was borne out of a need to compete against larger firms for talent, said president Jordan Brannon.  Founded in 2009, Coalition Technologies has been remote-first for nearly a decade — a decision that was driven largely by traffic in Los Angeles, where the company was based. As more big tech firms moved into the area, dubbed Silicon Beach, Brannon and his team had to start looking for workers in other cities, states and countries.  ""When we're up against well-funded, VC-funded, publicly traded companies and startups, we really have to be able to source talent in a way that allows us to continue to grow without having, necessarily, a short-term profit objective for shareholders,"" Brannon said.  To be sure, work-from-anywhere jobs are uncommon, according to career website FlexJobs. About 95% of remote jobs require employees to be based in a specific location, it found. Geographic requirements may be based on state, city, country or even regions of the country.  There are legal and tax issues to consider, as well as time-zone differences and the ability to be available for in-person staff or client meetings.  Multiple time-zones is one of the biggest challenges facing Coalition Technologies, Brannon said. Most clients are in the U.S. eastern time zone, so schedules for some workers have to shift. They also use a common calendar where employees can sync schedules and coordinate meetings.  The management team also deals with legal, tax and financial issues stemming from the different work locations. For instance, there are regional adjustments for pay based on cost-of-living in a particular area, but there is also the opportunity to earn additional pay based on a team's performance.  Yet the trade-off is worth it, Brannon said. Not only does it help the company compete for workers, employees are happy. It also enables Coalition Technologies to bring more talented people to client accounts and projects, and staff up quickly since there is a large pool of candidates to choose from, he noted.  ""This is something we've been committed to for a decade and we don't have any reason to change,"" he said.  Thompson expects to eventually make the U.S. her home again, although she doesn't know exactly where she'll land. For now, she'll stay based in Jamaica, where she can help out with family members, as well continue her travels.  ""All of those little things mean a lot,"" she said.  ""They're very immeasurable ways to spend your time in which you otherwise couldn't in a more rigid job structure.""

Waiting for sanctions to stop Russia could go 'terribly wrong': Niall Ferguson,2022-03-11 10:37:17+00:00,"The strategy of sitting back and waiting for Russia's war machine to grind to a halt because of sanctions could go ""terribly wrong,"" according to Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.  ""It's a highly risky strategy,"" he said.  The Ukrainian resistance cannot hold the fort for much longer, and sanctions by the West won't be able to stop Russia in time, he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Friday.  He said the U.S. is relying heavily on sanctions and ""very belated arms deliveries"" to Ukraine, but he's concerned that those fighting for Ukraine won't be able to defend the country for long.  Though the Russians have sustained more casualties than expected, they are still ""advancing steadily,"" he said.  ""The assumption that this is going to drag out, that the United States can sit back and watch the economic sanctions do their work may be gravely mistaken,"" Ferguson said.  Anna Ohanyan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP) echoed that sentiment.  ""While the sanctions will start biting — perhaps can change Putin's behavior down the road — at this point, they cannot be relied on as an instrument to be used to stop the violence,"" said Ohanyan, a nonresident senior scholar in CEIP's Russia and Eurasia program.  ""It won't work fast enough to avert a Russian victory in Ukraine and I think this is the critical problem,"" Ferguson said.  The U.S. and its allies have imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. But it appears that there's a race between Russia's military advancements and the sanctions that are crippling Moscow.  ""There's no guarantee that Ukraine holds out, and what I dread is steadily worse news from Ukraine, and the breakdown of Ukraine's defenses,"" Ferguson said.  ""We'll sit there saying, oh, well the sanctions have really hurt Russia — but it won't matter to Putin because he will be able to claim victory. That for me is the nightmare scenario,"" he added.  Ferguson said the U.S. should help support Ukraine's defenses without escalating it into a full-blown NATO-Russia war.  Arms deliveries to Ukraine slowed down previously, and now there is a ""frantic effort"" to help Ukraine keep up the fight, he said.  That, however, may create the conditions of a proxy war, CEIP's Ohanyan said.  ""It appears that unfortunately, [at] this point, sanctions and the military assistance work at cross purposes,"" she said.  Ferguson also said the U.S. is ""missing an opportunity"" by leaning on sanctions.  He said he believes that a deal can be made between Russia and Ukraine if Kyiv is willing to accept neutrality and take NATO membership off the table.  He pointed to a 2014 proposal that former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger published, presenting the idea of Ukraine being a neutral country instead of attempting to join NATO.  ""It is clear that President Zelenskyy is open to that idea, which is a major shift in Ukraine's position for the sake of trying to save his country from further destruction,"" he said.  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week told ABC News that he has ""cooled down"" regarding the question of joining NATO.  He said Ukraine understands that NATO doesn't want to accept it into the alliance, and the country will not beg to be allowed into NATO.  Peace is ""urgently needed"" to avoid continued bloodshed and the destruction of Ukraine, which Ferguson said seems to be the Russian plan for now.  ""The goal was to prevent Ukraine being a successful democracy oriented towards the West, whether in NATO or the EU,"" he said. ""You can achieve that just by destroying Ukraine's infrastructure and turning it into a smoking pile of rubble and unfortunately, every passing day allows President Putin to do more of that,"" he said.  Ohanyan agreed that there has to be a diplomatic push to de-escalate, start a cease-fire and negotiate on ""bigger issues."" "
Steve Cohen’s Point72 to reportedly redeem $750 million from Melvin Capital,2022-03-12 19:24:04+00:00,"Billionaire investor Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management is pulling out the $750 million it invested in Melvin Capital Management, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.

Didi 44% stock plunge leaves SoftBank and Uber with weak returns,2022-03-12 00:30:24+00:00,"Didi shares tumbled 44% on Friday, the biggest one-day drop since the Chinese ride-hailing company went public in the U.S. in June.  The stock is now 87% below its IPO price, leaving its two top shareholders — SoftBank and Uber — facing the potential for steep losses.  The shares were already in freefall amid a crackdown by the Chinese government on domestic companies listed in the U.S. Didi said in December that it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange and instead list in Hong Kong. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Didi hadn't complied with data-security requirements necessary to proceed with a share sale in Hong Kong.  Softbank owns about 20% of Didi. The Japanese conglomerate's stake is now worth around $1.8 billion, down from close to $14 billion at the time of the IPO. Uber's roughly 12% stake has fallen from more than $8 billion in June to just over $1 billion today.  Uber acquired the stake in 2016 after selling its China business to Didi. Uber said in its latest annual report that in 2021 it recognized an unrealized $3 billion loss on its Didi investment.  The hole is deepening and reflects a broader headwind for the tech sector, which is getting hammered on the public market.  Goldman says retail investors are buying this market dip. Here are their favorite stocks  Forget Tesla — this auto stock is the one to buy right now, analyst says  Europe's moving away from Russian energy — and that could boost EV charging stocks  Earlier this week, database software maker Oracle said its investments in Oxford Nanopore and Ampere Computing pulled down profit in the fiscal third quarter by about 5 cents a share. And electric car maker Rivian, which counts Amazon as a top investor, fell 8% on Friday after a disappointing forecast and is now down 63% this year.  For SoftBank, Didi was one of the 83 companies it backed through its original first Vision Fund. Last year CNBC reported that SoftBank was selling part of its Uber position partly to cover its Didi losses.  ""Since we invested in Didi, we have seen a huge loss of value,"" Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's CEO, said in a February call to discuss results for the nine months ended Dec. 31.  SoftBank shares fell 6.6% at the close, while Uber rose 1.2%.  Didi wasn't the only Chinese tech stock to drop on Friday, though its decline was the heftiest.

Ukraine: Satellite imagery shows Russian convoy regrouping near Kyiv,2022-03-12 01:43:07+00:00,"A large Russian military convoy northwest of Ukraine's capital Kyiv appears to have been dispersed and redeployed, according to satellite images taken on Thursday by U.S. firm Maxar Technologies.  There are fears the development could signal a renewed push by Russian forces to bear down on Ukraine's capital. An earlier advance by the convoy had stalled around 30 kilometers outside of Kyiv.  The latest batch of satellite images, all dated Mar. 10, appear to show that armored units have fanned out through the towns close to Antonov airport on the outskirts of Kyiv, with howitzers thought to be situated in firing positions nearby.  Maxar, which works with U.S. government agencies to provide commercial satellite imagery, said the images indicated that the convoy had ""largely dispersed and redeployed.""  It comes as Russia's onslaught of Ukraine enters its 16th day, with invading troops seeking to maintain pressure on Kyiv and the besieged port city of Mariupol.  International governments have sought to isolate and sanction the Kremlin, with Ukrainian and Western officials admonishing Wednesday's deadly airstrike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol as a ""petrifying"" war crime.  The firm said the following image shows resupply trucks and ""probable"" multiple rocket launchers snaking along a road in Berestyanka, northwest of Kyiv.  A separate image from the past 24 hours shows Russian troops and military vehicles deployed in Ozera, northeast of Antonov Airport.  Maxar said the satellite photo below depicts trucks and equipment in convoy southeast of Ivankiv, a town in the Kyiv region.  Maxar also obtained satellite imagery of the Chornobyl nuclear facilities following warnings about Ukraine's nuclear security.  Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Wednesday warned the disconnection of the Chornobyl nuclear plant from power supplies was putting the entire European continent in danger.  The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, has since said the disconnection poses ""no critical impact on safety,"" but cautioned recent developments had violated a key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply.  An explosion and fire at the Chornobyl power plant on April 26, 1986, led to the world's worst nuclear disaster. "
Russia's attack on Ukraine halts half of world's neon output for chips,2022-03-12 04:53:20+00:00,"Ukraine's two leading suppliers of neon, which produce about half the world's supply of the key ingredient for making chips, have halted their operations as Moscow has sharpened its attack on the country, threatening to raise prices and aggravate the semiconductor shortage.  Some 45% to 54% of the world's semiconductor-grade neon, critical for the lasers used to make chips, comes from two Ukrainian companies, Ingas and Cryoin, according to Reuters calculations based on figures from the companies and market research firm Techcet. Global neon consumption for chip production reached about 540 metric tons last year, Techcet estimates.  Both firms have shuttered their operations, according to company representatives contacted by Reuters, as Russian troops have escalated their attacks on cities throughout Ukraine, killing civilians and destroying key infrastructure.  The stoppage casts a cloud over the worldwide output of chips, already in short supply after the coronavirus pandemic drove up demand for cellphones, laptops and later cars, forcing some firms to scale back production.  While estimates vary widely about the amount of neon stocks chipmakers keep on hand, production could take a hit if the conflict drags on, according to Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA.  ""If stockpiles are depleted by April and chipmakers do not have orders locked up in other regions of the world, it likely means further constraints for the broader supply chain and inability to manufacture the end-product for many key customers,"" he said.  Before the invasion, Ingas produced 15,000 to 20,000 cubic meters of neon per month for customers in Taiwan, Korea, China, the United States and Germany, with about 75% going to the chip industry, Nikolay Avdzhy, the company's chief commercial officer, said in an email to Reuters.  The company is based in Mariupol, which has been under siege by Russian forces. On Wednesday, Russian forces destroyed a maternity hospital there, in what Kyiv and Western allies called a war crime. Moscow said the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters.  ""Civilians are suffering,"" Avdzhy said by email last Friday, noting that the company's marketing officer could not respond because he had no internet or phone access.  Cryoin, which produced roughly 10,000 to 15,000 cubic meters of neon per month, and is located in Odessa, halted operations on Feb. 24 when the invasion began to keep employees safe, according to business development director Larissa Bondarenko.  Bondarenko said the company would be unable to fill orders for 13,000 cubic meters of neon in March unless the violence stopped. She said the company could weather at least three months with the plant closed, but warned that if equipment were damaged, that would prove a bigger drag on company finances and make it harder to restart operations quickly.  She also said she was unsure the company could access additional raw materials for purifying neon.  The Economy Ministry of Taiwan, home to the world's largest contract chip maker TSMC, said that Taiwanese firms had already made advanced preparations and had ""safety stocks"" of neon, so it did not see any supply chain problems in the near term. The statement to Reuters echoed similar remarks from Taiwan's central bank earlier on Friday.  But smaller chipmakers may be harder hit, according to Lita Shon-Roy, president of Techcet.  ""The largest chip fabricators, like Intel, Samsung and TSMC, have greater buying power and access to inventories that may cover them for longer periods of time, two months or more,"" she said. ""However, many other chip fabs do not have this kind of buffer,"" she added, noting that rumors of companies trying to build up inventory have begun to circulate. ""This will compound the issue of supply availability.""  Ukrainian neon is a byproduct of Russian steel manufacturing. The gas, which is also used in laser eye surgery, is produced in China as well, but Chinese prices are rising steadily.  Bondarenko says prices, already under pressure after the pandemic, had climbed by up to 500% from December. According to a Chinese media report that cited Chinese commodity market information provider biiinfo.com, the price of neon gas (99.9% content) in China has quadrupled from 400 yuan / cubic meter in October last year to more than 1,600 yuan / cubic meter in late February.  Neon prices rose 600% in the run-up to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, according to the US International Trade Commission.  Companies elsewhere could initiate neon production but it would take nine months to two years to ramp up, according to Richard Barnett, chief marketing officer of Supplyframe, which provides market intelligence to companies across the global electronics sectors.  But CFRA's Angelo Zino noted that companies may be unwilling to invest in that process if the supply crunch is seen as temporary. "
Russia restricts Instagram after Meta allows violent threats on forces,2022-03-11 18:41:38+00:00,"Russia's technology regulatory agency on Friday restricted access to Instagram after parent company Meta Platforms began allowing users in some countries to call for violence against Russia's president and military.   Russia earlier Friday opened a criminal case against Meta and sought to have it declared an extremist organization because of the temporary change in its hate speech policy to permit threats on Instagram and Facebook in the context of Russia's Ukraine invasion.  Roskomnadzor, the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications, said the limitations on access to Instagram will be limited ""based on the order of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation.""  Russia already blocked access in the country to Facebook on March 4 after the platform put limits on government-affiliated media outlets on the heels of the Ukraine invasion.  Instagram and Facebook each had more than 60 million users in Russia as of November, according to the data site Statista.  Reuters first reported the change to Meta's hate speech policy Thursday, citing internal emails from the company.  The policy allows Instagram and Facebook users in Russia, Ukraine and Poland to call for the death of the allies Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.  It also allows calls for violence against Russian soldiers in those three countries, and several others in Eastern Europe, the Baltics and western Asia.  Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:  ""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as 'death to the Russian invaders.' We still won't allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,"" a Meta spokesperson told Reuters in a statement.  CNBC reported Thursday that the use of virtual private networks, which can allow users to circumvent government restrictions to certain sites and apps, is surging in Russia.  Since Feb. 24, there has been a 1,500% increase in the number of downloads of the top 10 VPN apps in Apple's App Store and Google Play Store in Russia compared with the prior 13-day period, according to data from SensorTower compiled for CNBC.  Twitter on Thursday took down two tweets by Russia's embassy in the United Kingdom for what the company called ""the denial of violent events"" in the attack on Ukraine.   In one deleted tweet, Russia's embassy claimed a pregnant woman seen in a photo of casualties at a children's hospital in the port city of Mariupol that was destroyed by a Russian airstrike was really a Ukraine ""beauty blogger,"" suggesting that the photo was staged propaganda.  At least one child and two adults were killed at the hospital, and an additional 17 were injured, Ukraine officials have said. "

India says it accidentally fired missile into Pakistan,2022-03-12 01:29:18+00:00,"India said on Friday it had accidentally fired a missile into Pakistan this week because of a ""technical malfunction"" during routine maintenance, giving its version of events after Pakistan summoned India's envoy to protest.  Military experts have in the past warned of the risk of accidents or miscalculations by the nuclear-armed neighbors, which have fought three wars and engaged in numerous smaller armed clashes, usually over the disputed territory of Kashmir.  Tensions have eased in recent months, and the incident, which may have been the first of its kind, immediately raised questions about safety mechanisms.  ""On 9 March 2022, in the course of a routine maintenance, a technical malfunction led to the accidental firing of a missile,"" the Indian Ministry of Defence said in a three-paragraph statement.  ""It is learnt that the missile landed in an area of Pakistan. While the incident is deeply regrettable, it is also a matter of relief that there has been no loss of life due to the accident.""  The ministry said the government had ""taken a serious view and ordered a high-level Court of Enquiry"".  Pakistani officials said the missile was unarmed and had crashed near the country's eastern city of Mian Channu, about 500 km (310 miles) from capital Islamabad.  Pakistan's foreign office summoned India's charge d'affaires in Islamabad to lodge a protest over what it called an unprovoked violation of its airspace, saying the incident could have endangered passenger flights and civilian lives.  Pakistan warned India ""to be mindful of the unpleasant consequences of such negligence and take effective measures to avoid the recurrence of such violations in future"".  Ayesha Siddiqa, an expert on military affairs and South Asian matters, tweeted that ""India-Pak should be talking about risk mitigation"".  ""Both states have remained confident about control of nuclear weapons but what if such accidents happen again & with more serious consequences?""  One senior Pakistani security official told Reuters, on the condition of anonymity, that the incident had raised alarm and could have escalated into a ""critical untoward situation"".  ""The admission that it was a missile was very nonchalant,"" he said. ""What does this say about their safety mechanisms and the technical prowess of very dangerous weapons? The international community needs to have a very close look at this.""  The official said it was possibly a BrahMos missile – a nuclear-capable, land-attack cruise missile jointly developed by Russia and India.  According to the U.S.-based Arms Control Association, the missile's range is between 300 km (186 miles) and 500 km (310 miles), making it capable of hitting Islamabad from a northern Indian launch pad.  The Pakistani official wondered if the incident meant that India had ""missiles in ready-to-launch positions and pointed at Pakistan, and that too without any safeguard of a command and control system"".  A Pakistani military spokesman told a news conference on Thursday evening that a ""high-speed flying object"" originating from the northern Indian city of Sirsa had crashed in eastern Pakistan.  ""The flight path of this object endangered many national and international passenger flights both in Indian and Pakistani airspace as well as human life and property on ground,"" he said.  A Pakistan air force official said the object, flying at 40,000 feet and three times the speed of sound, had flown 124 km (77 miles) in Pakistani airspace.  Happymon Jacob, a professor of international studies at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said both sides had handled the situation well.  ""It gives me great hope that the 2 nuclear weapon states dealt with the missile incident in a mature manner,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""New Delhi should offer to pay compensation for the Pak house that was destroyed."" "
Ackman’s Pershing Square is back at Canadian Pacific. Here's what's ahead,2022-03-12 14:33:53+00:00,"Business: Canadian Pacific owns and operates a transcontinental freight railway in Canada and the United States. The company transports bulk commodities, including grain, coal, potash, fertilizers, and sulfur. It also moves merchandise freight, such as energy, chemicals and plastics, metals, minerals, and consumer, automotive, and forest products. Further, Canadian Pacific also transports intermodal traffic comprising retail goods in overseas containers. The company offers rail and intermodal transportation services through a network of approximately 13,000 miles serving business centers in Quebec and British Columbia, Canada; and the United States Northeast and Midwest regions. Through its merger with Kansas City Southern, Canadian Pacific will now have access into Mexico, creating the first single-line rail network that links the U.S., Mexico and Canada.  Stock Market Value: $72.3B ($77.63 per share)  Percentage Ownership:  1.59%  Average Cost: n/a  Activist Commentary: Pershing Square, managed by Bill Ackman, is a very well respected and successful activist. While the firm does not take a lot of activist positions relative to other activists, the positions it does take are generally large, well-conceived and fully committed. Pershing Square typically looks for the following: (i) a high-quality business, (ii) simple, predictable, cash flow generative, durable growth concept and (iii) a business where there is an opportunity to be a catalyst. Pershing Square previously had a well-publicized activist campaign at Canadian Pacific between 2011 and 2016, making a return of 153.30% on their 13D situation versus 70.13% for the S&P 500.  On March 7, Pershing Square announced a new position in Canadian Pacific.  Pershing Square previously filed a 13D on Canadian Pacific on Oct. 28, 2011, and that became one of the most successful and significant activist campaigns of the past 20 years. There are three major elements of an activist campaign: (i) developing a plan to create value, (ii) getting into a position to implement that plan and (iii) successfully executing that plan. Pershing Square impressed on all accounts. They developed a plan to replace the CEO with Hunter Harrison, the ""Michael Jordan"" of railroad CEOs. They fought a long and hard proxy fight with a very high degree of difficulty at the time and ultimately replaced most of the board. Further, the execution of the plan went either as expected or better than expected, creating significant value for shareholders. Pershing Square reluctantly exited this investment with a 153% return in 2016 when the stock was trading at $27.28 per share (split adjusted) due to a slew of redemption requests related to other Pershing Square investments.   Their fingerprints are all over the present company. They have since been watching Canadian Pacific, looking for a good entry point for investment, which never came as the company's stock went almost straight up since then. The opportunity now presented itself in the form of the Canadian Pacific/Kansas City Southern merger. While the acquisition has closed, the merger is still subject to final approval by the Surface Transportation Board, which is expected to be received by the fourth quarter of 2022.  On a standalone basis, Canadian Pacific has been doing very well, with Hunter Harrison mentee Keith Creel at the helm since Harrison's departure. Creel has done, and continues to do, an amazing job growing the company and running it efficiently. Canadian Pacific's merger with KCS will create the only railroad that travels between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada and create opportunities for revenue growth and on the efficiency side. With respect to efficiency, Creel can apply the same discipline he and Hunter Harrison applied at CP to optimize the operations of KCS.    But the better opportunity is on the revenue side. Most importantly, having a single railroad that can efficiently move goods from Canada all the way to Mexico is a huge advantage in attracting customers. But there are also several other tailwinds that have been highlighted and magnified by the present war in Ukraine. First, the United States is making a push to improve its infrastructure, which should lead to more transportation of goods throughout the country. Second, with gas at historically high levels, companies are going to be looking for the cheapest way to ship their goods. Third, North American companies have already been losing their willingness to rely on China as a distribution partner and are looking to keep their supply chain closer to home. The war in Ukraine and the possibility of China moving on Taiwan in the future has greatly elevated this concern.  Additionally, there is an ESG benefit here as railroads are an energy efficient way to transport goods. According to the association of American Railroads, using 50 rail cars to ship food from California to Ohio instead of trucks would take 126 trucks off the road and eliminate 391.5 tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere if trucks were used.  We expect Canadian Pacific 2.0 to be a very different situation compared to the first time around. Bill Ackman likes this CEO. In fact, he is somewhat responsible for him being there. This will be very amicable and if Pershing Square does take a board seat here, it will be to support management as a long-term investor in a large investment for them. When you have the premier management team in an industry, you want to add assets and revenue to it. That is exactly what Pershing Square sees happening at Canadian Pacific.  Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.

"Deutsche Bank reverses course on Russia, says it will unwind business there",2022-03-12 01:18:50+00:00,"Deutsche Bank said Friday that it was winding down its operations in Russia, one day after its chief financial officer said it wasn't ""practical"" to shutter the unit.   ""Like some international peers and in line with our legal regulatory obligations, we are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" Dylan Riddle, a U.S.-based spokesperson for the German bank, said in an email.   ""There won't be any new business in Russia,"" he said.

Kim Kardashian's advice to women in business is getting major backlash,2022-03-23 09:51:06+00:00,"Kim Kardashian is on the receiving end of some heavy criticism this week after dishing out some eye-popping advice to women, with one career coach telling CNBC her comments potentially send a ""dangerous"" message to younger followers.  Kardashian had this guidance for women in business in an interview with Variety released on Wednesday: ""Get your f---ing ass up and work. It seems like nobody wants to work these days.""  Unsurprisingly, it sparked a storm on social media, with Twitter users criticizing Kardashian for her ""tone deaf"" comments.  Actress Jameela Jamil weighed in on the comments, tweeting: ""I think if you grew up in Beverly Hills with super successful parents in what was simply a smaller mansion … nobody needs to hear your thoughts on success/work ethic.""  Jamil added: ""This same 24 hours in the day sh-t is a nightmare. 99.9% of the world grew up with a VERY different 24 hours.""  And Twitter users were quick to draw comparisons between Kardashian's advice and comments made by Britain's ""Love Island"" star Molly-Mae Hague in a podcast interview.  A clip of Hague's interview on The Diary of a CEO podcast in December resurfaced a month later and quickly went viral. In the clip, the Brit doubled down on the argument that ""Beyonce has the same 24 hours in a day that we do.""  Hague said: ""When I've spoken about that before in the past I have been slammed a little bit with people saying 'it's easy for you to say that … you've not grown up in poverty, you've not grown up with major money struggles so for you to sit there and say that we have the same 24 hours in a day it's not correct.' But technically what I'm saying is correct, we do.""  Hague, who was a runner-up on the popular reality TV show ""Love Island,"" was named creative director of clothing brand Pretty Little Thing in August and reportedly earns six-figures (in British pounds) a month in her role.  Meanwhile, Kardashian is said to have a net worth of $1.8 billion, according to Forbes. On the back of the success of the reality TV show ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" Kim and her family, have amassed their fortunes by creating an empire of retail brands.  Indeed, the very name of the show is a twist on that classic American dream message of ""keeping up with the Joneses.""  And so it's understandable that people look to emulate that success. However, one career coach suggests that both Kardashian and Hague's comments could add to harmful social media messages on work ethic.  Emma Harrison, a freelance careers coach, told CNBC that both Hague and Kardashian have ""demonstrated ignorance of lived experience of the 99% and their messages pose real danger to their followers, especially those who are younger and more easily influenced.""  Harrison, a senior lecturer in careers, guidance and counselling at Canterbury Christ Church University in the U.K., noted that there had been a rise in influencers giving advice over social media, which was closely linked to messages of ""toxic positivity"" already present on these platforms.  ""This idea that a person's mindset can change everything or is the only thing holding them back is toxic and unhelpful in the same way that Kim Kardashian, Molly-Mae [Hague] and countless other influencer messages are,"" she said.  CNBC contacted Kim Kardashian's publicist Tracy Romulus, as well as Molly-Mae Hague's manager Francesca Britton, and is yet to response a response.  Kat Hutchings, a leadership and career coach who runs her own firm, told CNBC that ""looking to people at the pinnacle of their career/success or have [Instagram] fame or celebrity status can create a feeling that we'll never get there.""  In addition, she said it could also make people feel as if ""we need to be someone other than ourselves in order to achieve"" success.  Hutchings recommended seeking out role models who are two to five years ahead in their career and who remember what it was like to be in your shoes: ""Their advice is helpful, relevant and actionable.""  She said that the people we admire in our career should also remind us that ""having a vision and aspiration is important, but what's more important is taking small steps every day towards what we want.""  Hutchings added that people should be able to be ""less distracted by the glamour of someone operating in a wholly different context to us and [be] able to filter for the expertise and advice that helps us move forward.""

Kevin O'Leary: 20% of my portfolio is in crypto,2022-03-12 05:29:15+00:00,"Celebrity investor Kevin O'Leary told CNBC on Friday that one-fifth of his investment holdings are tied up in cryptocurrencies and companies operating in the nascent digital asset industry.  ""I have millions of dollars, 20% of my portfolio is now in cryptocurrencies and blockchain,"" O'Leary said in an interview on ""Squawk Box."" Blockchains are the distributed digital ledgers on which cryptocurrencies run.  Cryptocurrencies have attracted considerable attention and investment in recent years, including from large institutions and high-profile figures like hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones and fund manager Bill Miller. Many tout bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, as a long-term store of value. There's a raft of other, smaller digital tokens, too.  Crypto backers say it remains early earnings for the industry — bitcoin itself has only been around since January 2009. Still, crypto startups are attracting billions of dollars of venture capital.  At the same time, the burgeoning asset class remains volatile, and regulators like Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler have warned about its ""highly speculative"" nature and the lack of investor protection. The outgoing chair of the U.K.'s financial regulator also has warned about pump-and-dump schemes in certain digital tokens.  Among crypto's detractors, billionaire businessman Charlie Munger, a longtime partner of Warren Buffett and a Berkshire Hathaway vice chair, has also been critical of digital currencies and their volatility. In February, he said he wishes the U.S. had banned them. Buffett is no fan either, calling bitcoin in 2018 ""rat poison squared."" Others have likened bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme.  Five months in, bitcoin ETFs are down big but showing signs of staying power  Jim Chanos reveals new short position in crypto exchange Coinbase  Jeffrey Gundlach says he would buy bitcoin over gold in the short term  Asked by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin whether some cryptocurrencies will not even be around in a decade, O'Leary said he's taken that risk factor into consideration.  ""You have to be diversified. I own 32 different positions, including equity FTX itself,"" O'Leary said while disclosing he's a paid spokesperson for the cryptocurrency exchange, founded by 30-year-old billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.  ""The whole point is, you don't know who is going to win. Is Ethereum going to win? Is solana going to win? Is it Helium or is it Avalanche? I own them all,"" said O'Leary, who is a co-host of ""Shark Tank"" and makes other venture capital investments. He's also the founder and chairman of O'Shares ETFs.  O'Leary's comments Friday come two days after President Joe Biden signed an executive order that directs the U.S. government to analyze the cryptocurrency industry. The administration says the order's goal is to both address risks while ""harnessing the potential benefits of digital assets and their underlying technology.""    ""It wasn't an all out ban, so that's good news,"" O'Leary said. However, he expressed concerns about the way Biden's directive includes an emphasis on climate risks associated with cryptocurrency.  The act of mining bitcoin — which, in practice means running computers to verify transactions across the blockchain network — requires a lot of power. As a result, critics have lamented the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining.  O'Leary said he's invested in at least one private bitcoin mining facility.

Biden calls for an end to Russia's 'most favored nation' trade status,2022-03-11 18:30:22+00:00,"President Joe Biden on Friday called for the U.S. to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" status, which would downgrade Russia as a trading partner and open the door to damaging new tariffs on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.  The European Union and the Group of Seven nations are expected to take the same steps, Biden said. Canada already removed Russia's most favored nation status last week.  Biden signed an executive order Friday banning the import of Russian seafood, non-industrial diamonds and liquor to the United States.  The order also prohibits the export or sale of American luxury goods to anyone located in Russia. This includes high-end watches and clothes, jewelry, top-shelf liquor and luxury vehicles — all of which feature prominently in the lifestyles of mega-rich Russian oligarchs.  Speaking at the White House, Biden repeatedly singled out Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rules the country as an autocrat.  ""Putin is the aggressor,"" said Biden. ""And Putin must pay the price.""  Friday was the 16th day of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and reports from the ground indicated that Russian forces had increased their artillery attacks on civilian targets.  Despite its military superiority, Russia has so far failed to take its two primary targets, the city of Kharkiv and the capital Kyiv.  ""Putin's war against Ukraine will never be a victory,"" Biden said. ""He hoped to dominate Ukraine without a fight, he failed. He hoped to fracture European resolve, he failed.""  ""He hoped to weaken the transatlantic alliance, he failed. He hoped to split apart American democracy, in terms of our positions. He failed,"" said Biden.  Following Biden's remarks, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced that the House intends to pass legislation next week to revoke Russia's MFN status.  The Senate, likewise, is moving forward with a bill. ""We're working on an agreement that the Senate can pass quickly,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Friday.  Both Republicans and Democrats have strongly endorsed Biden's non-military efforts to punish Russia and some have already proposed legislation to revoke Russia's WTO membership.   Biden's announcement marked the latest push by the U.S. and dozens of other countries to ratchet up their unprecedented efforts to isolate and undermine Russia's economy.  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine directly asked Congress last weekend to revoke Russia's most favored nation status.  Earlier this week Biden signed an executive order banning Russian oil imports. The U.S., EU and NATO countries have also imposed sanctions on Russian businesses, members of its elite oligarch class and even Putin himself.  Hundreds of major corporations have voluntarily pulled their businesses out of the country.  If Russia's trade status is revoked, the Biden administration and Congress will be able to impose taxes on any goods Russia exports to the U.S.  Russia was the U.S.' 26th-largest trading partner in 2019, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Russian exports to the U.S. in 2021 totaled $29 billion, the majority of which comprised oil and gas products. "
Trump loses bid to countersue rape accuser E. Jean Carroll,2022-03-11 19:31:32+00:00,"Former President Donald Trump on Friday lost his effort to be allowed to countersue and seek financial damages from the writer E. Jean Carroll, who accuses him of raping her years ago in a New York City department store.  In his scathing decision rejecting Trump's effort, Manhattan federal court Judge Lewis Kaplan said there is good reason to believe that the request is a delaying tactic by the former president to further stall Carroll's defamation lawsuit against him.  Kaplan wrote that the request smacks of ""bad faith"" by Trump, who waited 14 months to seek permission to answer Carroll's claims with a countersuit alleging harassment and arguing that she is making ""baseless"" accusations.  The judge said that delaying the case further would prejudice Carroll's right to have her claims tried in court.  He also said that even if Trump were allowed to countersue, proving his claims in court would be ""futile.""  ""The record convinces this Court that the defendant's litigation tactics, whatever their intent, have delayed the case to an extent that readily could have been far less,"" Kaplan wrote.  The decision comes as the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit is considering an appeal by Trump and the U.S. Justice Department of an earlier ruling by Kaplan, who barred the U.S. government from replacing Trump as the defendant in Carroll's lawsuit.  If the Justice Department wins that argument, which is based on the fact that Trump was president and not a private citizen when he made the allegedly defamatory claims about Carroll, it would effectively end her case.  That is because the U.S. government could then invoke its protection from lawsuits on the ground of sovereign immunity.  Carroll sued Trump for defamation in November 2019 after he claimed she was lying, and motivated by money and a political agenda, when she accused him of sexual assault. She wrote in a New York magazine article in June that year that Trump had raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room after a chance encounter in that store in the mid-1990s.  Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan, in an emailed statement about Friday's decision, said, ""As the Court said in its opinion today: a 'characterization of [Donald Trump's] previous and threatened future actions as dilatory, in bad faith or unduly prejudicial would be a bootless exercise. They are, in varying degrees, all three.'""  ''Judge Kaplan further noted that this case 'could have been tried and decided — one way or the other — long ago.' My client E. Jean Carroll and I could not agree more,"" said the attorney Kaplan, who is not related to the judge.  Trump's lawyer Alina Habba said in an email, ""While we are disappointed with the Court's decision today, we eagerly look forward to litigating this action and proving at trial that the plaintiff's claims have absolutely no basis in law or in fact.""  Carroll's case was originally filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, a trial-level court in the New York state judicial system.  Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:  The Justice Department, while Trump was still in office, waited for 10 months before seeking to have the case transferred to U.S. District Court in Manhattan, a federal court, and asking to substitute the government for Trump as a defendant.  The move came a month after a state judge rejected Trump's claim that he is immune from a private lawsuit, setting the stage for him to be required to submit a DNA sample that could be compared to a stain on Carroll's dress, which she had saved from that day, and be compelled to answer questions under oath.  Judge Kaplan promptly barred the Justice Department from having Trump removed as the defendant.  ""The President of the United States is not an employee of the Government within the meaning of the relevant statutes,"" Kaplan wrote in October 2020.  ""Even if he were such an employee, President Trump's allegedly defamatory statements concerning Ms. Carroll would not have been within the scope of his employment,"" Kaplan wrote that month.  The Biden administration, to the surprise of some legal observers, persisted in the appeal of Kaplan's ruling that first was filed by the Justice Department under the Trump administration. "
Russians liquidating crypto in the UAE to seek safe havens,2022-03-11 16:06:26+00:00,"Crypto firms in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are being deluged with requests to liquidate billions of dollars of virtual currency as Russians seek a safe haven for their fortunes, company executives and financial sources said.  Some clients are using cryptocurrency to invest in real estate in the UAE, while others want to use firms there to turn their virtual money into hard currency and stash it elsewhere, the sources said.  One crypto firm has received lots of queries in the past 10 days from Swiss brokers asking to liquidate billions of dollars of bitcoin because their clients are afraid Switzerland will freeze their assets, one executive said, adding that none of the requests had been for less than $2 billion.  ""We've had like five or six in the past two weeks. None of them have come off yet – they've sort of fallen over at the last minute, which is not rare - but we've never had this much interest,"" the executive said, adding that his firm normally receives an inquiry for a large transaction once a month.  ""We have one guy – I don't know who he is, but he came through a broker – and they're like, 'we want to sell 125,000 bitcoin'. And I'm like, 'what? That's $6 billion guys'. And they're like, 'yeah, we're going to send it to a company in Australia',"" the executive said.  Dubai, the Gulf's financial and business centre and a growing crypto hub, has long been a magnet for the world's ultra-rich and the UAE's refusal to take sides between Western allies and Moscow has signalled to Russians that their money is safe there.  One real estate broker, whose company has partnered with a cryptocurrency service to help people buy property, said: ""We've been seeing a lot of Russians and even Belarusians coming to Dubai and bringing whatever they can bring, even in crypto.""  A financial source in the UAE confirmed that Russians were buying property in Dubai, using crypto as a way of getting their money out of other jurisdictions and into the Gulf state.  Cryptocurrency exchanges have said, while giving few details, that they are blocking the accounts of Russians sanctioned by the West over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special operation.""   Major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance say they are taking steps to ensure that crypto is not used as a vehicle to evade sanctions, and that they collaborate with law enforcement on the issue.  Still, as crypto offers users a high degree of anonymity, European countries such as Germany and Estonia have this week called for tighter oversight to snuff out any loopholes that could allow sanctions busting.  Three Western diplomats said they were increasingly alarmed by the number of Russians who in recent weeks were seeking a refuge in the UAE for their fortunes, including in property, and were wary that some could be acting on behalf of those under sanctions.  Two of the diplomats said they were sceptical that the UAE would crack down on Russian wealth in the Gulf state, which they said was predominantly held in Dubai, citing the country's neutral stance in the conflict.  A third said they hoped the UAE, which is also a gold trading hub, understood the implications for its reputation and would take action.  The UAE was put on a ""grey list"" this month for increased monitoring by financial crime and money laundering watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  The FATF cited risks in certain industries, including real estate agents and precious metals dealers. Dubai adopted a virtual assets law this week and established a regulator. The UAE's regulator said it was close to issuing regulations and has consulted on money laundering risks in the sector.  The Dubai government's media office and the UAE central bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The UAE's Foreign Ministry said it had no further comment beyond previous statements that the government has a ""strong commitment"" to working with FATF on areas for improvement in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime.  Some experts say the relative transparency of cryptocurrency transactions, which are recorded on the blockchain ledger that underpins bitcoin and other tokens, makes large-scale sanctions evasion difficult.  The U.S. Treasury said on Monday that sanctions-busting using crypto was ""not necessarily practicable"", and called for vigilance from companies in the industry.  Two sources familiar with the matter said UAE companies had reputational concerns about doing business with Russians, but felt the state's abstention at the U.N. Security Council, when Russia vetoed a resolution condemning its invasion of Ukraine, was a signal they should not impose restrictions on Russians.  The UAE, which has deepened ties with Russia over the years, has not matched sanctions imposed by Western nations and its central bank has not issued any guidance regarding the measures.  Dubai, an attractive tourism destination, has long been popular with Russians, who were among the top visitors and purchasers of real estate even before the war and ensuing sanctions threw the Russian economy into turmoil.  Apurv Trivedi of Healy Consultants, which advises on setting up businesses, including crypto companies, said they had definitely been getting more interest from Russian clients.  ""They're basically trying to protect themselves against the inflationary pressures that are happening against the Russian currency. So crypto has been a very good exit for them to manage the risks that they're facing,"" Trivedi said. ""It's a good liquidity provider for them.""  Healy's Sami Fadlallah said a lot of the money coming from Russia has been moving into Dubai's real estate, citing both industry talk and their company's experience.  ""People parking their money in dozens of apartments in the Marina, Downtown,"" Fadlallah said.  ""We've seen a lot of Russians hedging their bets against the devaluation of the rouble by moving a lot of assets into crypto. And the UAE is relatively loose in terms of its regulation and authorities over transferring crypto here."" "
"China is 'deeply' worried about Ukraine crisis, Premier Li Keqiang says",2022-03-11 08:30:51+00:00,"BEIJING — China is ""deeply"" worried about the crisis in Ukraine, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday, warning that sanctions will hurt global growth.  ""On Ukraine, indeed the current situation there is grave, and China is deeply concerned and grieved,"" Li said in Mandarin, according to an official translation.  The premier was responding to two questions about the Ukraine war at the beginning of an annual press briefing. Since Russia's attack on Ukraine about two weeks ago, Beijing has refused to call it an invasion and said China would maintain normal trade with both countries, without joining in on U.S., EU and other countries' sanctions on Russia.  On Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said relations with Russia were ""rock solid."" He pointed to a joint statement with Russia issued after a high-level meeting in early February between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.  During the Friday briefing, Li maintained that China has ""followed an independent policy of peace"" and repeated Beijing's line of encouraging Russia and Ukraine to negotiate. ""The pressing task now is preventing tensions from escalating or even getting out of control.""  Li did not specifically say whether China would economically support Russia, but noted China supports ""all efforts that are conducive to a peaceful resolution of the crisis.""  He added that the sanctions would only shock a world economy already struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.  Over the weekend, the International Monetary Fund said the economic consequences of the war are ""already very serious"" with ""adverse"" shocks to inflation and business activity in many countries.  Last week, Oxford Economics estimated the war would reduce global GDP by 0.2%, with a decline of 0.6% this year if the fighting persists through 2023.  Li was speaking Friday at a press briefing held at the close of an annual parliamentary meeting.  This year marks Li's final appearance at the briefing as premier, a position he's held since 2013. The ruling Chinese Communist Party is set in the fall to select a new leadership team, although President Xi Jinping is expected to stay on for an unprecedented third term.  Li closed the roughly two-hour-long briefing with a pledge that China would continue to open up its economy regardless of changes in the international environment.  Morgan Stanley says these Chinese stocks could rebound — Alibaba, Tencent aren't on the list  Wall Street banks name their favorite Asia stocks — and Citi says one could have upside of 167%  Xpeng and more: Morgan Stanley says these stocks will benefit from rising oil prices  Foreign businesses have long complained about requirements of forced tech transfers and unequal access to the Chinese market, especially at a local implementation level. In the last few years, China has passed a law for improving the business environment and allowed foreign financial institutions full ownership of their local operations.  ""It has been forty years since China has gotten on the journey of opening up,"" Li said. ""Opening up has brought benefits to the country and its people. We will not and must not close this door of opportunity. Thank you."" "
"As Russia nears a debt default, talk now turns to global contagion",2022-03-15 08:03:54+00:00,"Russia is on the brink of defaulting on its debt, according to ratings agencies and international bodies, but economists do not yet see a global contagion effect on the horizon.  International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Sunday that sanctions imposed by western governments on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine would trigger a sharp recession this year. She added that the IMF no longer sees Russian sovereign debt default as an ""improbable event.""  Her warning followed that of World Bank Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart, who cautioned last week that Russia and ally Belarus were ""mightily close"" to defaulting on debt repayments.  Despite the high risk of default, however, the IMF's Georgieva told CBS that a wider financial crisis in the event of a Russian default was unlikely for now, deeming global banks' $120 billion exposure to Russia ""not systematically relevant.""  The Russian state has a host of key payment dates coming up, the first of which is a $117 million payment of some U.S. dollar-denominated eurobond coupons on Wednesday.  Credit ratings agency Fitch last week downgraded Russian sovereign debt to a ""C"" rating, indicating that ""a sovereign default is imminent.""  S&P Global Ratings also downgraded Russia's foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings to ""CCC-"" on the basis that the measures taken by Moscow to mitigate the unprecedented barrage of sanctions imposed by the U.S. and allies ""will likely substantially increase the risk of default.""  ""Russia's military conflict with Ukraine has prompted a new round of G7 government sanctions, including ones targeting the foreign exchange reserves of The Central Bank of Russia (CBR); this has rendered a large part of these reserves inaccessible, undermining the CBR's ability to act as a lender of last resort and impairing what had been – until recently – Russia's standout credit strength: its net external liquidity position,"" S&P said.  Moody's also slashed Russia's credit rating earlier this month to its second-lowest tier, citing the same central bank capital controls likely to hinder payments in foreign currencies, resulting in defaults.  Moscow moved to strengthen its financial position following a suite of western sanctions imposed in 2014, in response to its annexation of Crimea. The government ran consistent budget surpluses and sought to scale back both its debts and its reliance on the U.S. dollar.  The accumulation of substantial foreign exchange reserves was intended to mitigate against the depreciation of local assets, but reserves of dollars and euros have been effectively frozen by recent sanctions. Meanwhile, the Russian ruble has plunged to all-time lows.  ""To mitigate the resulting high exchange rate and financial market volatility, and to preserve remaining foreign currency buffers, Russia's authorities have – among other steps – introduced capital-control measures that we understand could constrain nonresident government bondholders from receiving interest and principal payments on time,"" S&P added.  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Monday that Russia will use its reserves of Chinese yuan to pay Wednesday's coupon on a sovereign eurobond issue in foreign currency.  Alternatively, Siluanov suggested the payment could be made in rubles if the payment request is rebuffed by western banks, a move Moscow would view as fulfilling its foreign debt obligations.  Although any defaults on upcoming payments would be symbolic – since Russia has not defaulted since 1998 – Deutsche Bank economists noted that nonpayments will likely begin a 30-day grace period granted to issuers before defaults are officially triggered.  ""Thirty days still gives time for there to be a negotiated end to the war and therefore this probably isn't yet the moment where we see where the full stresses in the financial system might reside,"" Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank's global head of credit strategy, said in an email Monday.  ""There has already been a huge mark to market loss anyway with news coming through or write downs. However, this is clearly an important story to watch.""  Trading in Russian debt has largely shut down since the web of sanctions on central banks and financial institutions was imposed, with government restrictions and actions taken by investors and clearing exchanges freezing most positions.  Ashok Bhatia, deputy chief investment officer for fixed income at Neuberger Berman, said in a recent note that investors will be unable to access any liquidity in Russian assets for some time. Bhatia added that prices for Russian government securities are now pricing in a default scenario, which Neuberger Berman strategists think is a likely outcome.  ""It's unclear why Russia would want to use hard currency to repay these securities at the moment, and we expect much of this debt to enter 'grace periods' over the coming month,"" he said.  ""Russian hard currency sovereign securities are indicated at 10 – 30 cents on the dollar and will likely remain there.""  Bhatia suggested that the key macroeconomic risk arising from the conflict in Ukraine is energy prices, but the spillover pressure to global credit markets will be ""relatively muted"" with recent volatility across asset classes continuing.  ""But given that Russian securities have been repriced to default levels, we believe those immediate impacts are largely over,"" he said.  ""Debates about the economic impacts and central bank responses will now become front and center."" "
"Russia-Ukraine war updates for Monday, March 14",2022-03-15 11:48:15+00:00,"This has been CNBC's live blog covering updates on the war in Ukraine. [Follow the latest updates here.]   Russia and Ukraine resumed talks via video link on Monday morning.  The negotiations wrapped later in the day, and they were expected to start up again Tuesday.   An official taking part in the talks said Ukraine's objectives were to secure a cease-fire, the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and security guarantees.  The discussions come after a Russian shelling attack on a residential building in Kyiv's Obolon district killed two civilians and injured three, according to Ukrainian authorities.  An anti-war protester interrupted a live news bulletin on Russia's state TV Channel One on Monday, holding up a sign behind the studio presenter and shouting slogans denouncing the war in Ukraine.  The sign, in English and Russian, read: ""NO WAR. Stop the war. Don't believe propaganda. They are lying to you here."" Another phrase, which looked like ""Russians against war"", was partly obscured.  The extraordinary act of dissent took place on day 19 of the war which began when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it calls a special military operation.  —Reuters  On Monday, U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan met in Rome with Yang Jiechi, director of the foreign affairs office for the Chinese Communist Party's central committee, according to official statements.  The two sides had a ""candid, in-depth and constructive communication"" on bilateral relations, as well as international and regional issues of mutual concern, according to a state media report. This readout focused on China-U.S. relations, while mentioning Ukraine as a topic of discussion.  In a separate readout that focused on Ukraine, Yang repeated Beijing's position that the situation in Ukraine has reached a point that China does not want to see.  He said the international community should push for negotiations that cool the down the situation as soon as possible, the report said.  — Evelyn Cheng  NATO leaders are discussing holding an extraordinary meeting in Brussels late next week, according to U.S. and foreign officials, which President Joe Biden and other heads of state would attend, CNBC's Kayla Tausche reported.   The planning has not yet been finalized, the officials added.  —Riya Bhattacharjee  Photos show the aftermath of bombing in Okhtyrka, a city in eastern Ukraine.  Talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials will restart Tuesday, a member of Kyiv's delegation said.   ""A technical pause has been taken in the negotiations until tomorrow,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wrote in a tweet after Monday's negotiations between the sides. ""For additional work in the working subgroups and clarification of individual definitions. Negotiations continue...""  Even as the two countries carry out talks, Russia has continued its destructive assault on its neighbor.   — Jacob Pramuk  The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite ended Monday's trading session with losses. The broad-market index slid by less than 1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained one point to close at 32,945.  Bond yields also leapt on Monday, as investors prepared for the Federal Reserve's key meeting Wednesday. The central bank is expected to announce its first interest rate hike since Dec. 2018. The 10-year Treasury jumped to just over 2%, the highest level since July 2019.  U.S. crude oil, which jumped as high as $130 last week, slumped on Monday. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell by more than 8% to trade at $99.76 per barrel at the lows of the day. The international benchmark Brent crude also slumped 8% to $103.68 a barrel. Ultimately, both oil benchmarks trimmed their losses, with WTI settling 5.78% lower at $103.68. Brent ended the session at $106.90, down 5.1%.  — Darla Mercado  Putin's invasion of Ukraine will set the Russian economy back 30 years and erase decades of gains made in moving its citizens into the global middle class, experts told CNBC this week.  After decades of opening its economy to the West, the recent exodus from Russia of global brands will trigger a profound shift in how middle-class citizens make and spend their money.  As the country’s economy collapses under the weight of unprecedented international sanctions, the ruble has lost around 40% of its value against the dollar.  This economic fallout could also create domestic political problems for President Vladimir Putin.  Experts believe the standard of living in Russia will plummet in the next five years, raising questions about whether voters will become disillusioned enough with Putin to challenge his absolute authority.  — Christina Wilkie  National security adviser Jake Sullivan discussed Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Rome on Monday.  The U.S. delegation underscored the ""importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the United States and China,"" according to a White House summary of the meeting.  The high-stakes discussion, which included officials from the National Security Council and State Department, follows warnings from Washington that Beijing should not alleviate any economic pressure mounting on Moscow.  — Amanda Macias  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan did not rule out buying additional Russian weapons despite Moscow's war in Ukraine.  Erdogan, who spoke alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said Ankara would continue to meet its NATO commitments to Ukraine but that it would be ""premature"" to cancel future weapons agreements with Russia.  ""Under the current circumstances, it would be premature to talk about what the future shows right now. We have to see what the conditions bring,"" Erdogan said on Monday. ""We have to maintain our friendship with Mr. Zelenskyy and Mr. Putin,"" he added.  In 2017, Erdogan brokered with Russian President Vladimir Putin a reported $2.5 billion deal for the S-400 missile system. The S-400, a mobile surface-to-air missile system, is said to pose a risk to the NATO alliance as well as the F-35 aircraft, America's most expensive weapons platform.  Despite warnings from the United States and other NATO allies, Turkey accepted the first of four missile batteries in July 2019. The Trump administration cut Turkey, a financial and manufacturing partner, from the F-35 program and imposed sanctions on the NATO ally.  — Amanda Macias  European Union member states agreed on a fourth sanctions package against Russia, the office of the French EU presidency wrote on Twitter on Monday.  In a three-part tweet, the French presidency also wrote that Russia's ""most-favored nation"" trade status with the World Trade Organization would be revoked. Other details of the sanctions were not disclosed.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has previously said the EU was working to suspend Russia's membership rights of leading multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.  — Amanda Macias  The White House is considering a presidential trip to Europe in the coming weeks, multiple outlets reported Monday, citing anonymous sources.  A visit by President Joe Biden would amplify the effort to shore up American alliances in Europe as Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine escalates.  Since the start of Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine in late February, Biden has played a leading role in marshaling NATO allies and G-7 countries to counter Russian President Vladimir Putin using a combination of economic sanctions and military deterrence.  If he were to visit Europe, Biden would likely visit Brussels, the capital of the European Union and the location of NATO headquarters, NBC News reported.  — Christina Wilkie  The Pentagon is watching whether China supplies arms to Russia as Moscow continues its assault on Ukraine, a senior U.S. Defense official said.   ""If China does choose to materially support Russia in this war, there will likely be consequences for China in that regard,"" the official said on a call with reporters on Monday.  The official's comments come as national security advisor Jake Sullivan meets with China's top diplomat in Rome.  ""We have seen China basically give tacit approval to what Russia is doing by refusing to join sanctions by blaming the West and the United States for the assistance we've given Ukraine and by claiming they wanted to see a peaceful outcome but essentially doing nothing to achieve it,"" the official added.  — Amanda Macias  After 19 days of war in Ukraine, the Kremlin has approximately 90% of its devoted combat power still available for the fight, according to the Pentagon's latest assessment.  Almost all of Russia's deployed assets, including armored vehicles and munitions, have survived the conflict, a senior Defense official said on Monday.  ""The Russians still have a lot of capability. We would assess their available combat power as just under 90%. So they have an awful lot remaining,"" the official said.  The official declined to comment on Ukraine's combat power.  – Amanda Macias  Russian forces have launched more than 900 missiles since the start of the Ukraine invasion, a senior U.S. Defense official said Monday.  The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Russian arsenal includes short-range, medium-range, ballistic and cruise missiles.  Since Moscow invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the Pentagon has observed a steady rise in missile launches amid stalled ground movements, the official said.  — Amanda Macias  A large Russian military convoy, widely tracked by satellite imagery, appears to be stalled on its route to Kyiv.  ""We still hold that it's stalled and they have not made any significant progress in unsticking it,"" a senior U.S. Defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said on a call with reporters on Monday.  The Russian convoy appears to have made little progress for days, according to U.S. assessments. Last week, the official told reporters that ""the convoy is not really going anywhere,"" when asked about the latest satellite imagery provided by Maxar Technologies.  It is not immediately clear how many vehicles are in the Russian convoy.  — Amanda Macias  Russian forces did not make significant progress in their advance on Kyiv over the weekend, a senior U.S. Defense official said Monday.  Russian troops are approximately 15 kilometers or 10 miles away from Kyiv's city center, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to share new details from a Pentagon assessment.  ""Almost all of Russia's advances remain stalled,"" the official said, adding that the Pentagon still believes that Russian forces intend to encircle Kyiv.  — Amanda Macias  The United Kingdom's representative to the United Nations slammed Russia for ""tearing up the rule book"" during a UN Security Council meeting Monday.  ""For decades, the OSCE has worked to bring security to Europe and yet we meet today in the middle of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,"" said Barbara Woodward, the permanent representative of United Kingdom to the UN, referencing the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  ""One OSCE signatory tearing up the rulebook and pursuing war against another,"" Woodward added, referencing Russia's agreement to the security organization.  She urged UN members to hold Russia to account for its carnage in Ukraine.  ""Russia is accused of the greatest war crimes. Bombing schools, hospitals and homes, targeting families as they try to run to safety,"" she said, adding that the impact from the Kremlin's war will be felt around the world.  — Amanda Macias  Russia's war in Ukraine has gone on for 19 days.  Since Russia's Vladimir Putin invaded his ex-Soviet neighbor last month, the unprovoked carnage has led to the displacement of more than 2.5 million Ukrainians. As desperate Ukrainians flee their homes to neighboring NATO member countries, Russian forces pummel the capital of Kyiv with missiles and artillery.  At least 596 people, including 43 children, have been killed since Russia invaded, the United Nations said.

(For a full version of this story, click here.)  — Adam Jeffery and Amanda Macias  National security adviser Jake Sullivan is slated to meet with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, to discuss the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.  The high-stakes discussion, which will include officials from the National Security Council and State Department, follows warnings from Washington that Beijing should not alleviate the economic pressure mounting on Moscow.  ""The two sides will discuss ongoing efforts to manage the competition between our two countries and discuss the impact of Russia's war against Ukraine on regional and global security,"" the White House said in a statement Sunday announcing the meeting.  The delegations meet amid reports that Moscow asked Beijing for military support in its invasion of Ukraine, something Beijing denied Monday.  — Amanda Macias  Ukraine's state nuclear energy company said Monday in a Telegram post that a line to the Chornobyl nuclear power plant was damaged again by Russian forces occupying the site.  A day prior, Ukraine's atomic energy ministry said power had been restored to Chornobyl after days of repairs to the system.  Chornobyl, the site of a 1986 disaster, was seized by Russian forces on Feb. 24.  — Amanda Macias  ""If there was an escalation [of the war in Ukraine] … we could be heading for World War III, with Russia and China posed against the rest of the world,"" Jochen Wermuth, co-founder of Wermuth Asset Management and former advisor to the Russian Ministry of Finance, told CNBC on Monday.  Reports emerged on Monday that Russia had asked Beijing for military equipment to help with its invasion of Ukraine. Both countries have denied those reports.  — Chloe Taylor  The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has warned that Russia is continuing to spread disinformation about the U.S. Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP).  The U.S. BTRP has partnered with the government of Ukraine since 2005 to reduce the threats posed by pathogens, which are kept in facilities all over the world for public health research purposes.  In the last week, Russia has accused Ukraine of operating chemical and biological weapons laboratories backed by the U.S. — claims dubbed ""outright lies"" by the United States.  Many officials have warned that Russia could be inventing a false narrative to create a pretext for using its own biological or chemical weapons against Ukraine.  — Chloe Taylor and Holly Ellyatt  The Kremlin has denied that it asked China for military equipment to help with its invasion of Ukraine, as reported by western media.  ""Russia has the potential to conduct an operation in Ukraine, has not asked for assistance from other countries,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a regular press briefing on Monday.  ""Moscow did not ask Beijing for help to conduct a special military operation in Ukraine,"" he added, according to an NBC News translation. ""[The reports are] not true that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine.""  Peskov added that the Kremlin would not announce an expected end date for its so-called ""special operation in Ukraine.""  — Chloe Taylor  Kyiv Regional Governor Oleksiy Kuleba said in a televised interview Monday that civilians in frontline towns in the Kyiv region were being successfully evacuated for the fifth consecutive day.  ""The cease-fire in our region is holding,"" he said, but he added that explosions could be heard in the distance from where he was working.  — Chloe Taylor  Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukraine's president and a participant in talks with Russia, has said the discussions are underway — but noted that negotiating with Moscow is ""hard"" due to what he described as its oppressive political regime.    — Chloe Taylor  As of Monday morning, 90 children have been killed in Ukraine as a result of Russia's ""armed aggression,"" Ukraine's general prosecutor's office has said.  More than 100 children have also been injured since the invasion began on Feb. 24, the office said in a statement.  ""Most victims were in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zhytomyr regions,"" the statement said, according to a translation. It noted that two children had died in attacks on civil infrastructure on Sunday.  Bombing and shelling attacks had damaged 379 educational institutions across Ukraine, the general prosecutor's office said.  ""These figures are not final, given the inability to inspect the sites where the Russian armed forces are conducting active hostilities and in the temporarily occupied territories,"" it added.  — Chloe Taylor  China has refuted Western media reports that Russia has asked Beijing to provide it with military equipment to help in its invasion of Ukraine.  Discussing the reports during a regular press briefing Monday, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, accused the U.S. of spreading ""very dangerous"" disinformation on the war in Ukraine.  ""China is hosting a consistent and clear position on the Ukraine issue,"" he said. ""We have always been playing a constructive role in the peace negotiations and what's most important is all sides can maintain restraints, mitigate the situation instead of adding fuel to the fire. We need to advance a diplomatic solution of the situation instead of further escalating the situation.""  China, a close ally of Russia, has not joined the coordinated effort to impose sanctions on Moscow, and has so far refused to call Russia's attack on Ukraine an invasion.  — Chloe Taylor  The fourth round of talks between Ukraine and Russia, scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. Ukraine time (4:30 a.m. ET), will see Ukrainian officials continue to push for an end to hostilities in their country.  Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukraine's president and a participant in the talks, said ahead of the ""hard discussion"" that Ukraine's objectives were to secure a cease-fire, the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and security guarantees.  — Chloe Taylor  Irish Finance Minister and Eurogroup President Pascal Donohoe has told CNBC that the EU must rise to the challenge of imposing sanctions on Russia.  ""We will do so because the costs of not being able to stand by our sanctions, the costs of not increasing our energy independence are far greater both in the medium and long term than any costs that we might confront in the short term,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.  ""So yes, there will be economic impacts as a result of the decisions we are making, but ultimately these impacts are small in the context of the suffering of Ukraine at the moment, and these costs are small in comparison to the costs that the Russian economy is experiencing now as a result of the war that Vladimir Putin is waging.""  — Chloe Taylor  A pregnant woman who was pictured being carried out of a hospital in Mariupol after it was bombed by Russian forces last week has died, the Associated Press reported Monday.  Ukrainian surgeon Timur Marin told AP that the woman was rushed to another hospital after the attack on Wednesday, but doctors were unable to save her or her baby.  The woman was meant to give birth at the hospital in Mariupol.  Ukrainian officials said last week that three people, including a child, had been killed in the bombing of the children's and maternity hospital.  Russian officials denied their forces targeted civilians by bombing the hospital, despite photo evidence showing women being carried from the hospital after the missile strike.  — Chloe Taylor  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba took to Twitter Monday morning with a message ""to those abroad scared of being 'dragged into WWIII.'""  — Chloe Taylor  The U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update on Monday that ""indiscriminate Russian shelling and air attacks are causing widespread destruction.""  British officials noted that the U.N. had already reported 1,663 civilian casualties in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24.  ""As with previous such estimates, the true figures are likely to be significantly higher and will continue to climb as long as Russian operations continue,"" the ministry's update added.  The update also said that more than 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees had been forced to flee their homes as a result of the invasion.  — Chloe Taylor  An attack on an apartment building in Kyiv's Obolon district has killed two people and hospitalized three, Ukraine's State Emergency Services said Monday morning.  The SES said on Telegram that an ""unknown object"" hit the residential building, with two people dying in the resulting fire. The organization added that the search for survivors continues.  — Chloe Taylor  Talks between Ukraine and Russia will resume on Monday morning, according to Ukrainian lawmaker David Arakhamia.  ""Negotiations with Russia will take place this morning via video link,"" he said in a statement posted to Telegram by Interior Ministry Advisor Anton Geraschenko.  The talks are due to begin at 10:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET).  Last week, talks between Russia and Ukraine's foreign ministers failed to make progress on establishing a cease-fire agreement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at the time.  — Chloe Taylor  You can read Sunday's live coverage here:   Ukraine claims it downed Russian aircraft; UN says at least 596 civilians have died in Ukraine  Ukraine's Air Force Command claims it downed eight Russian military aircraft on Sunday, including four fixed-wing aircraft.  The command said on Facebook that it used anti-aircraft missiles to take down four planes, three helicopters and an unmanned aerial vehicle during an attack by Russian forces in the Kyiv region.  CNBC was unable to independently verify Ukraine's claim, which it made late Sunday. NBC News reported that air raid sirens sounded over Kyiv on Sunday morning.  Separately on Sunday, Russian missiles pounded a Ukraine military base near Lviv, only 20 miles (33 km) from the border with NATO nation Poland.  Ukraine officials said 35 people were killed and 135 injured in the Lviv attack.  Russian aircraft are flying 200 sorties a day, but mostly firing missiles from within Russian airspace rather than risking flights over Ukraine, according to a Friday report from military and security news site Defense One.— Ted Kemp "
Could Russia use chemical weapons in Ukraine?,2022-03-14 12:12:29+00:00,"There are increasing concerns that Russia could be prepared to use chemical weapons to attack Ukraine, with Western officials and strategists warning the threat posed by Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin in this regard is credible and serious.  In the last week, Russia itself has accused Ukraine of operating chemical and biological weapons laboratories backed by the U.S. The claims were roundly rebuffed by Ukrainian and Western officials, with the U.S. describing them as ""outright lies."" But they have caused alarm nonetheless, with many officials seeing them as Russia inventing and building a false narrative and pretext for using its own chemical weapons against Ukraine, a prospect described as ""horrific"" by the U.S.  ""Russia has a track record of accusing the West of the very crimes that Russia itself is perpetrating. These tactics are an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attacks on Ukraine,"" State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement last week.  ""The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine ... It is Russia that has active chemical and biological weapons programs and is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention,"" he added.  President Joe Biden warned Friday that there would be a ""severe price"" to pay if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday that such a move would be a war crime.  ""Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies,"" Stoltenberg told the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.  CNBC has contacted Russia's foreign ministry for a response to the U.S. and NATO's comments.  While the West has been united in its condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the U.K. describing Putin's regime as ""barbaric,"" just how far the U.S. and its NATO allies are willing to go to support Ukraine, and stop Russia, is a moot point. NATO has repeatedly ruled out any kind of military support, such as a no-fly zone pleaded for by Ukraine, that could lead it into a direct confrontation with nuclear power Russia.  But Poland's President Andrzej Duda said in an interview Sunday that the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by Russia could change the West's calculus over the conflict.  ""Of course, everybody hopes that he would not dare do that but ... if he uses any weapons of mass destruction then this will be a game changer in the whole thing,"" he told the BBC's Sophie Raworth Sunday, adding that NATO would have to ""think seriously what to do because then it starts to be dangerous not only for Europe … but the whole world.""  With his almost internationally condemned invasion of Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, Putin is seen as an increasingly unpredictable leader. With Russia facing far more resistance than it expected to face in Ukraine, and appearing to prepare to attack the capital Kyiv, there are fears that Putin could resort to using unconventional — and outlawed — weapons.  Duda said that Putin had already lost the war politically, and was losing it militarily, and that made the Russian leader dangerous: ""If you're asking me whether Putin can use chemical weapons, I think Putin can use anything right now, especially when he's in this difficult situation,"" he told the BBC.  While fears are heightened that Russia could resort to using chemical weapons in Ukraine, it's important to remember that there is nothing to suggest their use is imminent.  On Friday, Reuters published a briefing by unnamed Western officials who noted that Russia might use chemical weapons in Ukraine in a ""false flag"" attack to provide a retrospective justification for its invasion, but there is nothing to suggest a broader use of such weapons in the war.  In the Reuters report, the officials said that ""clearly, whilst the Russians are highly likely to have a chemical weapons capability, there is nothing to suggest that they intend to use [them] at this point in a major escalation of the current conflict.""  Nonetheless, Russia has been accused of using chemical weapons before, both on individuals seen as outspoken critics of Putin, and on a wider level was allegedly complicit in their use in the Syrian civil war.  A chemical weapon is defined by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons as a chemical used to cause intentional death or harm through its toxic properties.  The OPCW's mission is to implement the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention, an arms control treaty signed by 193 countries (including Russia) in 1997 which prohibits the production and use of chemical weapons. It also saw signatories commit to destroying chemical weapons production facilities and stockpiles of such weapons.  Putin said in late 2017 that Russia had completed the destruction of its last chemical weapons (and he chided the U.S. for not yet doing so) but the poisoning of former Russian spy (and double agent) Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the U.K. in 2018 with a Novichok nerve agent (developed by the Soviet Union) and the poisoning of Putin critic and opposition politician Alexei Navalny in 2020 have suggested Russia has maintained an illicit chemical weapons program.  Russia denied involvement in both incidents despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  There have been other cases of chemical weapons attacks in which Russia has been heavily suspected of involvement or at the very least, complicity in their use.  Incidents have included the poisoning in 2004 of Ukraine's then pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko with dioxin, and the fatal poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB officer and critic of Putin who died in London after drinking green tea laced with polonium-210, a rare and potent radioactive isotope. A 2016 inquiry found Putin probably approved the killing. The Kremlin denied any involvement in either incident.  Then, when Russian troops fought alongside Bashar Assad's government forces in Syria's civil war in which the nerve agent sarin was used against civilians, killing over 1,400 people, Russia was accused of helping Syria to cover up the crime. Russia and Syria denied any use of chemical weapons but the OPCW's inspectors found undeclared toxins and munitions during site visits and in 2020, the chemical weapons watchdog condemned Syria's use of banned sarin and chlorine bombs.  When it comes to Ukraine now, we cannot say for sure whether Putin could or will use any kind of chemical weapons. But with Russia's reputation preceding it, close observers of Putin's regime suspect that he could have few qualms to deploy the same tactics again, and say the threat is a credible one.  ""Are they capable of using low-grade chemical weapons in some form in Ukraine? They are, they did it in Syria. Yes, in a sense, it was through the regime, but I think they could [do it again],"" Ian Lesser, vice president of think tank the German Marshall Fund of the United States, told CNBC.  Meanwhile, Wojciech Lorenz, a senior analyst at the International Security Programme at The Polish Institute of International Affairs, told CNBC that ""you can never know"" what Russia will do, but when it comes to the threat of chemical weapons use, ""you have to treat it seriously.""  ""Russia has already used chemical weapons on the territory of NATO. They used chemical weapons in Britain, they used chemical weapons to poison and in their attempts to kill Navalny ... and it clearly indicates that they have chemical weapons that they should not have because they signed the chemical weapons treaty,"" he said.  Andrew Weber, former assistant secretary of defense for the Obama administration, and who now sits on the nonprofit Council on Strategic Risks, said this weekend that aside from the chemical weapons that have been associated with Russia in past incidents, some kind of biological weapon could be used instead.  ""I think we need to take it very seriously, especially given the escalation of the disinformation campaign by Russia,"" he told New Zealand Radio's Morning Report on Saturday. As well as the possible use of chemical weapons, he said Russia could deploy biological weapons in Ukraine which the U.N. defines as disease-causing organisms or toxins disseminated with the intention to harm or kill humans, animals or plants.   ""Biological weapons would be different. They might use something like anthrax, for example, which is not contagious and wouldn't spread back to Russia. But the Russian illegal biological weapons program includes things like plague, tularemia [a rare infectious disease] and even smallpox,"" he said.  Both chemical and biological weapons are used to terrorize the opponent, and to cause mass casualties, he said. But he expected a massive response from the West should Russia resort to using them, saying ""all bets would be off, there would definitely be a very very strong, united international response to any use of chemical or biological weapons.""  The danger in the Ukraine conflict, analysts point out, is that Putin might resort to ordering the use of chemical weapons if he feels that the armed forces are not making progress in seizing and occupying Ukraine, particularly as Ukraine's forces and volunteer fighters mount a staunch resistance and vow to fight to the death.  ""I believe strongly that if the Russian forces get bogged down, and they will from time to time, that Putin will authorize the use of chemical weapons. He's done it before and he's likely to do it again since he is focused single-mindedly on taking over all of Ukraine and anything that deters or detracts from his ability to do that then he's going to react accordingly,"" retired U.S. Army Colonel Jack Jacobs told CNBC's Shepard Smith late Friday.  He noted that Russia's indiscriminate bombing of hospitals and other civilian targets has shown its increasingly uninhibited approach to the war in Ukraine as it seeks to make strides into Ukraine's territory.  ""He's capable of doing anything as he is single-mindedly focused on one thing and that is taking over Ukraine,"" Jacobs said. "
Deripaska: Squatters occupy London mansion thought to belong to Russia oligarch,2022-03-14 22:49:05+00:00,"LONDON — Squatters have occupied a London mansion thought to belong to one of the Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the British government.  The property in Belgrave Square — one of London's most exclusive neighborhoods, located just moments from Buckingham Palace — is said to be owned by billionaire energy mogul Oleg Deripaska, who was sanctioned by authorities last week over his ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Protesters took occupation of the luxury property early Monday, draping it with Ukrainian flags and a sign saying ""this property has been liberated.""  According to the BBC, the group claimed to ""do the job"" of authorities, who have come under criticism for their apparent delay in clamping down on members of Putin's inner circle.  Police in riot gear reportedly entered the property midday Monday after reports that the squatters were on the property. It is not clear how the protesters gained access to the building.  In a statement seen by Sky News, the Metropolitan police said they had completed a search of the property and were ""satisfied"" no protestors were inside. They added that they ""continue to engage"" with those on the balcony.  Ownership details of the multimillion-pound, historic property at Five Belgrave Square are murky. However, High Court documents named Deripaska as the beneficial owner over a decade ago, according to Sky.  Public records show the mansion was originally purchased and is currently held by Ravellot Limited, an offshore company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, the BBC has reported.  At the request of the National Crime Agency, five bank accounts belonging to Graham Bonham-Carter, the named contact for Ravellot Limited, are now subject to asset freezing orders over his alleged links to Deripaska.  ""We can confirm that the NCA has secured two Account Freezing Orders in respect of five bank accounts held by Mr Graham Bonham-Carter,"" the NCA said in a statement shared with CNBC.  ""The orders were obtained on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the money in the accounts was derived from the laundering of funds of an individual subject to sanctions in the United States, namely Oleg Deripaska.""  The British government on Thursday put Deripaska, founder of metals and hydropower company EN+ and six other businesses, on a growing list of Putin allies sanctioned by authorities. The sanctions state that his assets will be seized and travel restricted.  The tycoon, whose wealth derives from the privatization of Russian state assets, has been under U.S. sanctions since 2018.  The protesters reportedly called for the seven-bedroom mansion, which houses a Turkish bath and home cinema, to be made available to Ukrainian refugees.  It comes after U.K. Housing Minister Michael Gove on Sunday touted a similar idea, telling the BBC that he was exploring the possibility of housing migrants in properties seized by the government.  ""I want to explore an option which would allow us to use the homes and properties of sanctioned individuals for as long as they are sanctioned for humanitarian and other purposes,"" he told the BBC.

China's Silicon Valley Shenzhen orders production halts control Covid,2022-03-14 18:16:08+00:00,"BEIJING — Mainland China is facing its worst Covid-19 outbreak since the country clamped down on the pandemic in 2020, with major cities rushing to limit business activity.  Shenzhen, the biggest city in the manufacturing hub of Guangdong province, told all businesses not involved with essential public services to suspend production or have employees work from home for a week starting Monday.  The production halts include Apple supplier Foxconn, which said in a statement to CNBC its factories in the city would remain closed until notified by the government.  The city, sometimes called China's ""Silicon Valley,"" has shut public transportation and begun a third city-wide round of testing. Shenzhen has reported more than 400 confirmed cases since late February.  Those numbers and case counts across China pale in comparison with other countries. But the rapid increase in cases in the last few days has local authorities rushing to control the outbreak as China seeks to maintain its zero-Covid strategy.  Shanghai, the coastal metropolis home to many foreign businesses and financial firms in China, has reverted schools to online classes. Some neighborhoods have entered lockdown and conducted mass testing, and residents typically cannot leave until results come back negative.  The city on Saturday told residents not to leave Shanghai unless absolutely necessary. More than 600 confirmed cases have been found since late February.  Jilin province in northern China reported an overnight surge this past weekend of over 1,000 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases, for a total of more than 2,900 cases this month as of Sunday.  In all, mainland China reported 1,437 new confirmed cases as of Sunday — with only 100 attributed to travelers from overseas — for a total of 8,531 domestically transmitted active cases. That's the most since March 2020. No new deaths have been reported.  Hong Kong, a special administrative region just across the border from Shenzhen, has fought a resurgence of Covid cases in the last few weeks. The region has the highest number globally of new Covid-related deaths per million people, according to Our World in Data.  Hong Kong's outbreak stems from the highly transmissible omicron variant, which has since spread to the mainland.  The capital city of Beijing said Sunday it identified six sources of transmission for the latest handful of municipal cases, mostly reported around the downtown and eastern parts of the city. Local authorities said anyone returning to Beijing must not attend gatherings for seven days following arrival.  For months the capital has had one of the strictest Covid control policies in the country. Travelers must show a negative Covid test taken 48 hours before entering Beijing, and take another test within 72 hours of arrival. If their 14-day travel history shows they visited a locale with a confirmed case, they are not allowed into the city.  Read CNBC's latest global coverage of the Covid pandemic:  After the emergence of Covid-19 in Wuhan in late 2019, mainland China shut down more than half the country in February 2020 to control the outbreak. Domestically, the virus came under control within weeks, but Covid had spread overseas in a global pandemic.  As of Monday, South Korea followed by Germany have the highest 28-day new case counts at 5.2 million and 4.8 million, respectively, according to Johns Hopkins data. The U.S. has recorded the most deaths, at more than 967,000 as of Monday morning Beijing time.  Mainland China has maintained a strict ""zero-Covid"" policy for the last two years. The travel restrictions and potential for swift lockdowns have weighed on domestic tourism and services businesses, dragging down consumer spending.  An annual parliamentary meeting that wrapped up Friday gave no signs that the central government plans to loosen its Covid control policy, although official statements in recent months have added terms such as ""dynamic.""  Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said at a government meeting for epidemic control Saturday that the country should keep following the ""dynamic"" zero-Covid policy and that all measures should be taken to prevent a large-scale virus resurgence.  Her remarks, as published by state media, ended with a call to prepare the way for a top meeting of the ruling Chinese Communist Party later this year. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to receive an unprecedented third term at the meeting.  Morgan Stanley says these Chinese stocks could rebound — Alibaba, Tencent aren't on the list  Wall Street banks name their favorite Asia stocks — and Citi says one could have upside of 167%  Xpeng and more: Morgan Stanley says these stocks will benefit from rising oil prices  Abandoning zero-Covid ""now could be perceived as conceding that the strategy did not work in the first place,"" Nomura's chief China economist Ting Lu said in a note Friday.  ""The next 12 months are a crucial time for the one-in-a-decade leadership change, which is pushing top leaders to stick to the status quo in order to avoid making policy mistakes,"" he said. ""Pictures of many Hong Kong Covid patients treated outside overwhelmed hospitals have further convinced Chinese officials and the masses that ZCS is China's only viable solution to the coronavirus.""  China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a study in November that said shifting to the coexistence strategy of other countries would likely result in hundreds of thousands of new daily cases and devastate the national medical system.  But, Lu said, the economic costs of the zero-Covid strategy are rising, while the benefits are diminishing.  ""Amid rounds of lockdowns and travel bans across China,"" he said, ""more individuals are feeling the pinch, becoming worn out, unemployed or underemployed, and have drained their savings to a level at which they have to reduce spending.""

Russia-Ukraine: Legacy of Germany's Angela Merkel is seen differently,2022-03-14 14:26:16+00:00,"With Vladimir Putin's unprovoked attack against Ukraine, political analysts are now reassessing the long and deeply complicated relationship the Russian leader had with ex-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and how Moscow came to hold so much sway over the rest of Europe.  The former German leader was known for speaking Russian and keeping diplomatic ties with Putin. It was also during her term that Germany stepped up its energy links to Moscow and kept its national defense spending to a minimum.  But, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has now led to a dramatic shift in German politics.  New Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ""forceful policy shifts is a firm repudiation of the core of Merkel's foreign economic policy,"" Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank, told CNBC via email.  ""Germany's foreign economic policy is no longer predicated on 'Russia being a stability oriented actor,' but instead an aggressive imperialist power,"" Kirkegaard added.  Scholz announced a halt on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline after Russia's first military moves into two breakaway regions of Ukraine in late February. Nord Stream 2, which started being built in 2018 during Merkel's chancellorship, is seen as a controversial project which was meant to bring additional gas from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, circumnavigating counties like Ukraine and Poland.  Merkel's ""big failure"" was not reversing those economic links and energy projects in the wake of Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, said Daniela Schwarzer, executive director for Europe and Eurasia at the Open Society Foundations think tank.  In fact, Merkel kept her backing for the gas pipeline in place, despite concerns from Ukraine and other countries, notably the U.S. The German chancellery was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC Monday.  Germany's gas imports from Russia amounted to around 36% of its total in 2010, which rose to a roughly 65% share by 2020, according to figures from Eurostat.  Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at H.E.C. Paris Business School, said: ""No other country has downplayed Russia's rebellious stance towards the world order as Merkel's Germany.""  ""It is Nord Stream 2 which epitomizes Merkel's appeasement approach towards Russia, to the point of embodying today all what was wrong with Germany's stance towards Russia. By establishing an unnecessary relationship of interdependence with Vladimir Putin, Merkel's Germany made him stronger while weakening the whole of Europe and NATO,"" Alemanno added.  Scholz initially appeared careful with his stance toward Nord Stream 2 since he took power in December. However, as tensions with Russia worsened, he announced a halt on the certification of the pipeline as many political analysts had been expecting.  More recently, as Russia advanced its invasion of Ukraine, Scholz said Berlin would be sending weapons to Ukraine and would be stepping up government investments on defense. The move signaled a major shift in a German defense policy that's been in place since the end of World War II that prevented the exporting of locally made weapons to conflict zones.  ""Merkel underspent,"" Schwarzer said, both toward NATO and the EU. ""Part of the [new] money is not a new strategy, but the recognition that we need to do more,"" she said, noting that the German army is ""in a bad shape.""  But there is one area where Merkel's legacy is still intact: welcoming refugees. Merkel will always be reminded for her stance back in 2015 at the height of a massive influx of refugees into Europe, when she implemented an open-door policy to those fleeing war from countries like Syria.  ""Merkel's very clear and open position on Syrian refugees led to a strong societal engagement in Germany,"" Schwarzer from Open Society Foundations said, adding that this policy was now supporting the reception of Ukrainian refugees too.  According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, more than 2 million people have now fled Ukraine. Although they are arriving primarily to the countries closest to Ukraine, some have also moved on to Germany, where locals have been offering shelter and support.  More broadly, Schwarzer also said there was another part of Merkel's legacy still very much intact. Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany, was seen as the de-facto leader of the West during Donald Trump's tenure at the White House, with critics highlighting that America's position on the global stage diminished somewhat with Trump as president.  Schwarzer said that Scholz has built on this idea, saying he ""says the same things but in a more concrete way."" ""This sense of responsibility is a continuity,"" she added. "
Tencent shares plunge after report of record fine for money laundering,2022-03-14 13:10:50+00:00,"Tencent shares dived in Hong Kong on Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported the Chinese tech giant could face a record fine for violating anti-money laundering rules.  The WSJ, citing people familiar with the matter, said that WeChat Pay, the mobile payments service run by Tencent, allowed the transfer of funds for illicit purposes like gambling. Tencent also failed to fully comply with rules around checking the identity of merchants and individuals as well as the source of their funds, the newspaper said.  Tencent was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC Monday.  Shares in the tech firm fell nearly 10% to close at 331.80 Hong Kong dollars ($42.38), their lowest closing level since Dec. 5, 2019.  Since a record high close of 766.50 Hong Kong dollars in January 2021, Tencent shares have shed around 56%, wiping off more than $500 billion of value off the company.  The WSJ report comes after more than a year of intense regulatory tightening by Beijing on the country's technology sector that has sought to rein in the power and stamp out some of the alleged bad behaviors of the biggest technology companies. China has sought to introduce regulation in areas ranging from anti-trust to data protection.  A particular focus of regulators has been non-bank financial players such as Tencent and Alibaba-affiliate Ant Group. These companies offer financial services but traditionally without the strict regulation that banks face. China is looking to change that.  Tencent has, so far, managed to escape a major regulatory blow, unlike Alibaba and Meituan which have both been hit with anti-trust fines.  The Wall Street Journal said that Tencent's potential fine could be at least hundreds of millions of yuan, but it is still under deliberation.  The Hong Kong-listed shares of other Chinese tech names also took a battering on Monday as already-fragile sentiment towards the country's internet sector continues to get tested.  China is facing a new wave of Covid infections across the country leading to lockdowns in cities and factories closing. Meanwhile, investors are still on edge about whether U.S.-listed Chinese companies could face delistings and if Beijing's regulatory onslaught will continue. "

Deutsche Bank to wind down Russia operations in major U-turn,2022-03-14 16:52:36+00:00,"Deutsche Bank has said it will wind down its Russia operations — a major U-turn that sent shares higher Monday.  In an announcement released late Friday, the German bank said it was joining a host of international peers in exiting the country in response to its invasion of Ukraine and resultant operational restrictions.  The move came a day after chief financial officer James von Moltke told CNBC Thursday that it was ""not practical"" to close its Russia business.  Deutsche Bank shares jumped higher as investors acknowledged the turnaround, rising more than 8% in early Monday trade before closing the day up over 7%.  ""Like some international peers and in line with our legal and regulatory obligations, we are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" the bank said in a statement announcing the departure.  ""There won't be any new business in Russia,"" it added.  The decision follows similar moves by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, which all announced last week that they would wind down their operations in Russia, joining a host of major corporations that have distanced themselves from the pariah state.  CFO von Moltke had previously defended the bank's decision to remain operational in Russia, owing to its responsibility to its clients there.  ""We're there to support our clients. And so, for practical purposes, that isn't an option that's available to us. Nor would it be the right thing to do in terms of managing those client relationships and helping them to manage their situation,"" he said at the time.  The comments drew ire as pressure mounts on companies to support Western allies in boycotting President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine. "
The rise (and fall?) of the Covid-19 testing industry,2022-03-14 09:04:46+00:00,"The Covid-19 testing industry sprung up almost overnight.   There was an overwhelming demand for tests around the world, and entrepreneurs reacted quickly – pouring money into hiring staff, securing supplies and building laboratories. Together with more established players, testing capacity ballooned and a brand-new industry was born.   Qured is one of those newcomers. It was launched in 2017 as a doctor-on-demand service, but in 2020, the company spotted an opportunity it couldn't ignore.   ""It was really demand from our patients, which drove our pivot towards Covid testing,"" said Alex Templeton, CEO and co-founder of Qured.   Initially, Qured focused on helping businesses bring their staff back to work safely, but it was an innovation in rapid self-testing for travel that put Qured on the map.   ""We just started thinking about how to validate that it's you who's done it, that you've swabbed correctly. We figured out that a video call was the way to really solve this,"" Templeton said.   This innovation resonated with British Airways, and in February 2021 the carrier launched a partnership with Qured. From there, growth exploded, with the company striking deals with American Airlines and Heathrow Airport, as well.   Watch the video above to learn more about the rise of Covid testing companies, as well as what's next as the demand for these tests diminish.  "
A Harvard nutritionist shares the 6 best brain foods you 'aren't eating enough of',2022-03-13 13:03:14+00:00,"Much like the intricate relationship between the gut and brain, diet and mental health are inextricably linked — and the connection between them goes both ways: a lack of good dietary choices leads to an increase in mental health issues, and mental health issues in turn lead to poor eating habits.  When people learn that I am a psychiatrist, a brain health researcher, and a nutritionist, they often ask me how they should eat to maximize the awesome power of the brain.  Based on my work with hundreds of patients, below are the best brain-boosting foods that people aren't eating enough of. Incorporating them into your diet can improve your mood, sharpen memory, and help your brain work at peak efficiency:  In addition to adding flavor, spices are known their antioxidant properties. In other words, they help the brain fight off harmful free radicals and therefore prevent oxidative stress, which can damage tissues.  One of my favorite spices is turmeric — a standout when it comes to reducing anxiety. Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, can decrease anxiety and change the corresponding brain chemistry, protecting the hippocampus.  I also love saffron. In 2013, a meta-analysis of five previously published, randomized and controlled trials looked at the effects of saffron supplementation on symptoms of depression among participants with major depressive disorder.  In all these trials, researchers found that consuming saffron significantly reduced depression symptoms compared to the placebo controls.  Fermented foods are made by combining milk, vegetables or other raw ingredients with microorganisms like yeast and bacteria.  Some examples include plain yogurt with active cultures, sauerkraut, kimchi and kombucha. These are all sources of live bacteria that can enhance healthy gut function and decrease anxiety.  In the brain, fermented foods may provide several advantages. A 2016 review of 45 studies indicated that fermented foods might protect the brain in animals, improving memory and slowing cognitive decline.  Probiotic-rich yogurt can be a powerful part of your diet, but keep in mind that yogurt that undergoes heat treatment does not have the same benefits. One such example is yogurt-covered raisins — these aren't going to help your anxiety, as the heat-treated yogurt has no beneficial bacteria left.  Dark chocolate is an excellent source of iron, which helps make up the covering that protects neurons and helps control the synthesis of the chemicals and chemical pathways involved in mood.  In 2019, a cross-sectional survey of more than 13,000 adults found that people who regularly eat dark chocolate had a 70% reduced risk of depression symptoms.  Dark chocolate also has plenty of antioxidants, as long as you stick to the dark stuff and make sure that it doesn't have too much sugar.  Avocados have relatively high amounts of magnesium, which is important for proper brain function.   The first report of magnesium treatment for agitated depression was published in 1921, and it showed success in a whopping 220 out of 250 cases.  Since then, countless studies have suggested that depression is related to magnesium deficiency. Several case studies, in which patients were treated with 125 to 300 milligrams of magnesium, have demonstrated rapid recovery from major depression, often in less than a week.  I love blending avocados, chickpeas and olive oil as a tasty spread on a low-GI toast like pumpernickel, or as a dip for fresh-cut vegetables.  Nuts have healthy fats and oils that our brains need to function well, along with essential vitamins and minerals — for example, selenium in Brazil nuts.  The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of omega-3 fatty acids in walnuts show great promise in improving thinking and memory.  I recommend eating 1/4 cup a day (not more — it's easy to overdo it with nuts!) as a snack or added to your salad or vegetable side dish. Nuts can even be combined into a homemade granola or trail mix that contains much less sugar and salt than store-bought versions.  When I say that leafy greens like kale make a difference in health, my patients turn up their noses at the idea. But leafy greens contain vitamin E, carotenoids and flavonoids, which are nutrients that protect against dementia and cognitive decline.  Another benefit is that they're an incredible source of folate, a natural form of vitamin B9 that is important in red blood cell formation. Where folate deficiency may underlie some neurological conditions, improving folate status has beneficial effects on our cognitive status, and is a necessary cofactor in neurotransmitter production.  Greens such as spinach, Swiss chard, and dandelion greens are also an excellent source of folate!

Ford says it will ramp up EV offering in Europe,2022-03-15 07:11:19+00:00,"Ford has laid out plans to roll out three new passenger electric vehicles and four new commercial EVs in Europe by 2024, with the company saying it expected to sell over 600,000 EVs per year in the region by 2026.  The automotive giant also wants all vehicle sales in Europe to be zero-emission by 2035.  In a statement Monday, Ford said the ramp up would commence with the production of a medium-sized electric crossover in Cologne, Germany, in 2023.  Then the manufacture of another electric vehicle in Cologne will start in 2024, while an electric version of the Ford Puma, produced in Romania, will be available the same year.Ford said the EV production planned for Cologne was now slated to hit 1.2 million vehicles across a period of six years. Investment in the EVs planned for Cologne will amount to $2 billion.  On the commercial vehicle front, four new electric versions in Ford's Transit range will also be produced, starting in 2023.  In comments made Monday, Ford of Europe's chair, Stuart Rowley, said electrification represented ""the most transformative change in our industry in over 100 years.""  Wall Street banks pick their top semiconductor stocks as electric vehicle production soars  Forget Tesla — this auto stock is the one to buy right now, analyst says  Europe's moving away from Russian energy — and that could boost EV charging stocks  Ford also said it had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with South Korea's SK On Co. and Turkey's Koç Holding. The MOU relates to the establishment of a joint venture centered around the development of a commercial EV battery facility near the Turkish capital of Ankara.  If all goes to plan, it's hoped production at the plant could begin by the middle of this decade. Ford said the JV had support from the Turkish government and would have a capacity ranging between 30 to 45 gigawatt hours per year.  All the above comes at a time when the European Union is looking to reduce the environmental footprint of transportation.  The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is targeting a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions from cars and vans by 2035. Turkey, where the battery facility would be located, is not part of the EU.  The U.K., which left the EU at the end of January 2020, wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions.  Monday's announcement follows on from Ford saying on Mar. 2 it would separate its electric and internal combustion engine businesses into different units.  Ford is one of several major automotive companies attempting to expand its electrical vehicle offering and challenge Elon Musk's Tesla.  In March 2021, Volvo Cars said it planned to become a ""fully electric car company"" by the year 2030. Elsewhere, BMW Group has said it wants fully electric vehicles to represent at least 50% of its deliveries by 2030.  In Feb. 2022, the Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta of Nissan explained his company had decided to move away from the development of new internal combustion engines in Europe once a tougher set of emissions standards, known as Euro 7, come into force.  Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Ford made an announcement about separating its electric and internal combustion engine businesses on Mar. 2. "
"Egg freezing, IVF, surrogacy: Fertility benefits are the new work perk",2022-03-21 10:56:14+00:00,"When Priya and her husband discovered they were infertile, it cost them $20,000 and years of intrusive treatment to conceive their daughter.  A couple of years later when they had their son, it was a fraction of the cost and relatively painless — thanks in large part to her employer who helped foot the bill and arrange the procedure.  ""The entire experience, between what we went through before ... and after, was night and day,"" said Priya, a Seattle-based senior program manager whose company introduced a more comprehensive fertility benefit program after the birth of her first child.  ""Being infertile is something you can never plan for,"" she continued. ""Having power over your own decision, when most of being infertile means you don't have any, is a game-changer.""  It may sound beyond the realms of employer responsibility, but Priya's experience is not unique. She is one of a growing number of employees benefiting from the latest category of workplace perk: fertility benefits.  From egg freezing to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and surrogacy, employees are increasingly enjoying a full suite of fertility benefits as companies look for new ways to attract top talent and boost their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) credentials in an increasingly competitive jobs landscape.  As of 2020, more than two-fifths (42%) of large U.S. employers — those with over 20,000 staff — offered coverage for IVF treatment, while almost one-fifth (19%) offered egg freezing. For smaller companies with over 500 employees, those figures were 27% and 11%, respectively.  It marks a rapid uptick from the mid-2010s when such novel perks were almost exclusively limited to Silicon Valley trailblazers like Facebook and Apple. In 2015, just over one-third (36%) of large companies offered IVF and only 6% covered egg freezing.  And with the coronavirus pandemic having shifted individual priorities and boosted employee leverage, more companies are introducing the benefit to remain competitive. Today, employers from JPMorgan and Microsoft to Unilever and Boston Consulting Group offer variations of the benefit.  ""When organizations first started funding egg freezing, it was quite radical and extraordinary, and it's becoming much more mainstream now,"" said Beth Hale, a partner at employment law specialists CM Murray.  Within the past year, Progyny and WINFertility — two leading providers of fertility benefit services — have each doubled their client bases, now providing packages for large and small employers across a range of industries including finance, pharmaceuticals and fast-moving consumer goods.  ""The Great Resignation and resulting historically tight labor market have simply accelerated prevailing trends and pushed employers to more quickly implement family building programs to attract and retain talent,"" said WINFertility CEO Roger Shedlin.  The trend comes at a time when more people are seeking fertility treatments, both for medical and non-medical reasons.  One in eight U.S. couples has trouble conceiving. For U.K. couples, that figure is closer to one in seven.  Meantime, the number of women choosing to freeze their eggs is rising — up 1,000% in the U.S. between 2009 and 2016, according to some estimates — and the number of individuals, heterosexual and same-sex couples seeking non-traditional routes to parenthood is growing further still.  The cost of such treatments remains unfeasibly high for many, however. The typical price for one egg freezing cycle in the U.S. is $11,000, with additional charges including hormone medication ($5,000) and storage ($2,000). IVF treatment can cost closer to $24,000.  For 34-year-old Aja Harbert, a single, California-based HR director, the price of such procedures made freezing her eggs ""financially unobtainable.""  That was until 2020, when her employer introduced a $25,000-lifetime benefit for gestation and surrogacy services, which she said gave her the freedom to pursue her career without sacrificing her parenting prospects.  ""I could sense the looming crossroad that many professional women face — the pressurized decision of wanting to advance in their career while starting a family,"" said Harbert of investment firm B Capital.  ""The concept of being able to delay that decision by freezing my eggs was something that suited my personal plan well,"" she added.  Financial costs aside, often grueling treatment processes can take their toll professionally — as well as emotionally and physically — requiring additional support from employers.  For Harbert, her experience was ""a three-month journey of dozens of doctor's appointments, daily self-injected hormones, and restricted diets, all while working full-time.""  Dervilla Lannon, a 40-year-old vice-president of people at Silicon Valley-based security start-up Verkada, said she's apprehensive about starting her first egg freezing cycle this month, having seen her friend undergo the same process. However, having a supportive boss was made the decision much easier, she said.  ""It is hugely encouraging for a start-up of less than six years to offer this benefit,"" said Lannon, who advocated for a one-time $10,000 fertility treatment allowance for all staff.  Studies suggest the pay-off of such benefits is there for employers, too, with staff who take advantage of them more likely to return to work after parental leave and remain in the job long term.  According to the FertilityIQ's 2019-2020 Family-Building Workplace Index, almost two-thirds (61%) of employees who received fertility coverage from an employer said they felt more loyal and committed to the company.  The same study found that 88% of women who had IVF treatment fully paid for by their employer chose to return to that employer after maternity leave, compared to around 50% of the regular population without fertility benefits.  That could be a win for employers as they seek to improve their female and LGBTQ+ representation, particularly within their more senior ranks.  ""These benefits are increasingly seen as central to DEI objectives,"" said Progyny's CEO Pete Anevski. ""Fertility benefits can help companies improve gender diversity while also showing they value their female workforce.""  The rise of fertility benefits is not without controversy, however.  Critics argue that schemes such as IVF and surrogacy can blur employer-employee boundaries, leaving recipients feeling indebted as their companies take greater physical and financial stakes in their personal lives.  Meanwhile, pregnancy deferral treatments like egg freezing arguably perpetuate the so-called hustle culture of certain fast-paced industries, encouraging would-be parents to postpone their child-rearing dreams in the name of career success — with no guarantees of either.  ""The issue is if you're encouraging people in one direction or another,"" said CM Murray's Hale, noting that much of the criticism historically has been around perception. Workplace benefits after all should be enabling, allowing better work-life balance, rather than enclosing, encouraging more work.  With the majority of benefits targeted toward would-be parents — and women in particular — some also argue that current schemes could pose a new form of discrimination, making little allowance for those who choose to remain childless or find their caregiving responsibilities directed elsewhere, such as toward elderly care.  In that regard, Hale said employers should take care to ensure their benefits are not gender-specific and instead facilitate all people managing their family and ""how and if they choose to have one.""  Still, beneficiaries and advocacy groups say fertility treatments are just one facet in the full suite of health and wellbeing benefits now being offered by modern employers, and should be considered as such.  ""These benefits are no longer a 'nice to have' perk, but an essential part of an employer's benefits package,"" said Progyny's Anevski.  Meanwhile for Priya, reflecting on her two pregnancies, she said having an employer that offers fertility support was — and continues to be — a deciding factor in her career moves. And as employees enjoy greater leverage in a tight jobs market, that may be the true test of such schemes' success.  ""The world is a very different place from where it was five years ago,"" said Priya. ""We live in a world where family comes in all shapes and forms. Some can't have children biologically, but it doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to have a family of their own."" "
Benedict Cumberbatch plans to take in Ukrainian refugees,2022-03-14 14:10:06+00:00,"Brits will be given £350 ($457) a month to house Ukrainians fleeing the war, according to a new government project being launched this week, with actor Benedict Cumberbatch also planning to play his part.  ""Doctor Strange"" star Cumberbatch told Sky News in a red carpet interview at the British Academy Film Awards on Sunday that ""everyone needs to do as much as they can"" to support Ukrainians, as Russia continues its unprovoked attack on the country.  ""I think already today the news has broke that there's been a record number of people volunteering to take people into their homes, I hope to be part of that myself and also donating to charities who can help people in a very real way on the ground either in Poland or just over the border, if it's safe to do so,"" Cumberbatch said.  The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, said Friday that it estimated more than 2.5 million refugees had fled Ukraine for neighboring countries.  Britain's housing minister Michael Gove shared details of the U.K. government's ""Homes for Ukraine"" project in a BBC interview on Sunday. It will give Britons £350 a month to house Ukrainian refugees for a minimum of six months.  Gove said that the U.K. government would be launching an online portal on Monday for Britons to register their interest in the plan, with the process of matching refugees to U.K. homes starting on Friday. He said that polls had indicated that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Brits would potentially be willing to take in Ukrainian refugees.  Gove said he himself was exploring the possibility of taking in refugees.  As of Sunday afternoon, 4,000 people had been granted U.K. visas under the government's Ukraine Family Scheme, according to the Home Office. Gove expected that the U.K. could receive ""tens of thousands"" of Ukrainian refugees.  He added that he wanted to explore the option of using the properties of sanctioned Russian oligarchs for ""humanitarian and other purposes.""  Last week, the U.K. government added another seven Russian oligarchs onto its sanctions list, freezing their assets and imposing a travel ban.  The list includes billionaire Roman Abramovich, who is trying to sell England's Chelsea soccer club. Abramovich's portfolio of properties includes a Kensington mansion valued at £150 million and a Chelsea Waterfront penthouse bought for £22 million in 2018.  Another on the list is billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who has a multi-million pound property portfolio in the U.K., according to the government.  —CNBC's Karen Gilchrist contributed to this report. "
Columbia University on China helping Russia with impact of sanctions,2022-03-14 09:07:57+00:00,"China will consider its own interests when deciding whether it should help Russia cope with the impact of Western sanctions as a result of the Ukraine war, according to a former deputy sanctions coordinator for the U.S. State Department.  ""The U.S. government will see China as very important here,"" Richard Nephew told CNBC Monday, in responding to a question on how important China's role is in ensuring the efficacy of U.S. sanctions. He added that the Chinese have the ability to offer ""some degree"" of support for Russia as Moscow suffers the fallout from those sanctions.  Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. and European Union have stepped in with sanctions on Russia's banks, central bank and on the assets of its oligarchs. The U.S. last week further imposed bans on Russian oil.  Investors are watching closely to see what China will do as those sanctions hit Russia's economy. Moscow is counting on Beijing for help to cope with the blow to its economy, the Financial Times reported. However, the U.S. is warning China not to support the rogue country.  ""The Chinese are always going to consider their national interests, and they still have a substantial interest in being able to do business in Europe, do business in the United States,"" Nephew told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia.""  ""The degree to which China is seen as undermining the sanctions campaign that the United States or Europe are pursuing may potentially adversely affect that. I think the Chinese are going to hold that pretty seriously.""  Morgan Stanley says these Chinese stocks could rebound — Alibaba, Tencent aren't on the list  Wall Street banks name their favorite Asia stocks — and Citi says one could have upside of 167%  Xpeng and more: Morgan Stanley says these stocks will benefit from rising oil prices  Since Russia's attack on Ukraine, Beijing has refused to call it an invasion and said China would maintain normal trade with both countries. China has not joined U.S., EU and other countries' sanctions on Russia. Last week, however, Premier Li Keqiang said China was ""deeply"" worried about the crisis in Ukraine, and warned that sanctions will hurt global growth.  But if Washington was to ""strong-arm"" Beijing on not supporting Russia, it's ""unlikely to work wonders,"" said Nephew, currently a senior research scholar at Columbia University.  ""But at the same time, I think that they will even set that aside and the frustration, irritation, and with that aside, in order to ensure that their own interests are taken into account,"" he said referring to China.  That could mean not cooperating with Russia quietly, ""but certainly not flagrantly violate U.S., European sanctions on Russia,"" he added.  U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is scheduled for talks Monday with China's top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, to discuss the invasion on Ukraine.  The White House previously said China's trade with Russia isn't enough to offset the impact of U.S. and European sanctions on Moscow. It said China and Russia's share of the global economy is far less than that of the Group of Seven countries — which includes the U.S. and Germany.  China is the largest trade partner for Russia and Ukraine, and trade between China and Russia reached a record high of $146.9 billion in 2021, up 35.8% year-on-year, according to China's customs agency. China's imports from Russia exceeded exports by more than $10 billion last year.  Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow and Russia chair at think-tank Carnegie Moscow Center, said he expects China to be ""religious about observing"" the U.S. and EU sanctions. But Beijing ""will do everything possible"" outside of the scope of the sanctions, he added.  One possibility is that, once the war situation stabilizes, China could seize opportunities to buy Russian oil and gas on the cheap, Gabuev told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Monday.  ""There will be no formal violation of U.S. and EU sanctions, but that will be a significant material lifeline to the regime,"" he said.  — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report. "

UAE is warming to its new Monday to Friday working week,2022-03-14 09:18:32+00:00,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — More than two months since the United Arab Emirates switched to a Monday to Friday working week to be more aligned with international business partners, both the country's natives and its huge population of expats are still getting used to the change, although most say it was a much needed shift.  The country's longstanding Sunday to Thursday work week was officially dropped on Jan. 1. Government employees now work from Monday to Thursday with a flexible half day on Friday, which has long been a sacred day for worshippers of Islam. Friday sermons and prayers, previously held at noon, are now held after 1:15 p.m.  Schools have mirrored this shift and although no specific instructions were given to the private sector, many immediately followed suit.  There had been murmurings among the UAE's business circles for years that the change was coming, and it was viewed by most as inevitable because of globalization. And yet, when the news broke suddenly in early December, it caused a ripple of shock.  Overall, the new UAE work week has been welcomed — with perceived merits ranging from increased ease of doing business to general lifestyle improvement.  For British expat Dan Fahy, managing director of Dubai executive search firm NSI Talent, getting Sundays back as part of the weekend was good news all round.  ""It has been fantastic for me as I'm now aligned with all the geographies I cover and feel like I have five solid days of work rather than a half-baked Sunday and constantly checking my phone on a Friday,"" he told CNBC.  He added: ""I feel like I can fully switch off on a weekend and it's great for watching sports and enjoying a traditional Sunday roast.""  At Dubai's prestigious Moorfields Eye Hospital — a Middle East arm of the famous London eyecare clinic — the change has meant being allowed to open seven days a week.  ""As a health care provider, we understand the importance of being accessible to the public and the new law has allowed us to make changes that bring more convenience to both local and international patients,"" Elhadi Hassan, chief financial officer and managing director at Moorfields Eye Hospital Dubai, UAE told CNBC.   Communicating with international contacts more effectively has been the main upside seen by businesses because schedules are now more in sync.  Laura Manning, the founder and CEO of the BRW Society — an online loose leaf tea seller in the UAE — told CNBC it has allowed her team to enjoy a better work-life balance.   ""In the past, we've had to jump onto calls on a Friday which ate into the weekend. But now we finish what we need to on a Friday morning. The move is helping the team strengthen relationships with suppliers and customers around the world without losing precious free time.""  But the enthusiastic reception of this change doesn't mean it hasn't brought a few corporate headaches, as Annie Meikle, director at Dubai media agency The Social Shop, told CNBC.  ""There have been one or two scheduling blips as we got our heads around a Monday rather than a Sunday start — such as setting up meetings on a Sunday accidentally or forgetting that Friday is a workday, that sort of thing ... But there have been a few laughs because of this.""  She added: ""But as we often deal with global contacts, we can now work more easily with other markets such as the U.K. and North America, which is a real bonus.""  For Dubai's economically crucial hospitality sector, the transition has been relatively seamless, although there were initial angst-ridden comments online about what would happen to the legendary Friday brunch — an eye-popping all-you-can-eat-and-drink affair that the big UAE hotels offer.  To the relief of many, brunch is still on the menu — it has simply moved to Saturday.  ""From a business perspective the transition has been relatively seamless, although it did take a couple of weeks for food and beverage operations to adjust to things like a Saturday brunch,"" Marcus Sutton, general manager at upscale hotel Zabeel House by Jumeirah, The Greens, told CNBC.  He added: ""With Fridays also being a half day for many offices, and in particular for the schools, we have seen an upward trend in early afternoon business in our outlets on Friday which has helped create a long weekend benefit for the business.""  ""From a rooms perspective, the change has also seen the creation of weekend demand over a three day period instead of the two — given the difference now in weekend days between the UAE and surrounding GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] countries.""  ""Overall, the change has been a positive one and appreciated within the hospitality sector,"" he added.       "
Sri Lankan opposition says government lost its legitimacy after debt crisis,2022-03-14 08:04:03+00:00,"The Sri Lankan government has lost its ""legitimacy"" for the way it handled the country's debt crisis and the related economic problems, according to a representative from the main opposition party.  Harsha de Silva, a member of parliament at Sri Lanka's Samagi Jana Balavegaya, said the party intends to organize a mass demonstration on March 15 at the capital Colombo, to step up pressure on the government.  ""This protest is going to happen and we're going to force the government to step down. In our view, there is no legitimacy for this government,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday.  He also criticized the country's finance minister Basil Rohana Rajapakse for not addressing the debt issue in parliament.  ""The finance minister has not even come to parliament and spoken about the crisis for three months. And parliament, in a democracy, is where these discussions should happen,"" he said, adding it is ""utterly irresponsible"" as to how the government ""is handling the crisis.""  The South Asian nation is struggling with the dual challenge of rising prices and high external debt, and Sri Lankans are bearing the brunt of an increasingly grim economic crisis.  Reuters reported that the government is set to begin talks with the International Monetary Fund in April, to come up with a plan to deal with the country's worsening debt problems and manage its foreign exchange shortage.  Last week, Sri Lanka's central bank governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal told CNBC his country would be able to pull through the current challenges, but stressed the importance of measures that may not be very palatable. He added the central bank has proposed a package of measures to the Sri Lankan government to help alleviate shortages and curb inflation.  De Silva said the country's debt is not on a sustainable path and blamed the government for implementing policies that aggravated the current domestic issues.  ""One being the unnecessary tax cuts and the other being an overnight ban on chemical fertilizers and all other agricultural inputs — it created a massive shock,"" he said, referring to the tax cuts imposed by the government in 2019, which led to a significant drop in tax revenues during the pandemic.  Citing environmental reasons, the government placed a ban on chemical fertilizer imports last year, which led to protests from farmers. As a result, the government was forced to reverse its decision and has reportedly lifted the ban.  ""The opposition have been pushing to have a proper discussion with the IMF, so that we can avoid a hard default and to negotiate a pre-emptive restructuring with bondholders, "" de Silva said. ""I hope the powers-that-be listen to the sane advice."" "
Op-ed: Crippling sanctions aren't enough — Here's what needs to be done to stop Putin,2022-03-14 00:29:44+00:00,"It isn't yet enough.  The impressive defensive weapon deliveries to Ukraine's military, though crucial to the country's remarkable resistance and resilience, haven't been enough to stop Putin's mounting airstrikes on civilian targets and urban centers.  The unprecedented economic and financial sanctions on Russia, though historic in their scope and reach, have been insufficient to deter President Vladimir Putin from escalating his grinding war on Ukraine.  They aren't enough.  The unanticipated transatlantic and international unity – including a 141-5 resolution of the United Nations General Assembly that demands Putin end his war and withdraw his forces – hasn't dissuaded Putin. What greater sign could there have been that Putin has made himself a pariah than the quartet that voted with him: Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, and Syria?  Still, that's not enough.  Too many countries in the world continue to look away. A full 35 countries at the United Nations abstained from condemning Russia, hoping Putin's ugliness would pass without forcing them to take a stand against this international crime.  The efforts of the United States and some of our international partners to shame Chinese President Xi Jinping into pulling his support from Putin's war machine also have failed, though no country's actions at this moment could do more to save lives and end the war.  Putin got the Chinese green light he sought for his invasion from President Xi in their 5,300-word statement as the Beijing Winter Olympics opened, saying their relationship had ""no limits."" Putin kept his part of the bargain – not invading until Xi's Olympics had ended. Xi doesn't yet seem willing to distance himself from Putin in any meaningful way.  What the civilized world has done thus far to answer Putin's invasion is a remarkable show of unity. The Biden administration deserves credit for releasing the intelligence on Putin's plans early, thus focusing the narrative and blame where it belongs, and then rallying the world thereafter.  Europe's combined actions against Putin are particularly impressive, given its proximity to Moscow and dependence on Russian energy. Germany did more in a weekend than in the previous two decades to counter Russian revanchism: reversing a ban on selling weapons to Ukraine, significantly increasing its defense spending to 2% of GDP and a special $100 billion spending plan for the Bundeswehr in its 2022 budget.  If all that remains insufficient to change Putin's course, the only responsible choice is to do more and to do it quickly: more sanctions, more military support, more international unity.  There are two compelling reasons why.  The first is humanitarian: Putin's relentless air attacks on Ukrainian civilians have prompted Europe's biggest refugee crisis since World War II.  The second is the historic imperative: The need to reverse a global trajectory that could allow brutal authoritarianism or bloody chaos to shape the global future.  ""Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has ended Americans' 30-year holiday from history,"" writes Robert M. Gates in the Washington Post, applying his perspective from eight U.S. administrations, including stints as Secretary of Defense and CIA Director. ""For the first time since World War II, the United States faces powerful, aggressive adversaries in Europe and Asia seeking to recover past glory with claimed territories and spheres of influence. …Putin's war has provided the cold shower needed to awaken democratic governments to the reality of a new world, a world in which our recent strategy is woefully insufficient to meet the long-term challenges we face.""  It is clarifying and galvanizing to view Putin's war on Ukraine in these terms, not as a dangerous episode but as an epochal challenge.  With that in mind, what should be done?  The Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security provided some actionable military ideas through a survey of 37 leading national security experts. They assessed them by weighing the positive benefits against the risk of escalation.  The best of the lot included:  Beyond that, I also favor a partial no-fly zone over the most Western provinces of Ukraine, close to the Polish, Slovakian, Hungarian and Romanian borders. One can understand why the U.S. and NATO reject a no-fly zone over the whole of Ukraine, but in Western Ukraine it is a humanitarian imperative, it is militarily easier as it's closer to western air bases and it would demonstrate our resolve to Putin.  At the same time, the U.S., Europe, and their global partners should add to the impressive array of sanctions against Russia.  Their impact thus far, writes the Council's Brian O'Toole and Daniel Fried ""has been to flatten the Russian financial system, crash the ruble, spur a likely sovereign default, and probably move the Russian economy into a depression.""  Yet as Putin's forces continue their attack, targeting civilians and turning urban centers to dust, O'Toole and Fried provide a menu, in ascending order of impact, of next steps:  What's not in doubt is that Putin will continue to escalate, if not more is done to stop him.   ""I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now,"" CIA Director William Burns told the House Intelligence Committee last week. ""He's likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties.""  Putin has lost: He will never be able to entirely pacify and occupy Ukraine, and he has done generational damage to Russia, whose power and prestige he was determined to build. Yet his opponents have not won. Saving Ukraine and sustaining their newfound common cause is the key to shaping the global future.  To achieve that, what has been accomplished against Putin thus far is remarkable, but it is still insufficient.  —Frederick Kempe is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Atlantic Council.

China slams firms for falsifying carbon data,2022-03-14 06:56:41+00:00,"China's environment ministry has slammed firms for falsifying carbon data, part of the country's efforts to improve data quality as it prepares to expand its national emissions trading scheme into more industrial sectors.  The findings published on Monday follow a campaign launched by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) in October-December last year aimed at ascertaining the accuracy of carbon emission verification reports submitted across the country.  ""Accurate and reliable data is the lifeline for the effective and standardized operation of the carbon emissions trading market,"" the MEE said in a statement on Monday.  China, the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter, put its repeatedly delayed national emission trading scheme (ETS) into operation in July last year. But the transparency and accuracy of emissions data remain a big concern for Beijing as well as the market's participants.  Four data verification firms — Zhongchuang Nengtou Co, SinoCarbon Innovation & Investment Co, Qingdao Xinuo Renewable Co and Liaoning Dongmei Testing and Analysis Research Institute — were charged by the ministry with ""tampering with and forging test reports"", ""making false coal samples"", and ""writing distorted and inaccurate conclusions"".  Reuters could not immediately reach the four companies by telephone.  Morgan Stanley says these Chinese stocks could rebound — Alibaba, Tencent aren't on the list  Wall Street banks name their favorite Asia stocks — and Citi says one could have upside of 167%  Xpeng and more: Morgan Stanley says these stocks will benefit from rising oil prices  The MEE also said it will urge local environment bureaus to continue investigating the four firms and will further strengthen the supervision and management of carbon data verification companies.  China's current ETS currently includes about 2,000 enterprises in the power sector, which emit close to 4.5 billion tones of carbon dioxide each year, or 40% of the country's total.  The government is considering slashing the carbon emission allowances to power utilities to avoid a market surplus, and it is also expected to widen market coverage to include emitters from sectors such as steelmaking.

"Ukraine war must end, Russia's fertilizer and coal king says",2022-03-14 06:55:23+00:00,"The war in Ukraine is a tragedy that must be stopped or there will be a global food crisis, as fertilizer prices worldwide are already too high for many farmers, Russia's coal and fertilizer king Andrei Melnichenko said on Monday.  Several of Russia's richest businessmen have publicly called for peace since President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion on Feb. 24, including Mikhail Fridman, Pyotr Aven and Oleg Deripaska.  The United States and its European allies cast Putin's invasion as an imperial-style land grab that has so far been poorly executed because Moscow under-estimated Ukrainian resistance and Western resolve to punish Russia.  The West has sanctioned Russian businessmen, including European Union sanctions on Melnichenko, frozen state assets and cut off much of the Russian corporate sector from the global economy in an attempt to force Putin to change course.  Putin refuses to.  ""The events in Ukraine are truly tragic. We urgently need peace,"" Melnichenko, 50, who is Russian but was born in Belarus and has a Ukrainian mother, told Reuters in a statement emailed by his spokesman.  ""As a Russian by nationality, a Belarusian by birth, and a Ukrainian by blood, I feel great pain and disbelief witnessing brotherly peoples fighting and dying.""  Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:  Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands, displaced more than 2 million people, and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers.  Putin says Russians and Ukrainians are essentially one people and that a ""special military operation"" was needed because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia while Russian-speakers were being persecuted in Ukraine.  ""One of the victims of this crisis will be agriculture and food,"" said Melnichenko, who founded Uralchem, Russia's largest ammonium nitrate producer which is based in Zug, Switzerland, and SUEK, Russia's top coal producer.  ""It has already led to soaring prices in fertilizers which are no longer affordable to farmers.""  Melnichenko said a supply chain already disrupted by Covid-19 was now even more distressed. ""Now it will lead to even higher food inflation in Europe and likely food shortages in the world's poorest countries,"" he said. "
"Russia-Ukraine war: impact on shipping, ports, air freight",2022-03-11 05:39:35+00:00,"The Russia-Ukraine war is severely disrupting shipping and air freight. Russian forces are cutting off shipping routes, logistics firms are suspending services and air freight rates are skyrocketing, supply chain firms said.  Russian naval forces have closed shipping in and out of the Sea of Azov — one of the few access points to ocean trade in Ukraine, said Dylan Alperin, head of professional services at supply chain software platform Keelvar.  ""This has created a heavy buildup of vessels waiting to get through the Kerch strait. With 70% of Ukraine's exports distributed via ship, the congestion is worsening by the hour,"" he told CNBC.  Christian Roeloffs, CEO of container booking firm Container xChange, said: ""Parts of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov are now dangerous or unpassable. There have been missile attacks on vessels and ship arrests and lane closures for commercial shipping.""  The situation on the ground in Ukraine is extremely fluid, and reports from the area are difficult or impossible to confirm.  ""Multiple ships have been hit by munitions, seafarers have been killed and injured and seafarers of all nationalities are trapped on ships berthed in ports,"" the International Chamber of Shipping warned on Thursday.  Supply chain firms told CNBC that cargo movements are at a standstill as the Ukrainian ports of Odessa and Mariupol are closed, damaged or under attack. Roeloffs added that container movements have stopped, with cargo stuck at ports.  The port of Odessa is Ukraine's largest and a major grain export port. The country is one of the biggest exporters of grains such as wheat, barley and corn. Russia and Ukraine account for about 29% of the global wheat export market.  Mariupol, an important port city and industrial center, has been experiencing heavy shelling.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now in its third week, and fighting continues in major cities.  Limited air capacity presents a double whammy for shippers. With airspace over Ukraine closed to civilian flights and airlines avoiding Russian airspace, air freight rates are spiking, according to the firms.  ""The flying ban has canceled many of these flights and removed 10 million miles of airspace from international freight routes,"" Alperin said. ""With airlines responsible for flying around 20% of cargo, this will dramatically decrease capacity provided by carriers.""  Judah Levine, head of research at freight booking company Freightos Group, said that as airlines avoid Russian airspace, they will take alternate, longer routes — jacking up fuel costs.  Record price spikes for oil will worsen the already bad outlook for carriers as fuel costs rise, Alperin said. ""We're in for record backlogs and delays while experiencing some of the highest prices on record for transportation and beyond.""  Oil prices have been rising for weeks and surging to record levels.  Levine said that the Freightos Air Index's China-to-Europe rates climbed more than 80% in late February to $11.36/kg, with some carriers already imposing war risk surcharges.  Bindiya Vakil, CEO of supply chain risk management firm Resilinc, said some insurers are also increasing premiums for shipping goods in the Black Sea.  Many logistics companies have also suspended deliveries to and from Russia as well as Ukraine, while container shipping firms are shunning Russia.  DHL said it has closed offices and operations in Ukraine until further notice, while UPS told CNBC that it has suspended services to and from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.  Alperin noted that the growing number of carriers that have suspended services in Russia make up about 62% of total ocean freight capacity.  Meanwhile, tanker rates have ""skyrocketed,"" with a spike from 157% to 591%, said Alperin.  The International Chamber of Shipping warned on Thursday that the supply chain disruptions are set to be worsened by a shortfall in shipping crew due to the war.  Ukrainian and Russian seafarers account for 14.5% of the global shipping workforce, it said.  ""To maintain this unfettered trade, seafarers must be able to join and disembark ships (crew change) freely across the world. However, flights have been cancelled to and from the region, making this increasingly difficult,"" it said in a statement. It added that some crews have abandoned their ships in Ukraine due to security worries.  ""Fears over crew safety and increasing insurance premiums to send ships to Ukraine or Russia have also discouraged shipowners from sending vessels to these countries,"" the association added.  In February, the association, which represents 80% of global merchant fleets, said ""the ability to pay seafarers also needs to be maintained via international banking systems.""  The United States, European allies and Canada have agreed to cut off key Russian banks from the interbank messaging system, SWIFT, which connects more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories.  As the value of the Russian ruble drops, that's also set to have other knock-on effects.  ""With the Ruble devaluation, a lot of Russian companies cannot afford to pay for merchandise that is in ships and it is going to cause a lot of abandoned shipments and unpaid debts for orders on the water,"" said James Coombes, CEO at digital freight forwarder company Vector.ai. ""Freight forwarders are going to get stuck with a lot of unpaid freight bills."" "
Russia could be about to default on its debt: Here's what you need to know,2022-03-15 14:33:23+00:00,"Russia could be about to default on its foreign currency debts for the first time in decades, likely beginning a drawn out wrangling process with international bodies.  International sanctions on the Central Bank of Russia in response to the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine have blocked off a substantial portion of the country's foreign exchange reserves, which it would ordinarily use to service sovereign debt obligations.  Measures taken by Moscow to mitigate the impact — such as capital controls — have led major ratings agencies to downgrade Russia's government debt, concluding that a debt default is now highly likely.  This would mark Russia's first sovereign default since 1998, when it defaulted on domestic debt, and the first sovereign default on foreign currency debt since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1918.  Here's a quick CNBC guide to what's going on:  The Russian state is due to pay $117 million in interest on two sovereign eurobonds on Wednesday, the first of four payment dates to creditors in March alone, but economists remain uncertain as to exactly how Moscow will meet its debt obligations.  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov indicated on Monday that Russia will use its reserves of Chinese yuan to make some of its payments, with euros and dollars now inaccessible due to sanctions.  Alternatively, the government has warned that payments to creditors from ""hostile"" countries will be made in rubles, with the currency having depreciated sharply since the invasion of Ukraine.  William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, explained in a note Monday that although some Russian FX bonds — those issued from 2018 — permit payments in rubles if they are not able to be made in other currencies, this does not apply to Wednesday's payments.  Jackson suggested that attempting to pay in rubles would therefore be tantamount to a default, though subject to a 30-day grace period before it became official.  Western governments actually have an interest in Russia running down its remaining accessible foreign currency assets to pay creditors. This further erodes free Russian FX assets, according to Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management.  ""At present the message seems to be that the Ministry of Finance is willing and able to pay, but is being prevented from doing so by sanctions on the CBR, so the message from Russia is if the West wants Western creditors to be paid, then sanctions on the CBR need to be freed/eased,"" Ash noted in an email Monday.  ""It has even issued a directive saying that it will make payment in FX for debt service through foreign correspondent banks, but if these banks are unable to transact with the CBR because of sanctions, then monies owed will be paid in rubles but held at the National Security Depository (NSD) and payment then made at some point in the future via so called 'S' accounts.""  This, Ash said, would likely constitute a default, but Russia's finance ministry would then argue that it tried to pay but was prevented from completing the transaction due to sanctions.  ""While in one respect the MOF would like not to be able to pay their foreign creditors as this a) saves now scarce FX reserves; b) hurts investors in adversary nations, and they then hope these will lobby their own governments for sanctions relief, the downside is that non payment and potential default would have serious and long run consequences for Russia,"" Ash added.  A failure to pay would see Russian ratings cut to default status by the agencies, which would be prolonged due to difficulties in ensuring quick debt restructuring. This would keep Russian borrowing costs elevated and limit financing options, even from the likes of China, Ash suggested.  ""Even should the war end quickly, and peace be resolved, markets and ratings agencies will remember this crisis for some time and ratings will be slow to recover, and Russian borrowing costs slow to moderate. This will crimp Russian economic development for years to come,"" he added.  Come Wednesday, Ash projected that some of the money will likely have been paid, perhaps with some delay, but it remains unclear whether foreign investors will be able to access it, and in which currency.  Russia and the rating agencies will also have to debate whether this constitutes a default, a dispute that he suggested may end up in the courts.  Capital Economics' Jackson suggested that while the default is largely priced in for foreign investors, and Russia's strong public finances mean the government is not hugely dependent on foreign financing, Russian corporate debt could come under threat.  ""Perhaps the bigger risk is that it may be a prelude to defaults by Russian corporates, whose external debts are more than four times larger than those of the sovereign,"" he said.  ""So far, Russian corporates seem to have continued servicing their debts since sanctions were tightened, but with trade disrupted, sanctions potentially being widened and the economy set for a deep recession, the likelihood of corporate defaults is rising.""  BlackRock and Pimco have already been identified among the many global fund managers with exposure to Russian debt, though most of these positions have been marked down and are already reflected in the fund prices.  Economists have broadly dismissed fears of a global contagion effect if Russia defaults. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in an interview on Sunday that global banks' $120 billion exposure to Russia is ""not systematically relevant.""  Jackson also noted that overseas creditors had largely marked down their holdings, while pointing out that the overall size of Russian foreign currency sovereign debt held by non-residents is ""relatively small"" at around $20 billion.

Live updates: Latest news on Russia and the war in Ukraine,2022-03-16 05:26:08+00:00,"This is CNBC's live blog tracking developments on the war in Ukraine. See below for the latest updates.   U.S. President Joe Biden plans to travel to Brussels next week to meet with NATO allies about bolstering support for Ukraine as it fights to fend off Russia's unprovoked attack.  The ""extraordinary summit"" on March 24 will bring together North American and European leaders to discuss ""further strengthening NATO's deterrence & defence,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.   The alliance is expected to call on its military commanders Wednesday to send more troops and missile defenses to eastern Europe, Reuters reported. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also scheduled to address U.S. lawmakers Wednesday morning.   Russia is transferring troops to Ukraine from as far away as its Pacific Fleet and is recruiting more mercenaries as it tries to replace lost personnel, according to an assessment from the U.K. Defence Ministry.  ""As a result of these losses, it is likely Russia is struggling to conduct offensive operations in the face of sustained Ukrainian resistance,"" the ministry said. ""Continued personnel losses will also make it difficult for Russia to secure occupied territory.""  Russia's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  It is unclear how many Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine since the invasion began in late February. Ukraine officials said over the weekend that Ukraine has lost 1,300 soldiers.  Moscow is redeploying troops from as far away as Armenia, its Eastern Military District, and the Russian Pacific Fleet, the ministry said.  The Pacific Fleet is based in Vladivostok, Russia. By air, Vladivostok is more than 4,400 miles (7,100 km) from Kyiv.  The U.K. Defence Ministry said Russia is seeking mercenaries from Syria and ""private military companies,"" the term used to describe Russia-based firms that hire out armed fighters.  Moscow will likely use those mercenaries to hold seized Ukrainian territory so it can shift more of its regular troops to fight Ukrainian forces and ""renew stalled offensive operations,"" the U.K. ministry said.  Russian corporate fighters have been accused of committing human rights abuses in Syria, Libya and the Central African Republic while working on behalf of Moscow.  Such mercenary services already operated in eastern Ukraine prior to Russia's current invasion, according to the U.S. government.  In 2017, the U.S. Treasury placed sanctions on the biggest Russian mercenary company, PMC Wagner, and its founder, Dmitriy Utkin, for ""actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine.""  The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said last year that Moscow provided security and military services through private mercenary companies to the government of the Central African Republic in exchange for the right to extract gold, uranium and diamonds.  — Ted Kemp  First responders work in a building that was struck by a Grad rocket attack in Kharkiv.  -Adam Jeffery  NATO is set to tell its military commanders on Wednesday to draw up plans for new ways to deter Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, including more troops and missile defenses in eastern Europe, officials and diplomats said.  Defense ministers will order the military advice at NATO headquarters, just over a week before allied leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, gather in Brussels on March 24.  Ministers will also hear from their Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov, who is expected to plead for more weapons from individual NATO countries, as Russian attacks on Ukraine's cities continue and the Russian military seeks control of Kyiv.  ""We need to reset our military posture for this new reality,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier Tuesday. ""Ministers will start an important discussion on concrete measures to reinforce our security for the longer term, in all domains,"" he told reporters.  — Reuters  A second journalist on assignment for Fox News in Ukraine has died, the television news network confirmed.  Oleksandra Kuvshynova, affectionately called Sasha, died alongside cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski after their vehicle was struck by incoming fire on Monday.  The confirmation of Kuvshynova's death follows that of Zakrzewski.  ""Sasha was just 24 years old and was serving as a consultant for us in Ukraine. She was helping our crews navigate Kyiv and the surrounding area while gathering information and speaking to sources. She was incredibly talented and spent weeks working directly with our entire team there, operating around the clock to make sure the world knew what was happening in her country,"" CEO Suzanne Scott wrote in a statement.  ""Her dream was to connect people around the world and tell their stories and she fulfilled that through her journalism,"" Scott wrote.  — Amanda Macias  The State Department said the U.S. is prepared to engage with Russia on ending the war in Ukraine, but Moscow has yet to take negotiations seriously.  ""We have yet to find a Russian interlocutor that is either able or willing to negotiate in good faith and certainly not in the context of de-escalation,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said.  ""A number of our partners are engaged directly with the Russian Federation at high levels. I think what is clear is that none of these engagements have yet resulted in a diminution of violence or in a reduction of the loss of life that we've seen across Ukraine,"" Price added.  President Joe Biden last spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12., nearly two weeks before Russian troops began their invasion of Ukraine.  — Amanda Macias  Russian forces have launched more than 950 missiles since the start of the Ukraine invasion, a senior U.S. Defense official said, adding that the Pentagon has observed a steady rise in missile launches amid stalled ground movements.  The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Russian arsenal includes short-range, medium-range, ballistic and cruise missiles.   The official said ""Kyiv remains under bombardment by long-range fires"" and targets include residential areas. The official said Russian forces have not appreciably advanced on Kyiv and are approximately 10 miles northwest of the capital and about 13 miles to the east.  — Amanda Macias  Lobbyists are working to connect Ukrainian officials with powerful allies in the U.S., including mayors, governors and representatives of at least one firearms dealer, in an effort to help the war-torn country in its fight against Russia.  At least one U.S. firm and a separate lawyer each recently disclosed to the Department of Justice's Foreign Agents Registration Act unit that they started pro-bono work for Ukrainian government officials since the start of Russia's invasion. These advisors have started to help Ukrainian leaders as Western sanctions have led lobbyists to distance themselves from Russian-backed entities. The powerful lobbying firm Sidley Austin dropped VTB Bank as a client after the Biden administration sanctioned the financial institution.  Your Global Strategy, a lobbying and communications firm co-founded by international political strategists Shai Franklin and Michael Steiner, is working to connect local Ukrainian government officials with American mayors and governors, Franklin told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday. He later noted that he is the sole lobbyist from Your Global Strategy working on this effort.  Steiner previously worked closely with Russia as the Moscow-Russia CEO for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, winning a special citation from the Russian Federation for ""contributions to the development of nationalities,"" according to his bio.  — Brian Schwartz  A large Russian military convoy, widely tracked by satellite imagery, appears to have made little progress for nearly a week, according to U.S. military estimates.  ""We have no updates on the convoy. It is still stuck,"" a senior U.S. Defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters Tuesday when asked about the latest satellite imagery provided by Maxar Technologies.  Last week, the official told reporters that ""the convoy is not really going anywhere"" and that it was not immediately clear how many vehicles are in the Russian convoy.  — Amanda Macias  White House press secretary Jen Psaki had a strong warning for Russian oligarchs: the United States and its Western allies are not done seizing their yachts.  ""That is just the beginning,"" Psaki said after she confirmed U.S. allies had seized a number of yachts around the world.   President Joe Biden's administration recently announced a taskforce that would seek to deprive Russian oligarchs of assets and other tools used to evade sanctions following their country's invasion of Ukraine.  Psaki confirmed that five additional yachts owned by Russia's wealthiest executives have been seized by authorities, including a nearly 300-foot superyacht owned by Sergey Chemezov. Psaki said the yacht was seized in Spain. Chemezov, the CEO of Russian conglomerate Rostec, was sanctioned by Biden's administration.  The yacht is named Valerie and is worth about $100 million, according to Superyacht Fan.  — Brian Schwartz  U.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Brussels for a March 24 NATO summit about how to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the White House said.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Biden will discuss ""ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine, as well as to reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies.""  NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced what he called an ""extraordinary"" meeting earlier in the day.  ""We will address #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO's deterrence & defence,"" Stoltenberg wrote in a tweet. ""At this critical time, North America & Europe must continue to stand together.""  — Jacob Pramuk  Pierre Zakrzewski, a cameraman for Fox News, was killed on Monday while reporting from Ukraine, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott announced to employees in a memo.  ""It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that we share the news this morning regarding our beloved cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski. Pierre was killed in Horenka, outside of Kyiv, Ukraine. Pierre was with Benjamin Hall yesterday newsgathering when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire,"" Scott wrote.  Scott wrote that Zakrzewski, a long-time war zone photographer with dispatches from Iraq and Syria, traveled to Ukraine in February. She said he had ""vast"" talents and ""did it all under immense pressure.""   Scott offered condolences to Zakrzewski's family and noted that Benjamin Hall, a Fox correspondent injured in Ukraine, remains hospitalized.   On Sunday, award-winning American filmmaker and journalist Brett Renaud was killed in Ukraine, the first U.S. reporter to die in the conflict.  — Amanda Macias  The United States imposed sanctions on Russians it accused of gross human rights violations and slapped fresh measures on Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, increasing pressure on Moscow and its close ally amid the war in Ukraine.  The U.S. Treasury Department said it was imposing sanctions on four people and one entity it accused of playing a role in concealing events around the death of whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky or of being connected to human rights violations against human rights advocate Oyub Titiev.  The Treasury statement also said it was adding to its sanctions against Lukashenko and also targeting his wife.   — Reuters  Russia said has barred U.S. President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other top officials  from entering the country.  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was also named to Russia's ""stop list"" along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, CIA chief William Burns and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. They were included on a list of 13 individuals banned from Russia in response to sanctions imposed by Washington on Russian officials.   But the foreign ministry said it was maintaining official relations with Washington and if necessary would make sure that high-level contacts with the people on the list could take place.  — Reuters  NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the 30-member military alliance has no plans to shift mobile nuclear-capable weapons systems closer to Russia's borders, disputing a previous claim by Moscow.  In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin placed his nation's nuclear forces on high alert amid tensions with the West over his invasion of Ukraine. At the time, Putin said he ordered the elevation because of ""aggressive statements"" made against Russia by NATO.   ""We have no plans to deploy nuclear-capable intermediate-range land-based systems in Europe,"" Stoltenberg said ahead of a two-day NATO defense ministers meeting.  ""At the same time, we need to be able to make sure that we are able to respond and protect all allies in the new security environment where Russia has deployed more nuclear-capable missiles,"" he said, adding that the alliance would invest in ""readiness and the ability to monitor and detect"" missile threats.  ""We also need to make sure that NATO's nuclear deterrence remains safe and secure and effective and that's exactly what we're doing,"" he added.  — Amanda Macias  Rescuers remove debris from a residential building damaged by an airstrike in the city of Kharkiv, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues.  — Adam Jeffery  NATO is increasingly concerned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is considering the use of chemical weapons in his invasion of Ukraine, the alliance's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.   Stoltenberg said that the Kremlin has started to spread false propaganda that Ukraine and its allies are developing chemical weapons, leading the NATO chief to worry whether Putin himself is weighing the use of the illegal munitions.  ""Any use of chemical weapons will be a violation of international law,"" Stoltenberg said at a news conference from NATO headquarters in Brussels. ""We are concerned Moscow could stage a false flag operation in Ukraine, possibly with chemical weapons.""  — Thomas Franck  President Joe Biden is slated to sign into law a massive $1.5 trillion omnibus spending package that contains aid for Ukraine.  The 2,741-page bipartisan appropriation measure, known as H.R. 2471 or the Consolidated Appropriations Act, also includes $13.6 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.  ""We will make sure Ukraine has weapons to defend against the invading Russian force. We will send money and food and aid to save Ukrainian lives. We will welcome Ukrainian refugees with open arms,"" Biden said via Twitter.  — Amanda Macias  President Joe Biden's ambassador to NATO called on all countries to make clear where they stand amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.  ""This is not a time for countries to sit on the sidelines. This is not a time for countries to pretend like they could stay neutral on this particular conflict,"" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on a call with reporters.  Smith's comments follow an intense seven-hour meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Rome on Monday. The U.S. delegation, led by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, conveyed to Beijing's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, that China should not assist Russia amid the Kremlin's ongoing war in Ukraine.  ""The goal of that engagement was to really send a pretty clear message that the United States is keen to see every country around the world and that includes the PRC to make clear in this moment where they stand with respect to this conflict in Ukraine,"" Smith said, referring to the People's Republic of China.   ""And that they need to stand on the side of the rules-based order,"" she added.  — Amanda Macias  Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a participant in talks with Russian officials, has said negotiations are continuing after a fourth round on Monday.  — Chloe Taylor  U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will travel to Belgium for an in-person meeting of NATO defense ministers as the alliance looks to bolster Ukraine in its effort to fight off Russia's invasion.  Following the two-day gathering in Brussels, Austin will travel to NATO member states Slovakia and Bulgaria.  ""We're thrilled to welcome back the secretary this evening and have him here tomorrow for two sessions. We'll cover the situation in Ukraine but we'll also be talking about some longer-term questions about how NATO should be positioning itself in the future,"" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on a call with reporters Tuesday.  — Amanda Macias  Mariupol City Council has said 2,000 cars had left the city as of 2 p.m. local time on Tuesday.  A further 2,000 cars were ""parked at the exit from the city,"" the authority said in a Telegram post.  Mariupol was one of several Ukrainian cities to have a humanitarian corridor opened on Tuesday for the evacuation of civilians and the import of vital supplies like water and medicine.  Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been trapped by heavy combat in the besieged city, the Red Cross said over the weekend. Early attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol had to be halted because Ukrainian authorities said Russian forces had violated cease-fire agreements in the city.  Mariupol is crucial in the war for Ukraine, as its capture could help Russian forces create a land corridor to Crimea — a peninsula in the country's south that Moscow invaded and annexed in 2014.  — Chloe Taylor  Four people were killed in Russian missile strikes on Kyiv this morning, the city's Mayor Vitali Klitschko has said.  Several residential buildings were hit in the attacks on the Ukrainian capital, with high-rise apartment buildings catching fire after the strikes.  Klitschko said in a Telegram post on Tuesday afternoon that emergency services were still working to extinguish a fire in Kyiv's Sviatoshynskyi district hours after the attack.  ""We will defend our city — we never think to leave. It's our home,"" he told reporters in a video posted to his Telegram account.  — Chloe Taylor  Aleina gives birth to her baby in the basement of a maternity hospital as sirens warn for Russian air raids in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, on Monday.   The finance ministers of France, Germany and the Netherlands have spoken to CNBC's Silvia Amaro about the EU's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the potential economic ramifications of European sanctions on Moscow.  — Chloe Taylor  The number of refugees who have fled Ukraine since the start of the war has reached 2.95 million, the U.N.'s human rights office said Tuesday.  It came as the U.N. children's charity UNICEF said more than 1.5 million children had become refugees since the conflict began 20 days ago — equating to one child refugee per second.  On average, more than 75,000 children were becoming refugees every day as the war in Ukraine raged on, the organization said.  ""So long as this war continues, the situation for Ukraine's children will only get worse,"" UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said at a press briefing in Geneva, Switzerland.  — Chloe Taylor  The U.K. and the EU both revoked Russia's ""most favored nation"" trading status on Tuesday, paving the way for Russian goods to be subject to harsh import tariffs.  ""Most-favored nation"" status is a classification within the World Trade Organization that exempts a country from tariffs.  Britain's government said Tuesday that it would ban exports of high-end luxury goods to Russia, while hitting hundreds of imports from the country with new tariffs.  It published an initial list of Russian and Belarusian goods worth £900 million that would now be subject to an additional 35% import tariff on top of existing levies. Products on the list include vodka, fur, cement and several metals.  The move to ban the export of goods such as luxury vehicles, high-end fashion and works of art was a coordinated effort being undertaken by G-7 nations, and would come into force soon, the U.K. government said.  Meanwhile, EU lawmakers on Tuesday approved several new measures, including a ban on transactions with certain Russian state-owned businesses, a ban on Russian steel imports, a ban on new investments in Russia's energy sector and an export ban on luxury goods to Russia.  Banning imports of Russian steel to the EU would amount to 3.3 billion euros ($3.63 billion) in lost export revenue for Russia, the EU said.  — Chloe Taylor  Fresh bombings across Ukraine have led to multiple civilian deaths, Ukrainian authorities said Tuesday.  Vitalii Koval, head of the Rivne regional state administration, said on Telegram that 19 people had died following an airstrike on a television tower in the region yesterday, while a further nine had been wounded.  Meanwhile, the Ukrainian State Emergency Services said Tuesday that two people had died in Kyiv's Sviatoshyno district when a 16-storey residential building caught fire following a Russian shelling attack.  — Chloe Taylor  Nine humanitarian corridors have been opened in Ukraine to evacuate civilians from besieged towns and cities, the country's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced Tuesday.  The safe routes will also allow the import of humanitarian aid, including tons of water and medicine.  Cities where evacuations are planned include Mariupol, Sumy, Trostyanets and three villages in the Kyiv region.  ""We promise not to leave anyone behind,"" Vereshchuk said in a statement. ""We remember, we know and we really want to save you.""  Some evacuation attempts in recent weeks have had to be abandoned, with Ukrainian authorities saying Russian forces had violated cease-fire agreements and attacked the safe routes out of certain cities.  — Chloe Taylor  Mayor of Kyiv Vitaliy Klitschko has announced a 35-hour curfew in the Ukrainian capital starting Tuesday evening.  From 8 p.m. local time on Tuesday until 7 a.m. Thursday, Kyiv residents will be prohibited from moving through the city without a special pass, and will only be allowed to leave their homes to reach bomb shelters.  Klitschko said in a Telegram post Tuesday morning that the decision had been made by military command because the city had found itself in ""a difficult and dangerous moment.""""I ask all Kyivites to prepare for the fact that they will have to be at home for two days or, in case of an alarm, in a shelter,"" he said.  — Chloe Taylor  Talks between Russia and Ukraine are expected to continue Tuesday following a fourth round of negotiations yesterday.  Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a participant in the talks, said Monday that the negotiations had taken ""a technical pause … until tomorrow.""  He said a break was being taken to carry out ""additional work in the working subgroups and clarification of individual definitions.""  — Chloe Taylor  The prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic — all members of both NATO and the EU — will travel to Kyiv today to meet with Ukraine's president and prime minister.  Poland's deputy prime minister will also join the delegation.  Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and his Czech counterpart Petr Fiala both said in statements Monday morning that the visit had been organized in consultation with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  The U.N. had also been informed of the visit, they said.  ""The purpose of the visit is to confirm the unequivocal support of the entire European Union for the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,"" the statements added. ""The aim of this visit is also to present a broad package of support for the Ukraine and Ukrainians.""  — Chloe Taylor  ""Reporting suggests that Russia may seek to stage a 'referendum' in Kherson in an attempt to legitimize the area as a 'breakaway republic' similar to Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update on Tuesday.  Kherson, the first major Ukrainian city to be captured by forces after Russia launched its invasion, has been the scene of protests against Russian occupation in recent weeks. The U.K.'s intel update on Tuesday said that further protests were seen in the city yesterday, with Russian forces reportedly firing warning shots in an attempt to disperse peaceful protesters.  Elsewhere, Russia is reported to have installed its own mayor in the city of Melitopol, according to the U.K., following the reported abduction of the city's elected mayor on Friday. The U.K.'s update said the mayor of Dniprorudne is also thought to have been abducted by Russian forces.  ""Russia is likely to make further attempts to subvert Ukrainian democracy as it attempts to consolidate political control of Ukraine,"" the British Ministry of Defense said.  — Chloe Taylor  Mayor of Kyiv Vitaliy Klitschko has said shells hit several residential buildings in the Ukrainian capital early this morning.  Two high-rise buildings in Kyiv's Sviatoshyno district, one high-rise building in the Podil district, and a private house were hit by Russian ammunition, he said in a Telegram post.    ""The entrance to one of the metro stations was damaged by the shock wave,"" Klitschko added, according to an NBC News translation. ""There are victims in residential buildings, the information is being clarified. Rescuers and medics are working on the ground.""  — Chloe Taylor  You can read Monday's live coverage here:   Russia-Ukraine talks done for the day; EU agrees to fresh sanctions "
Ukraine crisis: China wants to avoid U.S. sanctions over Russia's war,2022-03-15 18:33:32+00:00,"China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, says Beijing wants to avoid being impacted by U.S. sanctions over Russia's war with Ukraine.  ""China is not a party to the crisis, nor does it want the sanctions to affect China,"" Wang said Monday during a call with Spanish counterpart Jose Manuel Albares to discuss the crisis in Ukraine.  ""China has the right to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.""  His comments are seen as one of Beijing's most explicit statements yet on the unprecedented barrage of international sanctions imposed against Russia's corporate and financial system. The measures came in response to the Kremlin's full-scale offensive into Ukraine, which began Feb. 24.  The White House has warned China not to provide Russia with an economic lifeline as the Kremlin steps up its onslaught on Ukraine. The U.S. says it fears China, a key strategic ally of Moscow, may seek to cushion the impact of measures designed to destroy Russia's economy if the war continues.  There are concerns among market participants that Chinese companies could soon become embroiled in financial penalties after reports that Moscow had asked Beijing for assistance to support its Ukraine invasion.  China has denied these reports, while Russia has said it did not request military aid from Beijing.  Since Russia's attack on Ukraine, Beijing has refused to call it an invasion and said China would maintain normal trade with both countries. China has not joined the U.S., EU and other countries' sanctions on Russia.  China has said, however, that it is ""deeply"" worried about the crisis in Ukraine.  Officials from the U.S. and China met on Monday to discuss a range of bilateral issues, including Russia's war with Ukraine. The talks, which were held in Rome, spanned seven hours and were described as ""intense"" by one senior administration official.  The U.S. has warned of consequences for any country that provides Russia with support amid the Kremlin's conflict with Ukraine.  ""We are watching very closely to the extent to which the PRC [People's Republic of China] or any country in the world provides support material, economic, financial, rhetorical otherwise, to this war of choice that President [Vladimir] Putin is waging against the government of Ukraine, against the state of Ukraine and against the people of Ukraine,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a news briefing Monday.  ""We have been very clear both privately with Beijing and publicly with Beijing that there would be consequences for any such support,"" Price said.  Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Sunday that the Kremlin was counting on China to help it withstand the fallout from global economic measures imposed against Moscow, Reuters reported.  In speaking with Spain's Albares, China's Wang reaffirmed Beijing's long-held stance of objecting to unilateral sanctions outside of the United Nations.  ""China always opposes the use of sanctions to solve problems, and even more opposes unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law, which will undermine international rules and bring harm to the people's livelihood of all countries,"" Wang said.  — CNBC's Amanda Macias and Weizhen Tan contributed to this report.

"Dow jumps nearly 600 points, S&P 500 snaps 3-day losing streak as tech stocks bounce, oil prices slide",2022-03-16 00:22:53+00:00,"The S&P 500 rose on Tuesday for its first gain in four days, as oil prices continued to drop further below $100 and a reading of wholesale inflation came in lighter than expected.  The gains came as traders continued to eye the latest with ceasefire negotiations in Ukraine and China Covid lockdowns that could wreak havoc on tech supply chains. Investors are anticipating a big Federal Reserve monetary decision Wednesday, in which the central bank is expected to hike rates for the first time since 2018.  The broad market index rose 2.1% to 4,262.45, though it remains more than 11% from its record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 599.10 points, or 1.8%, to 33,544.34. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 2.9% to 12,948.62.  CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said a volatile and confusing market that has fatigued investors was due for a relief rally, even if it's just that.  ""Because this market has been so weak, so unconvincing since its all-time high on January 3, and because of intraday reversals, no one really knows what will end up being,"" Stovall said. ""But what is causing the market to be totally in the green today is it's just getting tired of going straight down for such an extended period. So even if this were simply a relief rally, I think we are due for one.""  Falling oil prices and inflation data are both catalysts for that rally, Stovall added. Additionally, with investors looking forward to the outcome of the Fed's meeting, Stovall noted that the market remembers stocks tend to rise in the first, third and twelfth months after an initial rate increase.  ""The market expects seven [rate] hikes in 2022. Given the sell-off in the commodity markets, there's a little less fear of inflation, and when that's the case, the natural inclination is to go toward the growthier sectors,"" Julian Emanuel, Evercore ISI senior managing director of equity, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Tuesday.  Tech stocks led the bounce after recent losses. Microsoft and Netflix each rose 3.8% after Wall Street analysts reiterated their overweight ratings. Oracle climbed 4.5%. Chipmakers climbed, with Nvidia 7.7% higher and Advanced Micro Devices up 6.9%.  Disney and McDonald's added 4% and 2.8%, respectively. Peloton jumped 11.9% after Bernstein initiated coverage of it with an outperform rating and said recent losses make this an ""absurdly attractive"" entry point for investors.

United and American each rose more than 9%, while Delta added 8.7%.  Falling oil prices pushed up other travel stocks as well, including cruise lines, hotels, casino and gaming companies and travel booking site operators, which were among the top gainers in the S&P 500. The Invesco Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment ETF gained about 2.7%.  Meanwhile, the drop in oil prices put pressure on energy stocks. Chevron and Exxon each fell about 5%. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund was down about 3.7%, for its third straight negative day and its worst day since November.  Oil prices continued their decline Tuesday. U.S. crude futures slid about 6.4% to settle at $96.44 per barrel, after topping $130 about a week ago. Meanwhile, the international Brent benchmark settled 6.5% lower at $99.91 per barrel.  February's surge in energy prices led wholesale goods prices to their biggest one-month jump on record, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. The headline producer price index (PPI) rose 0.8% in February from the previous month. While that was slightly lower than the 0.9% estimated by Dow Jones, it still showed a 10% gain from the same time last year.  However, core PPI, which excludes food, energy and trade services, rose just 0.2%. That was below the expectation of 0.6%.  In Ukraine, the capital city of Kyiv announced a 35-hour curfew that begins at 8 p.m. local time following Russian missile strikes that hit several residential buildings in the city. Russia and Ukraine resumed talks Tuesday, following a fourth round of negotiations Monday. Meanwhile, Russia is approaching a series of deadlines to make payments on its debt.  On Monday, United States officials held ""intense"" talks with China to discuss, among other things, concerns that Beijing may attempt to help Russia blunt global sanctions. The discussion followed reports that Moscow requested military equipment from China for its war in Ukraine.  China is also facing its worst Covid outbreak since the height of the pandemic. Shenzhen, a major city in a key manufacturing hub in China, has shut down nonessential businesses and imposed city-wide testing, raising concern over the global economic recovery going forward.  The Federal Reserve kicked off an important two-day meeting Tuesday, with investors expecting a quarter-point rate hike to be announced Wednesday. That would be just the beginning of the central bank's unwinding of the massive economic aid it provided during the pandemic.  Rising inflation is expected to be the focal point of the meeting, however. At the last update, in December, officials projected inflation would run at 2.7%. However, February's core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's primary inflation gauge, indicated inflation is up 5.2% from a year ago.  Policymakers will also update their outlook for rates as well as GDP, inflation and unemployment. "

Intel commits $36 billion to making chips in Europe,2022-03-16 08:34:04+00:00,"Intel announced Tuesday that it plans to invest over 33 billion euros ($36 billion) into boosting chipmaking across the European Union as the bloc looks to become more self-reliant when it comes to semiconductors.  The Santa Clara-based chipmaker said it will build two new factories in Madgeburg, Germany, as part of the investment. The factories will use the most advanced chip manufacturing technology as part of an effort to produce chips that are two nanometers or less in width.  Construction is set to begin in the first half of 2023 and production will come online in 2027, providing there are no regulatory issues, Intel said.  The firm said Germany is an ideal place to establish the new ""Silicon Junction"" mega-site because of the talent and infrastructure on offer, as well as the existing ecosystem of suppliers and customers.  Some 17 billion euros will be invested in the German facilities, Intel said, adding that it expects the investment to create 7,000 construction jobs over the course of the build and 3,000 permanent jobs at Intel.  Olaf Scholz, chancellor of Germany, said in a statement that the fabs will help rebalance global silicon capacity and create a more resilient supply chain. They will be backed with billions of euros in state aid, according to a report from The Financial Times.  Intel also pledged to create a new R&D and design hub in France, and to invest in R&D, manufacturing and foundry services in Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain.  Approximately 12 billion euros is expected to be invested in doubling the manufacturing space of a facility in Leixlip, Ireland, where less cutting-edge technology is used. Intel said it will have spent over 30 billion euros in Ireland when the expansion is complete.  In Italy, Intel said it is ""in negotiations"" about a new 4.5 billion euro ""back-end"" manufacturing facility.  There has been a shortage of some types of semiconductors for around two years after the Covid-19 pandemic put a strain on supply chains as demand for electronics surged.  Europe is in the midst of trying to reduce its reliance on Asia and the U.S. for semiconductors but setting up chip foundries costs billions of dollars.  Intel, one of three chipmaking heavyweights along with TSMC and Samsung, said the investments are part of a broader package that will see the company invest as much as 80 billion euros in Europe over the next decade.  The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, announced a new European Chips Act last month that will enable 15 billion euros in additional public and private investments until 2030. This is on top of 30 billion euros of public investments that had previously been earmarked.  ""The EU Chips Act will empower private companies and governments to work together to drastically advance Europe's position in the semiconductor sector,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a statement.  ""This broad initiative will boost Europe's R&D innovation and bring leading-edge manufacturing to the region for the benefit of our customers and partners around the world. We are committed to playing an essential role in shaping Europe's digital future for decades to come.""  Alan Priestley, an analyst at research firm at Gartner, told CNBC last year that it's a ""really big ask"" for Europe to build an indigenous chip manufacturer on the same scale as Intel, Samsung or TSMC.  He added that it's ""probably not viable"" because the investment required to manufacture bleeding-edge chips is enormous.  ""You can't suddenly go in and say, 'I'm going to set up a five nanometer manufacturing capacity,'"" Priestley said. ""You've almost got to have had the previous generations, or several generations prior to that, and work your way up to five nanometer.""  Intel is also investing billions in its home country. The company announced last March that it plans to spend $20 billion on two new fabs in Arizona.  TSMC is also setting up a new chip plant in Arizona as part of a broader $100 billion investment that it plans to make over the next three years. "
Is omicron subvariant BA.2 to blame for rising Covid cases?,2022-03-18 00:15:08+00:00,"LONDON — Covid cases are rising in Europe, with an increasing number being attributed to the prevalence of a ""stealth"" subvariant of the omicron strain.  Covid cases have increased dramatically in the U.K. in recent weeks, while Germany continues to mark record high daily infections with more than 250,000 new cases a day. Elsewhere, France, Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands are also seeing Covid infections start to rise again, aided and abetted by the relaxation of coronavirus measures and the spread of a new subvariant of omicron, known as BA.2.  Public health officials and scientists are closely monitoring BA.2, which has been described as a ""stealth"" variant because it has genetic mutations that could make it harder to distinguish from the delta variant using PCR tests, compared with the original omicron variant, BA.1.  The new subvariant would be the latest in a long line to emerge since the pandemic began in China in late 2019. The omicron variant — the most transmissible strain so far — overtook the delta variant, which itself supplanted the alpha variant — and even this was not the original strain of the virus.  Now, Danish scientists believe that the BA.2 subvariant is 1½ times more transmissible than the original omicron strain, and is already overtaking it. The BA.2 variant is now responsible for over half of the new cases in Germany and makes up around 11% of cases in the U.S.  That number is expected to rise further, as it has in Europe.  ""It's clear that BA.2 is more transmissible than BA.1 and this, combined with the relaxation of mitigation measures and waning immunity, is contributing to the current surge in infections,"" Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Warwick University, told CNBC on Monday.  ""The increased infectiousness of BA.2 is already out-competing and replacing BA.1, and we are likely to see similar waves of infection as other variants enter the population.""  As long as the virus continues to spread and replicate, particularly in populations which are undervaccinated or where vaccine-induced immunity is decaying, ""it will throw up new variants and these will remain a continual threat even to those countries with high rates of vaccination,"" Young noted. ""Living safely with Covid doesn't mean ignoring the virus and hoping it will go away forever.""  The BA.2 variant is being closely monitored by the World Health Organization and similar public health bodies on a national level, including the U.K. Health Security Agency which has said the subvariant is ""under investigation"" but is not yet of concern.  Still, the WHO acknowledged in a statement last month that ""the proportion of reported sequences designated BA.2 has been increasing relative to BA.1 in recent weeks.""  Initial data show that BA.2 is a little more likely to cause infections in household contacts, when compared with BA.1. It's not believed currently that the BA.2 variant causes more severe illness or carries an increased the risk of being hospitalized, however further research is needed to confirm this, according to a U.K. parliamentary report published last week.  Hospitalizations have also risen in a number of European countries as Covid infections have increased in recent weeks, but deaths remain far lower than in previous peaks thanks to widespread vaccine coverage.  The UKHSA has done a preliminary analysis comparing vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease for BA.1 and BA.2 infections and found that the levels of protection are similar, with efficacy of up to 77% soon after a booster shot, although this wanes over time.  The WHO has also noted that BA.2 differs from BA.1 in its genetic sequence, including some amino acid differences in the spike protein and other proteins which could give it an advantage over the original omicron.  ""Studies are ongoing to understand the reasons for this growth advantage, but initial data suggest that BA.2 appears inherently more transmissible than BA.1, which currently remains the most common omicron sublineage reported. This difference in transmissibility appears to be much smaller than, for example, the difference between BA.1 and Delta,"" the organization said last month.  The WHO added that initial studies suggest that anyone who has been infected with the original omicron variant has strong protection against reinfection with its subvariant BA.2.  Dr. Andrew Freedman, an academic covering infectious disease at Cardiff Medical School, told CNBC he doesn't think we need to be too concerned about BA.2, despite the fact that it is slightly more contagious.  ""I suspect the rising number of cases is related to several factors including BA.2, the relaxation of restrictions and more social mixing, less mask wearing and some waning of immunity from both previous infections and vaccination, especially in those who received boosters early on,"" he said.  ""There has been an upturn in hospital admissions testing positive for Covid in the U.K., but many of these are incidental and there has not been a parallel increase in deaths.""  The U.K., and the rest of Europe, have acted as a bellwether for the U.S. at several points in the pandemic, declared two years ago by the WHO. particularly when it comes to the rise and spread of new Covid variants which have emerged and subsequently supplanted previous strains of the virus.  This makes the emergence and growing prevalence of the BA.2 variant a point of concern for the U.S. where cases have nose-dived recently to reassuring lows.  Already some parts of the U.S. are seeing an increasing number of infections linked to BA.2, particularly in New York, according to data collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Elsewhere, China is currently facing its worst Covid-19 outbreak since the height of the pandemic in 2020.  Read CNBC's latest global coverage of the Covid pandemic:  It's unclear whether BA.2 is contributing to the latest wave of cases, although a prominent infectious disease expert in China told news outlet Caixin that much of the current outbreak is being driven by the BA.2 subvariant.  U.K. data certainly illustrates BA.2's increasingly prevalence. Sequenced data from Feb. 27 to March 6 found that 68.6% of cases were omicron lineage BA.2, with just 31.1% omicron BA.1. "
Oil: Shell directors sued for failing to prepare for energy transition,2022-03-15 14:14:36+00:00,"Shell's board is being sued for failing to prepare the multinational oil and gas company for the transition away from fossil fuels.  Environmental law firm ClientEarth, a Shell shareholder, said Tuesday that it had notified Shell of its claim against the company's 13 executive and non-executive directors. It argues the board's failure to implement a climate strategy that truly aligns with the landmark Paris Agreement is a breach of their duties under English law.  The case is thought to mark the first-ever attempt at holding a company's board of directors personally liable ""for failing to properly prepare for the net zero transition.""  ""Shell is seriously exposed to the physical and transitional risks of climate change, yet its climate plan is fundamentally flawed,"" Paul Benson, a ClientEarth lawyer, said in a statement.  ""The longer the Board delays, the more likely it is that the company will have to execute an abrupt 'handbrake turn' to retain commercial competitiveness and meet the challenges of inevitable regulatory developments,"" Benson said.  The not-for-profit group, which has a strong track record of winning climate-related cases, says it has notified Shell and will await the firm's response before formally filing papers in the High Court of England and Wales for permission to bring the claim.  If the legal case is ultimately successful, the court could force Shell's board to align its climate strategy with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. It could also declare that Shell's board is in breach of its legal duties. If the claimants lose, however, they could be liable for the full costs of the case.  In response to the legal action, Shell told CNBC via email that it was delivering on its global strategy that supported the Paris accord. This includes plans to transform its business ""to provide more low-carbon energy for customers,"" the company added.  The Paris Agreement aims to pursue efforts to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by slashing greenhouse gas emissions.  To be sure, it is the burning of fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, that is the chief driver of the climate emergency.  ""Addressing a challenge as big as climate change requires action from all quarters. The energy supply challenges we are seeing underscore the need for effective, government-led, policies to address critical needs such as energy security while decarbonising our energy system,"" a spokesperson for Shell said. ""These challenges cannot be solved by litigation.""  Shares of Shell dipped 0.8% during early afternoon trade in London. The firm's stock price is up more than 17% year-to-date.  ClientEarth says it is acting in the best long-term interests of Shell by pursuing shareholder litigation. It claims the Shell board's mismanagement of climate risk puts its directors in breach of their duties under the U.K. Companies Act. This law stipulates directors are legally required to promote the firm's success and to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence.  ClientEarth has called on other shareholders to join the legal action, saying many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders have expressed concern about the firm's climate strategy.  At the firm's annual general meeting last year, more than 30% of shareholders voted against the board in support of a resolution calling for Paris-aligned emissions targets.  Shell has faced legal action over its climate strategy before.  In May 2021, a Dutch court ordered the oil giant to reduce its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030, compared with 2019 levels. It also said Shell is responsible for its own carbon emissions and those of its suppliers, known as Scope 3 emissions.  Shell is appealing the ruling.  The legal case comes at a time when Russia's onslaught on Ukraine has triggered the biggest energy market shock in decades, with oil prices soaring to multi-year highs as international allies imposed a barrage of sanctions on Russia's corporate and financial system.  Last month, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden described 2021 as a ""momentous year"" for the company after rebounding commodity prices resulted in a sharp upswing in profit. "
Tech analyst explains why he is bullish on chip makers right now,2022-03-15 03:07:00+00:00,
VW and Goldman Sachs-backed Northvolt plans German gigafactory,2022-03-15 12:59:58+00:00,"Northvolt said Tuesday it would look to build a gigafactory in Germany, with the firm hoping the facility's first batteries will be produced in 2025.  In a statement, the Stockholm-headquartered battery maker said the Northvolt Drei plant would be located in Heide, northern Germany, and provide lithium-ion batteries for the European market.  Northvolt said the plant's ""potential production capacity"" was slated to be 60 gigawatt hours per year, which would be ""sufficient for some one million electric vehicles.""  The firm said Northvolt Drei — ""drei"" is three in German — would be its third gigafactory. Gigafactories are facilities that produce batteries for electric vehicles on a large scale. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been widely credited as coining the term.  Northvolt said the location of the factory in the state of Schleswig-Holstein would enable it to tap into the area's energy grid.  It described the grid as being ""characterized by a surplus of electricity generated by onshore and offshore wind power and reinforced by clean energy provided through grid interconnections to Denmark and Norway.""  Northvolt was founded in 2016 and has attracted investment from Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen, among others.  ""It matters how we produce a battery cell,"" Peter Carlsson, Northvolt's CEO, said Tuesday. ""If you use coal in your production, you embed a fair amount of CO2 into your battery, but if we use clean energy, we can build a very sustainable product,"" Carlsson said.  ""Our philosophy is that new energy-intensive industries, such as battery manufacturing, should be established in actual geographical proximity to where the clean energy is produced.""  Wall Street banks pick their top semiconductor stocks as electric vehicle production soars  Forget Tesla — this auto stock is the one to buy right now, analyst says  Europe's moving away from Russian energy — and that could boost EV charging stocks  Northvolt is not alone in looking to establish a gigafactory in Germany, an industrial and economic powerhouse that's home to a highly skilled labor force. Tesla is working on its Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, for example.  Elsewhere, VW — which in Dec. 2021 said it had a stake of roughly 20% in Northvolt — wants to develop a number of its own gigafactories in Europe, including one in the German state of Lower Saxony.  Further afield, on Monday Ford said it had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with South Korea's SK On Co. and Turkey's Koç Holding.  The MOU relates to the establishment of a joint venture centered around the development of a commercial EV battery facility near the Turkish capital of Ankara. If all goes to plan, it's hoped production at the plant could begin by the middle of this decade.  Ford said the JV had support from the Turkish government and would have a capacity ranging between 30 to 45 gigawatt hours per year.  Efforts to establish facilities focused on EV batteries come at a time when major economies are looking to reduce the environmental footprint of road-based transportation and move away from vehicles based on gasoline and diesel.  The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is targeting a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions from cars and vans by 2035. Turkey, where the Ford-backed battery facility would be located, is not part of the EU.  The U.K., which left the EU at the end of January 2020, wants to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. It will require, from 2035, all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions. "
"Apple iPhone SE 2022 review: Speed, 5G, only $429, but old look",2022-03-14 22:45:21+00:00,"Apple's new $429 iPhone SE launches Friday.  I've been testing it for the past several days, and it's a good option for people who just need an iPhone without all the fancy stuff you'll pay for on the iPhone 13, such as a nicer screen and better cameras.  The iPhone SE is $30 more than the identically named model that launched in 2020 for $399. It offers more than that model, including support for faster 5G cellular, stronger glass, and the same high-speed processor that appears in the more expensive iPhone 13 (which starts at $699 for the Mini model). But it seems inflation and supply chain constraints could also be playing a role. I think Apple could really have boosted the appeal by dropping the price a bit, considering consumers are getting squeezed everywhere else right now, from the grocery store to the gas pump.  The iPhone SE isn't as popular as Apple's other phones. According to Counterpoint Research, the 2020 version of the iPhone SE accounted for 12% of all iPhone sales from its launch until Q4 2021. The addition of 5G, however, could make it a compelling option in international markets such as Europe and China where Apple didn't yet have a low-priced 5G phone to compete with budget Android devices.   Here's what you need to know about it.  Apple's strategy for the iPhone SE is to take the same body and screen from older phone models to save on costs, while adding in the latest processor and cellular chip to keep it up to date. That means it can still run all the latest games and apps that you'd expect from any new iPhone — I played Disney's Melee Mania, for example — without any slowdown that you might otherwise see in a phone that's a few years old.  It's got the same body design as the iPhone 8 from 2017, which looks a bit out of date but also means it's the only iPhone you can still buy with a fingerprint-reading home button instead of Apple's Face ID unlock system, which is only now getting support for face masks.  I love the size. I normally carry Apple's much bigger iPhone 13 Pro Max, which feels a bit like a brick next to the iPhone SE. I'd turn to the iPhone SE to toss in my pocket for a run, and it was a lot easier to use to watch movies with one hand  while lying down without worrying about it dropping on my face. The stereo speakers are good, too. But if you have the budget, the iPhone 13 Mini is the same size with a way better screen, slightly longer battery life, and nicer cameras.   The 5G works well, too. It doesn't support some of the fastest mmWave networks that other iPhone and Android devices can, but those networks aren't widely available anyway. More importantly, it does support the new C-band networks that are being rolled out by Verizon and AT&T, as well as T-Mobile's solid nationwide 5G network. So, while 5G still isn't a must-have for most people, it's great if you need to download a big playlist or a couple of TV shows before you hop on a flight. In my tests, T-Mobile's 5G network hit about 300Mbps at home, which was faster than my Wi-Fi in parts of my house.   The camera is good but it's definitely one area where you can feel the cost savings. It's got the same lens as the 2020 model but still takes slightly better pictures thanks to the image signal processor that comes with the latest A15 chip. Portrait shots, which nicely blur the background of your subject, can be taken of people, but it doesn't detect pets for those images. There's no night mode, which means shots taken in the dark aren't as clear as they are on Apple's more expensive phones. But it took nice, clean shots and did a good job capturing the deep reds of some tulips. The front-facing camera is solid for selfies with nice color and tone balance.  Finally, while it's not as water-resistant as Apple's other iPhones, it can still survive a dunk in the bath or a spill without any worry, and has the same strong glass as other iPhones to help prevent shattering if you drop it. It doesn't feel cheap like some low-cost Android phones, which often use plastic instead of glass and metal.   The iPhone SE isn't really made for power users, and that shows in the battery life. It'll get you through a day if you're making phone calls and surfing the web, but don't expect it to last all day if you're doing a ton of gaming or more processor-intensive tasks.   It looks the same as the iPhone SE from 2020, which looked the same as the iPhone 8 from 2017. It does look dated, and there are lots of phones with nicer screens that reach the top and bottom of the phone.   The screen is adequate, but won't wow you like the brighter and faster screens on Apple's more expensive phones.  I like that it supports wireless charging if you have a Qi charging pad around the house, but it doesn't support Apple's newer MagSafe pucks, which magnetically attach to the back of the phone and charge even faster wirelessly.   Finally, while most people looking for a budget phone are probably fine with 64GB of storage, I recommend spending $479 for the model with 128GB if you plan to download and save more apps, movies and games.   People always ask me what iPhone they should buy. My response is usually to ask another question: What do you want to do with it?  If you just need an iPhone that can run every app and the latest software, then the iPhone SE is a great buy for the price. It's a huge upgrade for folks coming from similar devices, like the old iPhone 8. It's also a great first phone for teens — these days, a lot of kids get their first phone when they're in middle school.  But if you have a bigger budget, I still think the best phones for most people are the $799 iPhone 13, or the smaller $699 iPhone 13 Mini if you like that size. You can unlock those phones with your face, they have nicer screens, they take better pictures, and they have better battery life.  If you want to go all-out with the smoothest, brightest screen and nicer stainless steel materials, then the iPhone 13 Pro models are your best bet.   Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.  "
Tesla has bought aluminum from Russian supplier Rusal since 2020,2022-03-14 22:24:33+00:00,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk won global praise for assisting Ukraine as Russia began its brutal invasion. His aerospace company switched on its satellite internet service, Starlink, for use in Ukraine at the request of the country's digital transformation minister, Mykhailo Fedorov. His electric car company pitched in too, assembling Starlink equipment and Powerwalls, energy storage systems that can power that equipment, to ship to Ukraine.  But Tesla also has supply chain ties to Russia. Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker has purchased millions of euros worth of aluminum from Rusal, a company founded by sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, according to internal documents obtained by CNBC.  Rusal was once sanctioned by the US Treasury, which cited Russia's ""malign activities"" at the time, but those sanctions were lifted under former President Donald Trump in 2019. Tesla only began buying aluminum from the company in late 2020.  Tesla purchases Rusal aluminum for casting parts at its new vehicle assembly plant outside of Berlin, according to invoices, internal correspondence, and several current and former employees who spoke with CNBC on condition of anonymity, citing fear of retaliation.  The aluminum can be used, among other things, for casting and to make body shells for the Tesla Model Y, and has been used in production on new manufacturing lines at the Tesla plant in Brandenburg, Germany. That plant is not fully up and running yet, but recently gained conditional approval to start commercial production soon. There's no indication that Rusal aluminum has been used in US production.  Tesla's willingness to work with at least one Russian supplier is not unusual — ten of the world's largest automakers buy from at least one tier-1 supplier in Russia, according to Interos, a global supply chain and risk management research firm based in Arlington, Virginia.  But Moscow's aggression against Ukraine has thrown supplier relationships into question, and forced businesses to ask whether they can legally and morally keep paying millions to corporations that enrich the Russian federation and the Putin confidants who lead those businesses. Inflation may play into these decisions — Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged on Sunday evening that the company is facing significant inflationary pressure in the cost of raw materials.  CNBC has not learned precisely how much Tesla has paid Rusal for metals to-date. CNBC asked Tesla if the company is taking steps to sever business relationships with Rusal or any other Russian companies, but Tesla did not reply.  Rusal, the second-largest aluminum supplier in the world, was once among the largest companies that the US ever put on its sanctions list. Earlier curbs were lifted in January 2019 after the company's billionaire founder, Oleg Deripaska, agreed to relinquish control and Rusal's parent company, EN+ Group International, appointed new directors to its board to satiate U.S. Treasury demands for independent directors.  Deripaska went on to sue the US Treasury Department and its Office of Foreign Assets Control to attempt to reverse the sanctions that personally affected his wealth and reputation. A judge dismissed the case, however Deripaska has an appeal pending.  Since Russia's 2022 siege on Ukraine began, Rusal has not been sanctioned again by the US, and Deripaska's standing with Putin is unknown. The billionaire has called for peace, and Reuters reported that he said on March 7, ""The whole world will be different after these events and Russia will be different.""  Rusal's controlling shareholder, EN+ Group International, is reportedly considering a transfer of the company's international assets to a new entity, which would have no Russian owners, management, or control.  Rusal declined to comment.  Rusal is not Tesla's sole or primary aluminum supplier. Tesla has worked for years with metals giant Hydro as a more significant supplier of aluminum, for example. According to Hydro's website, the company's aluminum metal production facilities are based throughout Europe, Canada, Australia, Brazil and Qatar. ""Two-thirds of our primary aluminum production is based on renewable energy,"" the company boasts.  But Musk's car company has spent millions of Euros with Rusal since the end of 2020, according to invoices and other documents viewed by CNBC. A German subsidiary of Tesla has historically paid the Swiss subsidiary of Rusal through an Austrian bank.  Tesla's purchases of aluminum from Rusal began after a changing of the guard in the company's executive ranks and after Elon Musk announced in November 2019 that Tesla would build a factory in Germany, according to records and internal correspondence, and current and former employees familiar with the matter.  One former employee with direct knowledge said Tesla's previous CFO, Deepak Ahuja, was ""allergic"" to doing business in or with Russia due to the the rise and impacts of Russian organized crime in the country, and risks of sanctions on any suppliers or partners in Russia following Moscow's invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014.  After Ahuja announced his resignation in January 2019, with Zachary Kirkhorn taking over as CFO in March that year, Tesla worked with a consulting firm called Global Counsel Limited to analyze the business environment, market potential and risks of working in Russia, according to this former employee and internal records viewed by CNBC.  While Tesla decided to hold off on opening factories, sales, or service centers in Russia indefinitely, the company was aware that some of its vehicles had been imported to Russia independently. As such, the company has created and maintains some vehicle service manuals and other road safety documents pertaining to use of its cars in Russia.  By December 2020, Tesla decided to start sourcing some aluminum from Rusal for casting at its new plant being built in Germany and was doing so through February 2022.  According to Interos, which monitors global supply chains using machine learning software, ten of the world's largest automakers all have at least one direct supplier in Russia, and 27 companies based in Russia directly supply these car companies. Four of the largest domestic automakers have direct, or tier 1, relationships with 13 different Russian suppliers.  Interos CEO and founder Jennifer Bisceglie said, ""The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is literally an invasion of the global supply chain by Russia. In response, we are literally cutting parts of our developed supply chain off through sanctions and war. Companies are responding by doing two things-- one is stockpiling, buying as much as they can as rapidly as they can. Beyond that, they are looking for alternative sources whether that's from another place or from another metal or material that they can use as a substitute.""  Kristine Pirnia, who leads the export controls and sanctions practice at the law firm Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, also spoke with CNBC about autos industry disruption from the nascent war on Ukraine generally.  Pirnia noted that even if it remains legal, and ethically justifiable, for automakers to work with Russian suppliers, banking focused sanctions and the complexity of legal compliance could make it nearly impossible to keep doing so.  ""The US has been very thoughtful and strategic in respect to sanctions It has issued to-date."" Pirnia said, ""There's not a blanket rule. That means you have to do multiple steps of analysis on every transaction relating to Russia.""  While automakers are working to understand what their businesses must change to remain compliant with new sanctions as they roll out, Pirnia explained, the industry is most concerned that it may be impossible to conduct financial transactions with these Russian businesses, due to the strong focus on banking in sanctions by Western governments.  Last week on Friday, President Joe Biden urged Congress to join the European Union in suspending normal trade relations with Russia, which would put Russia on the same tier as Cuba or North Korea and could make Russian metals prohibitively expensive long-term for US companies like Tesla.

Volunteers sign up to help in cyberwars between Russia and Ukraine  ,2022-03-14 05:59:48+00:00,"Cyber warfare related to the Ukraine-Russia conflict is surging as digital volunteers from around the world enter the fight.  The number of cyberattacks being waged by — and on behalf of — both countries since the outbreak of the war is ""staggering,"" according to the research arm of Check Point Software Technologies.  ""For the first time in history anyone can join a war,"" said Lotem Finkelstein, head of threat intelligence at Check Point Software. ""We're seeing the entire cyber community involved, where many groups and individuals have taken a side, either Russia or Ukraine.""  ""It's a lot of cyber chaos,"" he said.  In the first three days following the invasion, online attacks against Ukrainian military and governmental sectors increased by 196%, according to Check Point Research (CPR). They also modestly increased against Russian (4%) and Ukrainian (0.2%) organizations, according to the data, while simultaneously falling in most other parts of the world.  Since then, Ukrainian authorities estimate some 400,000 multinational hackers have volunteered to help Ukraine, said Yuval Wollman, president of cyber security company CyberProof and the former director-general of the Israeli Intelligence Ministry.  ""Grassroots volunteers created widespread disruption — graffitiing anti-war messages on Russian media outlets and leaking data from rival hacking operations,"" he said. ""Never have we seen this level of involvement by outside actors unrelated to the conflict.""  Three weeks in, Ukraine continues to sustain a barrage of online attacks, with most aimed at its government and military, according to CPR's data.  Moscow has consistently denied that it engages in cyberwarfare or assists cyberattacks. On Feb. 19, the Russian embassy in Washington said on Twitter that it ""has never conducted and does not conduct any 'malicious' operations in cyberspace.""  CPR data shows attacks on Russia decreased over the same timeframe, said Finkelstein. There may be several reasons for that, he said, including Russian efforts to reduce the visibility of attacks or increased security to defend against them.  As a long-time target of suspected Russian cyberattacks, Ukraine is seemingly welcoming the digital help.  Following a request posted on Twitter by Ukraine's digital minister Mykhailo Fedorov, some 308,000 people joined a Telegram group known as the ""IT Army of Ukraine.""    One member of the group is Gennady Galanter, co-founder of information technology company Provectus. He said the group is focused on disrupting Russian websites, preventing disinformation and getting accurate information to Russian citizens.  ""It's working,"" he said, clarifying that he's acting in his own capacity, and not for his company.    Still, Galanter said he has mixed feelings about participating. One tactic employed by the group is distributed denial of service attacks, which try to make targeted websites inaccessible by overwhelming them with online traffic.  ""It's hooliganism,"" he said, yet at the same time Galanter, who fled the Soviet Union in 1991 and whose wife is Russian, said he feels compelled to help do his part to ""deliver truth and deny lies.""   He's donated money, he said, but now, he added, ""I'm doing this because I don't know what else to do.""  Galanter said he's concerned current efforts may be insufficient against Russia's cyber capabilities. He also said he's worried the group's efforts may be dismissed as Ukrainian or Western propaganda or labeled a disinformation machine of the very type he says he's fighting against.  ""The reality is that a lot of my friends in Russia, my relatives … they're completely misinformed,"" he said. ""They have a deeply inaccurate view of what's going on — they just put to doubt what we say.""  Galanter said his company shut down its operations in Russia and helped to relocate employees who wanted to leave. He said the company told employees: ""The world has become pretty white and black. Those of you who share our perception of reality, you're welcome to join us.""  ""Just like these people are now, I was a refugee,"" he said. ""What [Putin] wants to create is exactly what I escaped.""  It's widely expected that Moscow and its supporters will retaliate against countries that side with Ukraine, and potentially the growing list of banks and businesses that are withdrawing from the country.  Elon Musk tweeted on March 4 that the decision to redirect Starlink satellites and deliver internet terminals to Ukraine meant that the ""probability of being targeted is high.""  Experts warn reciprocal retaliation could lead to a ""global cyberwar"" between Russia and the West.  Russia is widely believed to be behind several digital attacks against Ukraine in the weeks prior to the invasion, but since then Russia has shown restraint, ""at least for now,"" according to Wollman.  Still, reports of growing anger inside the Kremlin over new sanctions, compounded by Russia's military failures in Ukraine, may make cyber warfare one of few remaining ""tools"" in Putin's playbook, he said.  ""What tools does the Kremlin have against sanctions? They don't have economic tools,"" said Wollman. ""According to some, a cyber response would be the likeliest Russian countermeasure.""  The Ukraine-Russia war could inflame other long-standing territorial conflicts as well. Two Taiwanese tech startups, AutoPolitic and QSearch, announced last week they are providing free technology assistance to Ukraine and to ""Ukrainian online activists around the globe"" to counter Russian propaganda on social media.  ""Being a Taiwanese who lived under constant propaganda and threats of invasion from our cousin-neighbor, I feel a special bond with Ukrainians and acidic anger at their invaders,"" said AutoPolitic founder Roger Do, via a press release.

"Tesla hikes car prices in the U.S., China after Musk inflation warning",2022-03-15 18:28:28+00:00,"Tesla has hiked the prices of its electric vehicles in the U.S. and China after CEO Elon Musk warned of inflation pressure on the business.  The company raised the prices of all its models in the U.S. In China, a version of the Model 3 and the Model Y saw price hikes. It is the second increase within the last week.  Tesla did not give a reason for the increases. The company was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.  But Musk said in a tweet earlier this week that Tesla and his space exploration company SpaceX have seen ""significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics.""  Materials such as nickel, a key component of electric vehicle batteries, are on the rise.  Meanwhile, a flare-up of Covid cases in China and lockdowns in some cities have added a further challenge to already-stretched supply chains. Critical components like semiconductors also remain in short supply.  On Tuesday, Tesla's China website listed the starting price of the Model 3 Performance at 367,900 yuan ($57,648). The South China Morning Post reported on Mar. 10 the price was 349,900 yuan after a previous increase that day.  The Model Y Long Range in China now costs 375,900 yuan — up from the previous price of 357,900 yuan. The Model Y Performance is currently priced at 417,900 yuan, up from 397,900 yuan previously. "

SoftBank's Arm to make job cuts after $40 billion Nvidia deal collapse,2022-03-15 11:14:37+00:00,"LONDON — British chip designer Arm is planning to cut up to 1,000 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, just weeks after its $40 billion deal with Nvidia collapsed.  Widely regarded as the jewel in the crown of the U.K. tech sector, Arm employs employs around 6,400 people worldwide and roughly half of those are in the U.K.  ""Like any business, Arm is continually reviewing its business plan to ensure the company has the right balance between opportunities and cost discipline,"" an Arm spokesperson told CNBC Tuesday.  ""Unfortunately, this process includes proposed redundancies across Arm's global workforce.""  They added: ""If the proposals go ahead, we anticipate that around 12-15% percent of people in Arm would be affected globally.""  While Arm is headquartered in Cambridge, England, the company has been owned by Japanese tech giant SoftBank, which paid around $32 billion for the firm in 2016.  SoftBank announced in Sept. 2020 that it planned to sell Arm to U.S. chip giant Nvidia for $40 billion but the deal was scrapped in February following a period of intense scrutiny from competition regulators in the U.S., EU, China, and the U.K.  Opponents had several gripes, but the main issue with the deal was around access to Arm's innovative chip designs.  Arm licenses its ""architecture"" to hundreds of companies around the world. Apple uses them in iPhones and iPads, Amazon uses them in Kindles, and car manufacturers use them in vehicles. If Nvidia stopped other companies using Arm's chip designs in their semiconductors then analysts said the implications could have been huge.  Critics of the deal also suggested that Nvidia may cut jobs at Arm once it took ownership of the company. However, Nvidia repeatedly stressed that it wanted to invest in Arm.  Former Arm CEO Simon Segars told The Telegraph last July that the company may need to cut jobs if the Nvidia deal was blocked.  SoftBank is now planning to take Arm public with the Nvidia deal off the table. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's CEO, said in February that the company will most likely be listed on New York's Nasdaq stock exchange.  However, pressure is mounting on SoftBank to dual-list the company.  Julian Rowe, general partner at tech investment firm Latitude, told CNBC that the U.K. government should be doing all it can to make sure homegrown successful tech businesses like Arm are not being sold too early and too cheaply to international acquirers, or choosing to take their valued listings overseas.  ""History will tell you that Nasdaq or NYSE might be a more natural home for a chip designer like Arm, but that underestimates the degree to which Arm is arguably the least known success story in U.K. tech and the special position it can occupy through a London listing,"" Rowe said.  ""It has the potential to become a standard bearer in the U.K. high growth tech scene.""   "
China Covid spike worsens: Dongguan factory center locks down,2022-03-15 08:43:32+00:00,"BEIJING — China's worst Covid-19 outbreak since the initial wave of the pandemic worsened Tuesday with a major factory city ordering production halts.  Recent outbreaks in 28 provinces have infected more than 15,000 people and stem primarily from the highly transmissible omicron variant, China's National Health Commission said Tuesday, according to state media. China has 31 province-level regions.  Although the northern province of Jilin accounts for most of the cases, the latest outbreak has hit major cities such as the financial center of Shanghai and technology manufacturing hub Shenzhen.  On Tuesday, Dongguan city in the southern province of Guangdong ordered employees of businesses to work from home and locked down residential areas, permitting only necessary activities such as buying groceries and taking virus tests.  The city took a targeted approach to production halts. In industrial parks that haven't reported cases, businesses can maintain basic production under stringent virus control measures. Factory workers often live in dormitories near their workplace.  In areas reporting local cases, businesses must stop production, the announcement said. The measures took effect at noon on March 15 and will last for about a week, until the end of day March 21.  Guangdong province produced about 24% of China's exports in 2020, according to the latest available official data accessed through Wind Information. The database showed that among cities its size, Dongguan was the fifth-largest contributor to China's GDP last year, with 1.09 trillion yuan ($170.31 billion) in output.  Dongguan reported nine confirmed Covid cases and 46 asymptomatic cases for Monday. The nearby tech hub of Shenzhen, also in Guangdong province, reported 60 new cases, including asymptomatic ones.  The total local case count for Monday in mainland China included 3,507 new confirmed Covid cases and 1,647 asymptomatic ones, mostly in the northern province of Jilin. That's more than double from a day earlier.  On Tuesday, China's bureau of statistics spokesperson downplayed the impact of the Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, after reporting better-than-expected data for January and February.  Economists have said China's zero-Covid policy — using travel restrictions and neighborhood lockdowns to control outbreaks — affects consumer spending more than manufacturing.  But the latest wave of cases surpasses the pockets of outbreaks China has dealt with since the height of the initial pandemic in early 2020.  Fast food chain Yum China reported that sales have been hurt by the outbreaks.  ""Our operations are significantly impacted by the latest outbreaks and the tighter public health measures which resulted in a further reduction of social activities, travelling and consumption,"" Yum China, which operates Pizza Hut and KFC in the country, announced Monday.  Read CNBC's latest global coverage of the Covid pandemic:  Same-store sales for the first two weeks of March fell by about 20% year-on-year and are ""still trending down,"" the company said. The number of its stores that are temporarily closed or are offering only takeaway and delivery has more than doubled, Yum China said. There were over 500 such stores in January but more than 1,100 as of Sunday.  Yum China's same-store sales plunged by about 40% to 50% from a year ago during the Lunar New Year holiday in 2020 when Covid first hit China.  “China is set to see a sharp slowdown in March, given it is dealing with the worst Covid outbreak since 2020,"" Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, said in a note Tuesday. ”At this moment, policymakers are clearly putting COVID-zero ahead of growth.” "
China's reputation is at stake if Beijing helps Russia in Ukraine war,2022-03-15 09:25:13+00:00,"China risks paying ""high reputational costs"" should it decide to assist Russia in its war against Ukraine, according to one political analyst.  Even if China wanted to bail out Russia — either financially or economically — its capacity to do so is very limited, said Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S.  ""Much of Russia's exposure, China's exposure to the international financial system remains in U.S. dollars — not in rubles and the Chinese currency RMB. They could make a slight difference at the margin, but [China] would pay a pretty high reputational costs for doing that,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Tuesday.  On Monday, U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan held an ""intense"" seven-hour meeting with China's top foreign policy advisor Yang Jiechi in Rome.  At the meeting, Sullivan conveyed to Chinese officials that the U.S. is concerned Beijing may attempt to help Russia blunt global sanctions. The trip came amid reports that Moscow asked China to help provide military equipment for its invasion on Ukraine, including surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, and drones.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Monday denied such reports of the Russian request and called them malicious ""disinformation.""  ""The top priority at the moment is for all parties to exercise restraint, cool the situation down instead of adding fuel to the fire, and work for diplomatic settlement rather than further escalate the situation,"" Zhao told a regular briefing in Beijing.  The U.S., together with Ukraine and the Western allies, have ""already won the information war"" against Russia, said Daly.  ""Valdimir Putin is … the bad guy in the eyes of the world,"" and Moscow is fast becoming a ""pariah state,"" he said. China needs to ""ask itself if that's the side that it wants to be on,"" Daly added.  ""China had declared on February 4th that it had stood with Russia. But Russia, Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, Iran — this isn't really the international club that most Chinese people aspire to be part of. And circumstances are pushing China further in that direction. So there's a reputational risk,"" he noted.  Given the lack of evidence at this point that China actually provided military aid to Russia, this issue will likely raise further questions, said Yun Sun, a senior fellow and co-director of the East Asia Program and director of the China Program at the Stimson Center.  ""There's very little information as to what we're actually talking about in terms of military assistance,"" she told CNBC on Tuesday. ""There's also the question as to whether Beijing actually provided those assistance or Beijing just expressed a willingness,"" to provide some kind of military support, she added.  Still, political observers believe China's move to provide any kind of military or economic assistance to Russia could be a gamechanger and lead to far-reaching geopolitical consequences.  Political risk consultancy Eurasia Group said Monday it ""still believes — with only moderate conviction — that China is unlikely to directly assist Russia's invasion to this degree, as it is attempting to project neutrality in the conflict.""  One key point to watch in the coming days is whether China fulfills Russia's request for help in its invasion of Ukraine, the analysts said in a note.   ""The most shocking development would be Chinese agreement to provide military hardware or even lethal weapons to Russia, which would amount to Beijing actively taking Moscow's side in the conflict for the first time,"" they said.  ""This development would soon elicit US and EU sanctions and would produce a long-term geopolitical fracture between China and the West, including pressures for more extensive economic decoupling.""

Dubai utilities giant DEWA to go public as IPO boom gets underway,2022-03-15 10:04:35+00:00,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Dubai's state water and power company DEWA will list on the Dubai Financial Market as soon as April, after announcing an ambitious share prospectus that could make it the largest public offering of its kind in the emirate.  DEWA, or the Dubai Water and Electricity Authority, plans to sell a 6.5% stake by offering 3.25 billion shares in its public offering. A price range is expected to be announced by March 24, and shares could list on the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) by April 12, according to its prospectus released Tuesday.   ""This is a historical moment for DEWA as the first government entity in Dubai to go public,"" DEWA Chief Executive Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer said in a statement.   DEWA, which is the exclusive provider of water, electricity and district cooling to Dubai's 3.5 million local and expatriate residents, has 13.4 gigawatts of installed electricity capacity and can produce 490 million imperial gallons of desalinated water each day. The utility had adjusted earnings of $3.3 billion last year, and plans to pay a minimum dividend of $1.69 billion over the next five years to future investors.   DEWA also expects continued growth in demand in Dubai for its water and electricity, ""as the population is expected to grow from around 3.5 million people today to 5.8 million people by 2040,"" Al Tayer added.   DEWA will not receive any proceeds from the offering as the Dubai government will remain the major shareholder and majority owner of the company. DEWA said it would use the public offering to ""explore the use of new and innovative storage technologies"" in renewable energy and target international expansion for its district cooling services to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other regional markets.  ""Growth is also expected to result from the various investments made by the Group in new technologies,"" the prospectus said, including its expansion in green hydrogen, energy storage, electric vehicle charging and smart water projects.  The decision to go public comes as Dubai seeks to revive interest in its capital markets, which have failed to thrive in recent years. Rival bourses in Abu Dhabi and neighboring Riyadh have seen large listings, rising trading volumes, increasing foreign ownership and growing retail investor participation through the Covid-19 recovery.  Dubai plans to list as many as 10 state-owned entities this year, with road toll system Salik and business park operator Tecom earmarked as possible next candidates. Businesses within Emirates Group, including dnata and loyalty program Skywards, as well as Dubai airport's Duty Free, have also been rumored among those being considered for public offer.   "
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index drops to lowest close since 2016,2022-03-15 08:33:24+00:00,"SINGAPORE — Shares in China lagged among Asia-Pacific markets on Tuesday, with the release of much better-than-expected Chinese economic data offering little respite.

Electric vehicle maker Nio, another dual-listed stock, fell 12.81% after its U.S. listed-shares plunged overnight on renewed delisting fears.  Sentiment on Chinese tech shares had taken a hit on Monday following a report that Tencent could face a record fine for violating anti-money laundering rules.  ""Prospects of a hefty record fine on Tencent on money laundering regulatory breaches sent ripples of fears that Beijing's opaque crackdown on the tech space may not quite all be in the rear-view mirror just yet,"" Mizuho Bank's Vishnu Varathan wrote in a Tuesday note.

U.S. holds 'intense' 7-hour talks with China amid war in Ukraine,2022-03-15 00:14:01+00:00,"WASHINGTON – Officials from the United States and China met on Monday to discuss a range of challenges facing their bilateral relationship, including Russia's war in Ukraine.  A senior administration official described the talks, which were held in Rome, as ""intense"" and spanning at least seven hours.  The official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity, said Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, conveyed to China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, that the U.S. is concerned Beijing may attempt to help Russia blunt global sanctions.  ""What I would say in general is that we do have deep concerns about China's alignment with Russia,"" the official said. ""The national security adviser was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions.""  Sullivan's trip comes on the heels of reports that Moscow requested that China provide military equipment for its war in Ukraine, which is now in its third week. The official played down the timing of the trip when pressed by reporters.  ""This meeting had been planned for some time,"" the official said, adding that schedules were coordinated last fall between U.S. and Chinese officials.  Beijing has denied reports that it was asked by Moscow for military equipment or any other assistance to support its Ukraine invasion. On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied allegations that Russia requested military aid from China.  ""We are watching very closely to the extent to which the PRC or any country in the world provides support material, economic, financial, rhetorical otherwise, to this war of choice that President Putin is waging against the government of Ukraine, against the state of Ukraine and against the people of Ukraine,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a separate press briefing on Monday, referencing the People's Republic of China.  ""We have been very clear both privately with Beijing and publicly with Beijing that there would be consequences for any such support,"" Price added.  ""If China does choose to materially support Russia in this war, there will likely be consequences for China in that regard,"" a senior U.S. defense official said on a call with reporters on Monday.  ""We have seen China basically give tacit approval to what Russia is doing by refusing to join sanctions, by blaming the West and the United States for the assistance we've given Ukraine, and by claiming they wanted to see a peaceful outcome but essentially doing nothing to achieve it,"" the official added.

Dr. Gottlieb: China 'very vulnerable' to omicron spread despite 'zero-Covid policy',2022-03-14 22:36:40+00:00,"Low levels of natural immunity are complicating China's efforts to limit spread during its recent surge in cases of the new Covid omicron BA.2 subvariant, Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Monday.  ""China has a population that's very vulnerable to this new variant. This is a much more contagious variant, it's going to be harder to control, and they don't have a population that has natural immunity,"" the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner said in an interview on ""Squawk Box.""  The BA.2 omicron subvariant, colloquially called ""stealth"" omicron, was first identified in late 2021.  ""They haven't deployed vaccines that are very effective against this particular variant, this omicron variant, and so they're very vulnerable to spread right now. They didn't use the time that they bought themselves to really put in place measures that would prevent omicron from spreading,"" said Gottlieb, who is on the board of Covid vaccine maker Pfizer.  The increasing number of BA.2 cases in mainland China has led some major cities on Monday to shutter nonessential businesses and move schools to online instruction. The outbreak is the mainland's worst since the height of the pandemic in 2020, and the strict response to it indicates a continuation of China's zero-Covid strategy.  China's zero-Covid policy entails strict quarantines and travel restrictions both domestic and international. While the policy has successfully kept cases down since the height of the pandemic, health officials have warned that China's resulting lack of exposure to Covid leaves it vulnerable to harder-to-control strains such as omicron.  The latest omicron outbreak in China also has economic repercussions, since it could hinder already struggling supply chains, particularly for tech companies.  Apple shares dropped more than 2% midday, as the Chinese city of Shenzhen's health orders halted activity at production plants of Foxconn, an important supplier to the iPhone maker. Activity will resume once Foxconn receives government approval to do so, the company told CNBC.  Gottlieb said China's outbreak could be bigger than what is being reported, adding uncertainty to the situation.  ""We really don't know how large the outbreak is in China right now,"" Gottlieb said. ""We don't know if there's tens of thousands of cases or hundreds of thousands of cases.""  Mainland China reported 1,437 new confirmed cases as of Sunday for a total of 8,531 domestically transmitted active cases.   ""People are going to get infected in those homes where they're confining people right now, and the big question is: How much infection do they have and how long will this last?"" Gottlieb said.  Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer, genetic testing start-up Tempus, health-care tech company Aetion and biotech company Illumina. He also serves as co-chair of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' and Royal Caribbean's ""Healthy Sail Panel."" "
Can China's digital yuan reduce the dollar's use in international trade?,2022-03-15 06:22:14+00:00,"China's nascent digital yuan is set to challenge the dollar's domination of international trade settlements in the next decade, according to Richard Turrin, author of ""Cashless: China's Digital Currency Revolution.""  ""Remember, China is the largest trading country and you're going to see digital yuan slowly supplant the dollar when buying things from China,"" Turrin told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday.  ""If we go about five to 10 years out, yes the digital yuan can play a significant role in reducing the dollar's usage in international trade,"" said Turrin, a former banker who has also worked in fintech.  The drive toward alternative payment systems is likely to come from a desire by nations to reduce their current, ""mostly 100%"" reliance on the dollar, he said.  ""What you're going to see in the future is a rollback, a risk management exercise that seeks to slowly and maybe just slightly reduce the dependence on dollar, from 100% down to 80%, 85%,"" he said.  China has been ramping up efforts to roll out its central bank digital currency and is currently far ahead in the space compared with global peers.  The People's Bank of China has been working on the digital form of its sovereign currency since 2014. Stateside, the U.S. Federal Reserve has yet to take a stand on whether to issue a digital dollar, while President Joe Biden recently called on the government to place ""urgency"" on the research and development of a potential digital version of the dollar.  Turin said the world's second largest economy is currently ""ahead in all financial technology by a decade."" He added the U.S. would take ""easily another five years"" just to get out of planning and trials for a potential digital dollar.  His comments came as China warily watches the U.S. and its allies' strengthened alliance following the breakout of war between Russia and Ukraine. Beijing has so far deflected blame of the conflict to the U.S. and refused to term Russia's attack an ""invasion.""  Morgan Stanley says these Chinese stocks could rebound — Alibaba, Tencent aren't on the list  Wall Street banks name their favorite Asia stocks — and Citi says one could have upside of 167%  Xpeng and more: Morgan Stanley says these stocks will benefit from rising oil prices  Beijing, however, is unlikely to use the digital yuan to aid Moscow in bypassing the crippling sanctions imposed by the West, according to Turrin.  ""The digital yuan is a baby in the sense that it is in trial but not yet launched domestically nor has it had any testing on an international basis,"" Turrin explained.  On a technical level, this means it would be ""extremely difficult"" for China to use its CBDC to bail out Russia. He said Beijing also probably wants to shield its ""new baby of a currency"" from the mud on the political front.  ""[China] wants eventually to have [the digital yuan] broadly accepted and making it a sanction-buster now when it's still a baby, would not help in that goal,"" Turrin said. "
"China's retail sales, industrial data soundly beat expectations",2022-03-15 05:00:28+00:00,"BEIJING — China reported Tuesday better-than-expected growth in retail sales, fixed asset investment and industrial production to start the year.  The data releases combine the two months of January and February as is the Chinese statistics bureau custom to avoid distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday, which can fall in either month depending on the year.  Retail sales grew by 6.7% year-on-year, topping expectations of analysts polled by Reuters for growth of 3% from a year ago. Furniture was the only category within retail sales to decline, down 6%. Petroleum products and gold, silver and jewelry saw the greatest increases.  Steady growth in auto sales — after declines for much of last year — helped boost retail sales, as well as consumer demand around the Lunar New Year holiday and interest in Olympics-related products, Fu Linghui, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters at a press conference Tuesday.  He noted, however, that recent Covid outbreaks would likely restrict consumption in certain areas, and the foundation for recovery in consumer spending is still not strong.  ""Certainly, achieving the full-year target of around 5.5% will require arduous effort,"" Fu said in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation.  Industrial production also beat, up by 7.5% versus expectations of 3.9% growth.  Fixed asset investment rose by 12.2%, well above the forecast for a 5% increase. Within fixed asset investment, that in high-tech manufacturing saw one of the largest increases, up by 42.7%. Infrastructure investment grew by 8.1%. Investment in real estate development rose by 3.7%, even as commercial floor space sold fell by 9.6%.  The real estate sector — which contributes to about a quarter of GDP — has slumped since Beijing began a crackdown on developers' high reliance on debt in the last two years.  Sian Fenner, lead Asia economist at Oxford Economics, said on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" that she expects increased fiscal spending will boost infrastructure development, but not enough to offset the slowdown in real estate. She anticipates the stimulus will work through the economy, enough to boost growth to an expected 4.9% this year and to near 5.4% next year.  Morgan Stanley says these Chinese stocks could rebound — Alibaba, Tencent aren't on the list  Wall Street banks name their favorite Asia stocks — and Citi says one could have upside of 167%  Xpeng and more: Morgan Stanley says these stocks will benefit from rising oil prices  The unemployment rate in cities edged up to 5.5% in February from January, with that of those aged 16 to 24 remaining far higher at 15.3%.  ""The national economy sustained steady recovery, the production demand grew fast, employment and prices were generally stable, new driving forces continued to develop, and high-quality development made new progress,"" the statistics bureau said in a statement.  Last week, China's central government announced an official GDP target of ""around 5.5%"" for the year.  Many economists said the target is ambitious, especially after a resurgence in Covid cases forced factories to halt production.  Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" ahead of the data release that she is considering a downward revision of her 6.8% GDP forecast because of the Covid situation.  The new restrictions hit major cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai in the worst wave of the pandemic the country has seen since the initial shock just over two years ago.  Those developments will affect the economic recovery at a local level, but not so much at a national level, NBS' Fu said.  But he cautioned that many risks for growth remain in the year ahead.  ""The international environment is rather complex and severe,"" he said. ""In particular, the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and geopolitical tensions have caused high volatility in international commodity prices, and their impact on domestic production cannot be ignored.""  — CNBC's Charmaine Jacob and Chelsea Ong contributed to this report.

Here's everything the Fed is expected to do at its meeting this week,2022-03-16 00:34:24+00:00,"The Federal Reserve this week faces the monumental challenge of starting to undo its massive economic help at a time when conditions are far from ideal.  In the midst of a geopolitical crisis in Ukraine, an economy that is off to a slow start and a stock market in a state of tumult, the Fed is widely expected to start raising interest rates following the conclusion Wednesday of its two-day meeting.  Those three elements pose a daunting challenge, but it's soaring inflation that the Fed will focus on most when its meeting starts Tuesday.  ""The economic outlook supports the Fed's current plans to boost the federal funds rate in March and to begin to reduce their balance sheet over the summer,"" wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds. ""However, there [are] a number of areas of uncertainty which should make them a little more cautious in tightening.""  The Federal Open Market Committee meeting will be focusing on more than a solitary interest rate hike, however. There also will be adjustments to the economic outlook, projections for the future path of rates, and likely a discussion about when the central bank can start reducing its bond portfolio holdings.  Here's a look at how each will play out, according to the prevailing views on Wall Street:  Markets have no doubt the Fed will enact an increase of a quarter-percentage point, or 25 basis points, at this meeting. Because the central bank generally doesn't like to surprise markets, that's almost certainly what will happen.  Where the committee goes from there, however, is hard to tell. Members will update their projections through the ""dot plot"" — in which each official plots one dot on a grid to show where they think rates will go this year, the following two years and the longer range.  ""The '25' is a given. What matters most is what comes after,"" said Simona Mocuta, chief economist at State Street Global Advisors. ""A lot can happen between now and the end of the year. The uncertainty is super high. The trade-offs have worsened considerably.""  Current pricing indicates the equivalent of seven total increases this year — or one at each meeting — a pace Mocuta thinks is too aggressive. However, traders are split evenly over whether the FOMC will hike by 25 or 50 basis points in May should inflation — currently at its highest level since the early 1980s — continue to push higher. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.  From a market perspective, the key assessment will be whether the hike is ""dovish"" — indicative of a cautious path ahead — or ""hawkish,"" in which officials signal they are determined to keep raising rates to fight inflation even if there are some adverse effects on growth.  ""We think the message around the rate hike has to be at least somewhat hawkish. The real question is whether the Fed is carefully hawkish or aggressively hawkish, and whether the meeting springs any surprises or not,"" wrote Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy for Evercore ISI. ""Our call is that the Fed will be carefully hawkish and will avoid springing any surprises that might add to uncertainty and volatility.""  Regardless of exactly how it goes, the dot plot will see substantial revisions from the last update three months ago, in which members penciled in just three hikes this year and about six more over the next two years. The longer run, or terminal rate, also could get boosted up from the 2.5% projection.  The dot plot is part of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) , a table updated quarterly that also includes rough estimates for unemployment, gross domestic product and inflation.  In December, the committee's median expectation for inflation, as gauged by its core preferred personal consumption expenditures price index, pointed to inflation in 2022 running at 2.7%. That figure obviously vastly underestimated the trajectory of inflation, which by February's core PCE reading is up 5.2% from a year ago.  Wall Street economists expect the new inflation outlook to bump up the full-year estimate to about 4%, though gains in subsequent years are expected to move little from December's respective projections of 2.3% and 2.1%.  Forget Tesla — this auto stock is the one to buy right now, analyst says  Josh Brown says Nvidia's potential is 'scary' ahead of a potential AI boom  Bill Miller says there are many good opportunities in the market. Here is where he’s looking  Still, the sharp upward revision to the 2022 figure ""should keep Fed officials focused on the need to respond to too-high inflation with tighter policy settings, especially against a backdrop of strong (if now more uncertain) growth and an historically tight labor market,"" Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst wrote in a Monday note.  Economists figure there also will be adjustments to this year's outlook for GDP, which could be slowed by the war in Ukraine, explosive inflation and tightening in financial conditions. December's SEP pointed to GDP growth of 4% this year; Goldman Sachs recently lowered its full-year outlook to just 2.9%. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow gauge is tracking first-quarter growth of just 0.5%.  ""The war has pushed the Fed staff's geopolitical risk index to the highest level since the Iraq War,"" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a note over the weekend. ""It has already raised food and energy prices and it threatens to create new supply chain disruptions as well.""  The Fed's December projection for unemployment this year was 3.5%, which could be tweaked lower considering the February rate was 3.8%.  Outside the questions over rates, inflation and growth, the Fed also is expected to discuss when it will start paring the bond holdings on its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. To be sure, the central bank is not expected to take any firm action on this issue this week.  The bond-buying program, sometimes called quantitative easing, will wind down this month with a final round of $16.5 billion in mortgage-backed securities purchases. As that ends, the FOMC will start to chart the way it will allow the holdings to start reducing, a program sometimes conversely called quantitative tightening.  ""Balance sheet reduction will likely be discussed but increased uncertainty makes us think formal normalization principles will be announced in May or June,"" Citi's Hollenhorst said.  Most Wall Street estimates figure the Fed will allow about $100 billion in bond proceeds to roll off each month, rather than being reinvested in new bonds as is currently the case. That process is expected to start in the summer, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell likely will be asked to address it during his post-meeting news conference.  Powell's Q&A with the press sometimes moves markets more than the actual post-meeting statement. Mocuta, the State Street economist, said given that Fed policy acts with a lag, generally considered to be six months to a year, Powell should focus more on the future rather than the present.  ""The question remains, where are you going to be in the middle of 2023?"" she said. ""How is inflation, how is growth going to look then? This is the reason I think the Fed should be more dovish and should communicate that."" "
Russian airlines to fly $10 billion worth of foreign-owned planes,2022-03-14 21:57:10+00:00,"Foreign aircraft lessors seeking to recover some $10 billion worth of planes from Russia were dealt a new blow Monday when President Vladimir Putin signed a law clearing the country's airlines to fly the planes domestically.  Sanctions and reciprocal airspace closures in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month have cut off the country's air travel market. Boeing and Airbus have said they will no longer supply parts to its airlines. That could force carriers to cannibalize other jets for parts.  There are some 728 Western-built aircraft in the country's airlines' fleets, 515 of them leased by foreign lessors, according to Jefferies. Under European Union sanctions, aircraft lessors — some of which are based in EU member Ireland — have until March 28 to recover the planes.  Under the new rules set Monday, the Kremlin will allow the country to provide airworthiness certificates to the planes and register them in Russia, according to state news agency Tass. The law was in the works last week.  ""There's an occasional nightmare but the idea of an entire aviation market being taken offline and flouting international laws, that's new,"" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of aviation consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.  Aeroflot and S7, two of Russia's biggest airlines, last week stopped flying internationally. Flights abroad could risk lessors moving to repossess the planes. "
Amazon slams Reliance takeover of Future stores as 'fraud' in Indian newspaper ads,2022-03-15 05:54:38+00:00,"Amazon.com has gone on the attack in its bitter dispute with two Indian retailers, accusing them of fraud in Indian newspaper ads on Tuesday after Reliance Industries suddenly took over many of Future Retail stores.   Amazon has been contesting the planned $3.4 billion sale of Future Group's retail assets to Reliance, first announced in 2020, and the case is currently before the Indian Supreme Court.   Reliance, India's biggest conglomerate and retailer run by the country's richest man, began taking over the prized real estate with utmost stealth on Feb.25 when its staff showed up at many of Future biggest stores to assume control, sources have told Reuters.   In ads headlined ""PUBLIC NOTICE"" in leading Indian newspapers on Tuesday, Amazon said: ""these actions have been done in a clandestine manner by playing a fraud on the constitutional courts in India.""   Future and Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Amazon's public outcry comes even though on March 3 it offered to hold talks. The ongoing talks have raised hopes the dispute could be resolved.   Future has said in filings this month that it could not pay rent at many outlets given its distressed financial situation and that Reliance, which had taken over many of its leases, had issued it with termination notices.   Amazon is concerned that Reliance is continuing to take over Future stores even as the talks continue, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter who was not authorized to speak to media and declined to be identified.   The newspaper ads were aimed at alerting all stakeholders, including Future's lenders, that the transfer of assets to Reliance is legally prohibited, the source added.  "
Live updates: Latest news on Russia and the war in Ukraine,2022-03-18 07:40:16+00:00,"This is CNBC's live blog tracking Thursday's developments on the war in Ukraine. See below for the latest updates.   The U.S. Department of Defense said there was a 24-hour period with ""little activity"" and no observed shelling in Ukraine, according to an update posted Thursday evening in Washington.  There were subsequent, unconfirmed reports of explosions Friday morning in Lviv, a city in Western Ukraine near the Polish border. Military reports on the ground remain difficult to confirm as the situation is fluid.  Ukrainian officials have said Russian attacks across Ukraine have resulted in numerous civilian deaths over the past day.  There are reportedly survivors in the rubble of a bombed theater in the besieged city of Mariupol, it emerged on Thursday. More than a thousand civilians were said to be sheltering in the building.  Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered a scathing address to German lawmakers on Thursday morning, urging Germany to do more to help Ukraine.  Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden are set to speak Friday evening Beijing time, Chinese state media announced Thursday. The reports did not specifically mention Ukraine by name.  In the run-up to the call, Chinese state media have tacked away from primarily pro-Russian coverage of the war in Ukraine. Even Qin Gang, China's ambassador to the U.S., said up front in a op-ed in the Washington Post on Wednesday that the conflict is not good for China, and Beijing would have tried to prevent it if they had known ahead of time.  But one of the consistent state media messages has stuck to blaming the U.S. for making the tensions worse.  People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, put a headline about the upcoming Xi-Biden call in a prominent spot on its website's front page on Friday. Several lines below it was a headline for an editorial blaming the U.S. for holding double standards.  — Evelyn Cheng  The U.S. Department of Defense said there has been ""little activity"" in Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the past day, according to an update posted Thursday evening in Washington.  ""We have observed [continued Russian] naval activity in the north Black Sea off the coast of Odesa, but no shelling over the course of the last 24 hours that we observed,"" an official said.   While the Pentagon said there were 24 hours with little activity, subsequent reports Friday morning indicate shelling in Lviv, Ukraine. CNBC was unable to independently verify those reports. The situation on the ground across Ukraine remains fluid, and details of fighting are difficult to confirm.  The Pentagon official also said, in terms of ground movements, Russian troops were basically where they have been since yesterday. The Pentagon said the situation, however, is not a stalemate. Rather, the department said Ukrainians are actively resisting Russian movement.  Separately, the U.K. Ministry of Defence said logistical problems continue to plague Russian forces. The issues prevent Russia from supplying their troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel, the ministry said Thursday.  ""Incessant Ukranian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert large numbers of troops to defend their own supply lines. This is severely limiting Russia's offensive potential,"" the ministry said.  — Weizhen Tan  China may ""have leverage on Russia that it can use to try to de-escalate"" the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, said Alexander Lanoszka, assistant professor of international relations at the University of Waterloo.  ""But if nothing else, I think what the Biden administration is trying to do here is to demonstrate that there are certain states involved, that this is a core interest for both Europe and the United States ... and China may want to tread very carefully given the trading relationships that are at play here.""  Despite reports that Russia has sought military assistance from China, Lanoszka said it is ""not entirely clear"" what sort of military assistance China can really provide. He added that China doesn't take a strong interest in picking a fight with either the U.S. or the EU, and is reluctant to get ""too involved with respect to Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine.""   However, he said, while there are many risks involved, ""given Russia's weakening international position, China might very well swoop in, take what it can at a very discounted rate, and try to do so in a manner that does not necessarily antagonize or upset the West too much.""  — Toh Ee Ming  China's trade surplus shot to record highs as people consumed more goods than ever before during the pandemic. But the Russia-Ukraine war could bring those numbers down, analysts said.  The Asian giant's trade surplus could narrow to $238 billion this year – about 35% of the historic $676 billion reached in 2021, according to estimates from ANZ Research.  Some factors hitting China's trade include growth shocks to some of its major trading partners due to the war, the disruption of chip and nickel supplies, as well as elevated energy prices.  ""The war in Ukraine will soon start to weigh on net trade due to softer foreign demand and a higher import bill,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at research firm Capital Economics.  — Weizhen Tan  The Ukraine Catholic Parish in Dresden, Germany collects donations for refugees.  — Scott Mlyn  More than 700 people have died since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.   ""The total consists of 726 people killed, including 52 children, and 1,174 injured including 63 children,"" Ghebreyesus said, adding that ""the actual number is likely much higher.""  The destruction of infrastructure has led to a severe disruption to health services and access to basic commodities, he said.   He added that the WHO has verified 43 attacks on healthcare facilities and has tracked at least 12 deaths.  ""In any conflict, attacks on healthcare are a violation of international humanitarian law,"" he added.  – Amanda Macias  The U.S. House overwhelmingly voted to strip Russia of its protected trading status, passing the legislation on to the Senate in the first step allowing the U.S. to levy fresh taxes on more of the nation's goods.  The measure has wide support in the Senate as the U.S. and its allies move to do more damage to Russia's economy in response to Moscow's three-week long assault on Ukraine. President Joe Biden endorsed the move last week.  Underscoring the broad support for hampering the Russian economy, the House passed the measure in a 424-8 vote.  — Jacob Pramuk  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he believes Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine, citing numerous instances of attacks on civilians.  ""President Biden said that, in his opinion, war crimes have been committed in Ukraine. Personally, I agree. Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,"" Blinken said during a press conference at the State Department.  ""After all, the destruction of the past three weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,"" he added.  — Amanda Macias  Some creditors have received payment, in dollars, of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week, two market sources said on Thursday, meaning Russia may for now have averted what would have been its first external bond default in a century.  The Russian finance ministry said earlier that it had sent funds to cover $117 million in coupon payments on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds.  The payments, due on March 16 but with a 30-day grace period, are seen as the first test of whether Moscow will meet its international debt obligations after Western sanctions hobbled its financial dealings. ""The coupon was paid, against my expectations, and in dollars,"" one person said. Another person said the money had been received by a client who was a bondholder.  Some other creditors said they had yet to receive their funds but were optimistic they were on the way, noting they had received payments on hard currency bonds from a raft of state-run and private Russian companies in recent days.  — Reuters  A U.S. citizen was among those killed in an attack Thursday on the besieged northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, a State Department spokesperson confirmed.  ""We can confirm the death of a U.S. citizen in Ukraine on March 17. We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss. Out of respect to the family during this difficult time, we have no further comment,"" the spokesperson wrote.  The State Department did not comment further on the circumstances around the death nor provide details on the person's identity.  – Amanda Macias  — Adam Jeffery  Russia appears to have avoided defaulting on its sovereign debt despite the sanctions hampering its central bank.   Reuters, citing a source familiar with the situation, reported on Thursday that Russia made two payments in dollars and that the money would soon be distributed to bondholders.  The debt market drama comes as Russia has largely been cut out of the global financial system due to its war in Ukraine. In order to avoid default, Russia needed to make the payments in dollars and not the rapidly weakening ruble.   It was unclear if foreign banks would process the payments or allow Russia to access its accounts.  — Jesse Pound  Photos show a damaged building at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant compound in southeastern Ukraine amid Russia's invasion of the country.   — Adam Jeffery  U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reiterated that America does not want to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine because it would mean ""combat"" with Russian forces.  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pleaded with the U.S. and its NATO allies to set up a no-fly zone to stem Russian bombing that has devastated Ukrainian civilians. The Biden administration has declined to do so because it could mean direct conflict with Russian forces.  Biden has said the U.S. will not send troops to Ukraine, but he approved $800 million in new defense assistance on Wednesday.  Austin, speaking at a joint news conference with Slovakian Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad, added that the U.S. State Department is reviewing Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine.  — Jacob Pramuk  Ukraine prepares to defend Odessa from Russian attacks on the strategic Black Sea port city.  — Adam Jeffery  The crop and energy price increases driven by Russia's assault on Ukraine are hurting some of the world's most vulnerable rural communities, the United Nations said.   The UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development noted that the war will hurt not only food insecure people who rely on crops like wheat from Russia and Ukraine, but also small farmers who face increased costs for energy and fertilizer.   ""We are already seeing price hikes and this could cause an escalation of hunger and poverty with dire implications for global stability,"" IFAD President Gilbert Houngbo said in a statement.  The UN agency said farmers or rural communities in countries such as Somalia, Egypt and Lebanon could feel disproportionate pain from rising prices.   — Jacob Pramuk  A memorial and funeral service for fallen Ukrainian soldiers has taken place in Lviv.  At the weekend, Russian missiles pounded a military base near the city, which is only 20 miles (33 km) from the border with NATO nation Poland. Ukraine officials said 35 people were killed and 135 injured in the attack.  — Adam Jeffery  President Joe Biden will speak with President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China this Friday, the White House announced.  The discussion comes amid warnings from Washington that the world's second-largest economy should not come to Russia's aid following rounds of punishing sanctions.  ""The two leaders will discuss managing the competition between our two countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine and other issues of mutual concern,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement.  The call follows an intense seven-hour meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Rome on Monday. The U.S. delegation, led by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, conveyed to Beijing's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, that China should not assist Russia amid the Kremlin's ongoing war in Ukraine.  — Amanda Macias  Lithuania's Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on Thursday that calls on the U.N. to ""take immediate action to secure a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stop the mass deaths of civilians.""  Lithuania is the second country to officially ask for a no-fly zone above Ukraine, Estonia being the first.  Ukrainian officials have been urging Western allies to impose a no-fly zone over the country for weeks.  But the leaders of NATO, the U.S. and the U.K. have ruled such a move out, arguing that a no-fly zone could only be enforced by shooting down Russian planes — which they say would only escalate the war.  — Chloe Taylor  Moscow's attempts to justify attacks on the Ukrainian city of Mariupol are a ""sick disgrace,"" a U.S. official said Thursday.  Michael Carpenter, U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in an address to the organization's Permanent Council in Vienna that the ""heartbreaking"" bombing of a theater in Mariupol yesterday — where hundreds of civilians had taken shelter — was an act of ""cruelty and evil.""  Mariupol has been the center of intense conflict in recent weeks, with the Red Cross saying that hundreds of thousands of civilians had been trapped in the city. There have since been some successful evacuations, but early attempts to get civilians out of the city were halted when Ukraine said Russian forces were violating cease-fire agreements.  Last week, Moscow claimed that photos of pregnant women being carried out of a bombed maternity hospital in Mariupol were staged, saying there were no patients in the hospital when it was shelled — despite the photographic evidence.    Carpenter told the OSCE Thursday that these claims were ""a sick disgrace,"" and ""abject debasement.""  He added the Kremlin was also spreading ""outright lies"" about chemical and biological weapons activities in Ukraine.  ""It appears that the Russian Federation has so completely lost touch with reality that its only recourse now is to attempt to eliminate all facts and replace them with fabricated falsehoods,"" Carpenter said.    A spokesperson for the Russian government was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.  — Chloe Taylor  In a regular press briefing Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Russia and Ukraine were not close to signing an agreement on ending the war.  ""Work continues — when there is progress, we will inform,"" he said, according to an NBC News translation.  He added that the Russian delegation was ""ready to work around the clock,"" but claimed that ""the Ukrainian side does not show zeal.""  Officials from both the Russian and Ukrainian sides have said in recent days that there has seemed to be hope for compromise in the latest rounds of talks.  — Chloe Taylor  U.S. President Joe Biden's branding of Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a war criminal is ""inadmissible,"" the Kremlin said Thursday.  ""Such statements by Biden are absolutely inadmissible and inexcusable,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a regular briefing.   ""And most importantly, the head of [the] state which bombed people all over the world for many years, dropped atomic bombs on a country that had already been defeated, cannot have the right to make them. The president of such a country has no right to such words at all, this is our deep conviction.""  Biden said Wednesday that he believes Putin ""is a war criminal"" for his attacks on Ukraine, marking the first time Biden has publicly labeled Putin with that descriptor.  — Chloe Taylor  Ukraine's Presidential Office has confirmed that nine humanitarian corridors have been agreed to allow the evacuation of civilians on Thursday.  The confirmation came after Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced earlier in the morning that the routes had been negotiated.  Civilians will be evacuated from towns and cities in the Donetsk region, the Kyiv region and the Kharkiv region, Vereshchuk said.  — Chloe Taylor  The bomb shelter inside the Mariupol theater hit by Russian shelling yesterday has held up, a local official has told the BBC.  Dmytro Gurin, a lawmaker from the besieged city, told the BBC Thursday that more than 1,000 women and children had taken shelter in the theater. But authorities were not yet aware if anyone had been injured or killed, he added.  Russia has denied being responsible for the bombing.  Satellite images taken on March 14 by U.S. government-linked Maxar appear to show the theater prior to the bombing, with the word ""children"" spelled out — in Russian — in large letters in front of and behind the building.  — Chloe Taylor  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has addressed lawmakers in Germany's Bundestag.  Speaking via videolink, Ukraine's President warned that ""obviously sanctions are not enough to stop this war.""  He accused Germany of acting too late to help Ukraine, and of prioritizing its own economy over ending the conflict.  Germany has been criticized for what many view as meager investment in its military and a slow and lackluster response to Russia's military buildup around, and subsequent invasion of, Ukraine.  ""Not all of you notice yet, but you're not behind the Berlin wall now, you're in the middle of Europe,"" Zelenskyy said to German politicians on Thursday.  ""If you just look over this wall, you will see … you could have done a Berlin air bridge to make our skies safe.""   Zelenskyy warned that if Germany did not take more action to stop the war, ""Europe will not survive, will not preserve its values.""  Appealing directly to Germans who lived through the Second World War, Zelenskyy added: ""Every year the politicians say: 'Never again.' These words are not worth anything.""  ""Where is your leadership?"" he said. ""Why is the country beyond the Atlantic closer to us than you? There's a wall. [As] former U.S. President Ronald Reagan said in Berlin, break down this wall. And I want to say to you, Chancellor Scholz, break down this wall.""  — Chloe Taylor  Russia on Wednesday denied its forces had bombed a theater in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where more than a thousand civilians were said to be sheltering.  The bombing of the theater was condemned by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba as a war crime.  ""Today the invaders destroyed the Drama Theatre. A place where more than a thousand people found refuge,"" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said in a statement late Wednesday night. ""We will never forgive this.""  Russia's Ministry of Defense said in a statement Wednesday that it denied allegations it was responsible for the attack, claiming that its forces ""did not perform any tasks related to imposing strikes on ground targets in Mariupol"" on March 16.  Satellite images from Maxar taken on March 14 appear to show the theater prior to the bombing, with the word ""children"" spelled out — in Russian — in large letters in front of and behind the building.  Maxar provides 90% of the foundational geospatial intelligence used by the U.S. government for national security.  Details of victims of the bombing have not yet been released.  Authorities have struggled to evacuate residents from Mariupol, where the Red Cross says hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped by the conflict. There have been successful evacuations in recent days, but early evacuation attempts had to be halted because Ukrainian authorities said Russia was violating cease-fire agreements in the city.  — Chloe Taylor  Viacheslav Chaus, governor of the Chernihiv region, said Thursday via Telegram that Russian attacks had led to multiple civilian deaths on Wednesday.  ""We suffer great losses. Just yesterday, the city morgues received 53 bodies of our citizens who were killed by the Russian aggressor,"" he said.  CNBC has not been able to independently verify the figures.  — Chloe Taylor  Serhiy Haidai, head of the Luhansk regional state administration, said Thursday morning that at least 27 houses in the city of Rubizhne had been set on fire in shelling strikes overnight.  ""The Russians made hell in Rubizhne on the night of March 16-17, and the shelling lasted all night,"" he said in a Telegram post.  Haidai said there had also been fires in the cities of Popasna and Sievierodonetsk, and that information about victims of the bombings was being clarified.  ""The townspeople are losing their relatives, their homes are burning,"" he said. ""However, the Russian army continues to purposefully fire on civilians who are not even allowed to leave safely.""  CNBC has not been able to independently verify the details of the attacks.  — Chloe Taylor  One person was killed in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday morning when an apartment block was bombed, Ukraine's State Emergency Services have said.  The multi-story building in the Darnytsky district of the capital caught fire after being hit by a missile, authorities said.  ""According to preliminary information, 30 people were evacuated, three of whom were injured,"" the SES said in a statement. ""One person has been killed. The information is being specified.""  — Chloe Taylor  You can read Wednesday's live coverage here:   Biden calls Putin a 'war criminal'; NATO chief demands Russia stop the war  Russian forces have made ""minimal"" progress in their invasion of Ukraine in recent days and continue to suffer heavy losses, the U.K. Ministry of Defence said Thursday.  ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has largely stalled on all fronts,"" including land, sea and air, the ministry said in a intelligence update.  Ukrainian resistance remains stubborn and well coordinated, the ministry said, with all major Ukrainian cities and most territory still in Ukrainian hands.  In response to a request for comment, Russia's Defense Ministry directed CNBC to an English-language statement from March 1 which said in part that its armed forces ""will continue [the] special operation in Ukraine until complete of all objectives.""  — Ted Kemp  Russian forces attacking Ukraine are likely turning to less precise heavy weapons that are less effective from a military standpoint and more likely to kill civilians, a European government said.  The U.K. Defence Ministry said late Wednesday local time that Russia has expended more of its ""stand-off air launched weapons"" than it had expected, because it has failed to achieve its objectives or to gain control of Ukrainian airspace.  ""Stand-off"" weaponry refers to missiles that Russian aircraft can fire from a long distance without exposing themselves to Ukrainian anti-aircraft weapons. Ukraine's anti-aircraft capabilities are still active and taking down Russian helicopters and jets.  ""As a result, it is likely Russia is resorting to the use of older, less precise weapons, which are less militarily effective and more likely to result in civilian casualties,"" the ministry said in an intelligence update.  In response to a request for comment, the Russian Ministry of Defense directed CNBC to a statement from more than two weeks ago which said in part that Russian forces carry out strikes only on military targets ""using high-precision weapons.""  However, overwhelming photographic and video evidence, as well as official assessments from the United States, United Kingdom and others, show that Russia is in fact striking civilian targets with unguided weapons.  Weapons like rockets, ""dumb"" unguided bombs, and long-range artillery are less accurate and therefore more likely to hit unintended targets.  According to the most recent confirmed UN figures, more than 700 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the invasion began, but the actual number is likely to be much higher.  Death tolls from cities under artillery bombardment, such as Kharkiv and Mariupol, are unknown.  — Ted Kemp "
Bank of England hikes rates for third time in a row,2022-03-17 19:42:54+00:00,"LONDON — The Bank of England on Thursday raised interest rates for the third consecutive meeting but struck a more dovish tone as the Russia-Ukraine conflict is expected to keep inflation higher for longer.  The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 in favor of a further 0.25 percentage point hike to its main Bank Rate, taking it to 0.75%.  U.K. inflation was already running at a 30-year high prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which sent energy prices surging and will exert more upward pressure on the central bank's inflation projections.  At its last meeting in February, the Monetary Policy Committee imposed back-to-back interest rate hikes for the first time since 2004 and upped its forecast for inflation to a 7.25% peak in April, against a backdrop of strong growth and a robust labor market in the U.K.  The Bank said at the time that any further tightening of monetary policy would depend on the medium-term prospects for inflation, which were then propelled upward by Moscow's assault on Ukraine and subsequent threats to energy supply.  ""Global inflationary pressures will strengthen considerably further over coming months, while growth in economies that are net energy importers, including the United Kingdom, is likely to slow,"" the Bank said in Thursday's report.  The Bank now expects inflation to increase further in the coming months to around 8% in the second quarter of 2022, and perhaps even higher later in the year.  Given the tightness of the labor market and persistent domestic cost and price pressures, the MPC also said that ""some further modest tightening in monetary policy may be appropriate in the coming months,"" though the risks are two-sided depending on the development of medium-term inflation prospects.  Sterling retreated following the announcement, shedding 0.3% against the dollar, while the euro gained around 0.5% against the pound.  Paul Craig, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said in reaction to the Bank's increased inflation projections that it now seems ""ultimately a double-digit inflation rate is not off the cards.""  ""The BoE had no choice but to keep raising rates. It is looking to build in some insurance now should there be a slowdown in economic growth or employment comes in worse than feared,"" Craig said.  ""With global risks and the Russia-Ukraine war having a significant economic impact, growth will be challenged and thus the Bank may need to reverse course later in the year.""  For now though, Craig suggested the Bank will need to continue its tightening path to prevent a further devaluation of sterling, which would exacerbate the cost of living crisis gripping U.K. households.  ""Savings rates could improve from here which might offset some of the cost of living crunch, but with inflation proving difficult to contain it might all be a little too late,"" he added.  Vivek Paul, U.K. chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, said the normalization of policy rates to their pre-pandemic levels and the end of quantitative easing made sense, with the country's strong economic rebound showing further stimulus is no longer necessary.  The U.K. economy grew by 7.5% in 2021, clawing back much of its pandemic-era contraction.  ""Yet headwinds caused by the Ukraine war including sharply higher energy prices could slow the economy's momentum later this year,"" said Paul.  ""With market expectations yesterday for the base rate close to 2.2% by the end of the year – higher even than before the Ukraine war began – markets are betting that the Bank's rate path from here will be extremely aggressive in the near-term.""  Although BlackRock does see more tightening over the coming years, Paul suggested that there is ""excessive hawkishness"" in most developed markets, since overly aggressive hiking from central banks would exact a heavy toll on growth.  ""Current market pricing points to a front-loading of rate hikes followed by a series of cuts, illustrating the risk of overtightening,"" said Paul.  ""Clear communication will be key, in our view, for the Bank to avoid creating confusion by over-tightening financial conditions and hurting the real economy."" "
"Russia makes some debt payments in dollars, report says, as it seeks to avoid historic debt default",2022-03-18 22:20:19+00:00,"Russia successfully made at least some of the payments on its sovereign bonds in dollars, according to reports from Reuters, appearing to avoid a historic debt default.  Reuters, citing a source familiar with the situation, reported on Thursday that Russia made payments on its sovereign bonds in dollars to its banks and that money would be distributed to bondholders. The news outlet also reported that some creditors had received those payments.  The delivery of payment on the two eurobond coupons is a key test for Russia. The Kremlin is staring down the prospect of its first foreign currency debt default in more than a century after the U.S. and international allies imposed a barrage of economic sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.  The penalties have blocked a bulk of Russia's gold and foreign exchange reserves and sought to cut off Moscow from the global financial system.  Russia had until the end of business Wednesday to fulfill its obligations and pay $117 million in interest on two sovereign eurobonds.  Russia's Finance Ministry claimed earlier Thursday it had fulfilled crucial interest payments on two dollar-denominated eurobonds, saying the order had been made to payment agent Citibank in London.  The ministry said it would later comment separately on whether the $117 million in total payments has been credited. Citibank declined to comment when contacted by CNBC on Thursday morning.  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reportedly said Thursday that any potential default would be ""entirely artificial"" because Russia had the funds necessary to fulfill its external debt obligations.  ""The fact is that from the very beginning we have said that Russia has all the necessary funds and potential to prevent a default — there can be no defaults,"" Peskov said, according to Reuters.  ""Any default that could arise would have an entirely artificial character,"" he added.  Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Wednesday that Russia had attempted to deliver the payment and it was now up to the U.S. to decide whether it went through.  It was not immediately clear whether the order had been made in dollars amid speculation Russia could attempt to pay in rubles.  Credit ratings agency Fitch warned earlier this week that payment to bondholders in a currency other than dollars would constitute a default.  ""Russia blinked,"" Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said via email.  ""It used resources in its limited war chest, beyond the reach of Western sanctions to make the payment. Let's see if it ends up with bondholders.""  Ash suggested Russia had realized ""the price of default was much larger.""  Citibank, as a paying agent to Russia's foreign bondholders, has been thrust into the spotlight while investors await clarity on whether Moscow has been able to administer its debt payments.  A paying agent plays the administrative role of receiving and processing payments to a security holder on behalf of the issuer. It is not typically permitted to disclose confidential and financial information.  The prospect of nonpayment would kick-start a 30-day grace period before Russia falls into technical default, but the Kremlin will likely contend that Western sanctions prevented it from completing the payment.  If confirmed following the grace period, the nonpayment would mark Russia's first sovereign default since 1998, when it defaulted on domestic debt, and the first sovereign default on foreign currency debt since 1918 during the Bolshevik Revolution.  Economists had been unsure as to how Russia's Ministry of Finance would approach the payment in light of sanctions on the Central Bank of Russia that rendered much of its foreign exchange reserves inaccessible, prompting a slew of credit downgrades from the major global ratings agencies.  — CNBC's Elliot Smith contributed to this report.

Nickel falls 8% to hit limit down in chaotic trade on London Metal Exchange,2022-03-17 22:51:22+00:00,"LONDON — The benchmark three-month nickel contract fell 8% on Thursday morning to hit its new trading limit, as heavy selling continued in metal markets.  The price hit $41,945 a metric ton as it opened for trade, according to Refinitiv data. Nickel prices more than doubled in a matter of hours on March 8, climbing above $100,000 a metric ton as one of the world's top producers, China's Tsingshan Holding Group, bought large amounts to reduce its short bets on the metal.  Trading had to be halted as the move exacerbated a price rally at a time when metals were already spiraling upward on Russia's intensifying conflict in Ukraine.  On Wednesday, the LME attempted to resume nickel trading after the rare shut down. But a technical glitch prompted the 145-year-old exchange to temporarily halt the market once again, before trading reopened at 2 p.m. London time.  The LME installed a trading limit of 5% on Wednesday which was widened to 8% for Thursday. The ""systems error"" on Wednesday allowed a small number of trades to go through below the newly imposed daily price limit.  Speaking before the open on Wednesday, Matthew Chamberlain, CEO of the LME, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" that the exchange was ""absolutely mindful of the impact that this has had on so many people and we need to make sure that it doesn't happen again.""  Chamberlain said the LME had ""deliberately prioritized stability"" by setting a relatively narrow range of daily trading limits, but these could soon be widened if the exchange observed a ""more orderly market.""  Commodity prices have jumped on supply fears related to Russia's onslaught of Ukraine, with the ongoing war and an array of Western sanctions raising disruption fears. "

"Federal Reserve approves first interest rate hike in more than three years, sees six more ahead",2022-03-17 10:18:55+00:00,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved its first interest rate increase in more than three years, an incremental salvo to address spiraling inflation without torpedoing economic growth.  After keeping its benchmark interest rate anchored near zero since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee said it will raise rates by a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points.  That will bring the rate now into a range of 0.25%-0.5%. The move will correspond with a hike in the prime rate and immediately send financing costs higher for many forms of consumer borrowing and credit. Fed officials indicated the rate increases will come with slower economic growth this year.  Along with the rate hikes, the committee also penciled in increases at each of the six remaining meetings this year, pointing to a consensus funds rate of 1.9% by year's end. That is a full percentage point higher than indicated in December. The committee sees three more hikes in 2023 then none the following year.  The rate rise was approved with only one dissent. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard wanted a 50 basis point increase.  The committee last raised rates in December 2018, then had to backtrack the following July and begin cutting.  In its post-meeting statement, the FOMC said it also ""anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate."" Addressing the Fed's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, made up mainly of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it has purchased over the years, the statement said, ""In addition, the Committee expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting.""  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at his post-meeting news conference hinted that the balance sheet reduction could start in May, and said the process could be the equivalent of another rate hike this year.  The indication of about 175 basis points in rate increases this year was a close call: The ""dot plot"" of individual members' projections showed eight members expecting more than the seven hikes, while 10 thought that seven total in 2022 would be sufficient.  ""We are attentive to the risks of further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations,"" Powell said at the news conference. ""The committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. The U.S. economy is very strong and well-positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.""  Officials also adjusted their economic outlook on multiple fronts, seeing much higher inflation than they expected in December and considerably slower GDP growth.  The bond market is sending a recession signal. Here's when investors should take it seriously  Buy these 'safe haven' global tech stocks as risk-appetite returns, Morgan Stanley says  Morgan Stanley says these hydrogen stocks will win as countries build up their energy infrastructure  As Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’ drops, these riskier stocks should pop  Committee members bumped up their inflation estimates, expecting the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy to reflect 4.1% growth this year, compared with the 2.7% projection in December 2021. Core PCE is expected to be 2.7% and 2.3%, respectively, in the next two years before settling to 2% over the longer term.  ""Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures,"" the statement said.  On GDP, December's 4% was sliced to 2.8%, as the committee particularly noted the potential implications of the Ukraine war. Subsequent years were unchanged. The committee still expects the unemployment rate to end this year at 3.5%.  ""The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,"" the statement said. ""The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.""  Stocks initially reacted negative to the announcement but then bounced back. Bond yields momentarily moved higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rising to 2.22% before receding.  ""Ultimately, they've come through with a clear message, that the Fed has a path forward to continue to tighten in response to this overwhelming concern around inflation,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. ""The question is, will it be enough and are they even recognizing that they've ... perhaps fallen behind the curve?""  The central bank had slashed its federal funds rate in the early days of the pandemic to combat a shutdown that crippled the U.S. economy and financial markets while sending 22 million Americans to the unemployment line.  But myriad factors have combined to force the Fed's hand on inflation, a condition that policymakers last year dismissed as ""transitory"" before capitulating. Officials over the past two months have strongly indicated that interest rate hikes are coming, with the main question left for investors being how many increases and how quickly they would come.  The current trend of price increases, at their fastest 12-month pace in 40 years, has been fed by demand that has far outstripped supply chains that remain clogged if less so than their pandemic-era peaks. Unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus — more than $10 trillion worth – have coincided with the inflation surge. And the Ukraine war has coincided with a major spike in oil prices, though that has abated in recent days.  Heading into this week's FOMC meeting, markets had been pricing in the equivalent of about seven 0.25% hikes this year, according to CME Group data. However, traders were split about 50-50 over whether the Fed might hike 50 basis points in May, as some officials have indicated could happen if inflation pressures persist.  Prices are up 7.9% year over year, according to the consumer price index, which measures a wide-ranging basket of goods and services. Energy has been the biggest burden, as gasoline prices have risen 38% in the 12-month period.  However, price pressures have broadened out from simply gas and groceries.  For instance, clothing prices, after plummeting in the early days of the pandemic, have risen 6.6% over the past year. Motor vehicle repair costs are up 6.3% and airline fares have jumped 12.7%. Rent of shelter costs, which make up nearly one-third of the CPI, have been moving up sharply in recent months and are up 4.8% year over year.  All of those cost increases have left the Fed's 2% inflation target in the dust.  The Fed in September 2020 approved a new approach to inflation, in which it would let it run hotter in the interest of a full and, most notably, inclusive employment goal that spans across race, gender and wealth. However, the change in approach was followed almost immediately by more pernicious inflation than the U.S. economy had seen since the days of the Arab oil embargo and inflation that peaked in the early 1980s at nearly 15%.  In those days, the Paul Volcker-led Fed had to jack up interest rates to a point where they tipped the economy into recession, something central bankers now want to avoid. Back then, the funds rate eclipsed 19%.  Baird said the Fed will need to live up to its promise to be ""nimble"" if it is to continue to assuage market fears about runaway inflation.  ""Will the path that they've laid out be enough to bring inflation back down to more comfortable levels in some reasonable time frame? The possibility certainly exists that they could get more aggressive,"" he said. "
Kanye West has been suspended from Instagram ,2022-03-17 15:26:28+00:00,"Kanye West has been suspended from Instagram for 24 hours for breaching the social media network's harassment policy.  West, who goes by ""Ye,"" will not be able to post, comment or send direct messages for 24 hours.  A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Instagram, told CNBC Thursday that West violated the firm's policies on hate speech and bullying and harassment.  Meta, which did not disclose the details of the post, said further action could be taken against West if he continues to offend in the future.  A representative for West did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.  A report from showbiz publication Variety on Wednesday said West directed racial slurs at Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show,"" in an Instagram post that has now been deleted.  The alleged slur reportedly came after Noah discussed an argument between West, West's former wife Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, ""Saturday Night Live"" comic Pete Davidson.  Kardashian filed for divorce a year ago, citing irreconcilable differences with West. The couple have four children together. Following the divorce, West publicly criticized Kardashian's relationship with Davidson on social media and asked her to return to him.  Meta did not immediately respond when CNBC asked what time the suspension came into effect and what time it will be lifted.  Matt Navarra, a social media consultant, told CNBC that 24 hours feels like an ""oddly specific"" amount of time.  ""Why not 48 hours, or a week, or longer?"" he said. ""There's a frustrating lack of clarity from Meta over why this specific incident warranted a 24 hour suspension vs. say, a one week ban. How can Instagram users trust the platform when Meta's rule break penalties feel like they are made up as it goes along.""  He added that some may question whether a regular non-famous Instagram user would get a lengthier suspension for a similar incident.  ""This incident reignites the debate on whether high-profile users such as celebrities with huge followings should be treated the same as regular users when it comes to their conduct on social media platforms, or are companies like Meta making exceptions and offering preferential treatment.""

"ECB has 'extra space' before first rate hike, Lagarde says",2022-03-17 10:27:41+00:00,"FRANKFURT, March 17 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has given itself ""extra space"" between the planned end of its money-printing program this summer and the first interest rate hike in more than a decade, ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.  Investors were ramping up their bets on higher ECB rates after the Federal Reserve raised the cost of borrowing late on Wednesday, tightening its stance for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic and despite uncertainty stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Central banks worldwide have been caught on the hop by a surge in inflation, which hit 5.9% in the 19-nation euro zone last month after spending most of the last decade below the ECB's 2% target.  But, in a repeat of last week's message, Lagarde said that any increase in the ECB's policy rate will be gradual and come only ""some time"" after its bond-buying program, which should happen in the third quarter of the year barring more financial turmoil.   ""This maintains our traditional sequencing logic, but also gives us extra space if needed after we stop purchasing bonds and before we take the next step towards normalization,"" she told a conference in Frankfurt.  Money markets were pricing in increases worth nearly 50 basis points to the ECB's deposit rate by the end of this year, which would take it back to zero after eight years in negative territory.  Lagarde added that the ECB could devise new tools to ensure monetary policy reaches all corners of the euro zone even as it winds down its bond purchases.  These have helped cap the spread between the borrowing costs paid by top-rated Germany and those of indebted countries like Italy and Greece.  ""If necessary, we can design and deploy new instruments to secure monetary policy transmission as we move along the path of policy normalization, as we have shown on many occasions in the past,"" Lagarde said.

China's elevated Covid cases may not hit the economy as hard as feared,2022-03-17 08:55:02+00:00,"BEIJING — As China tackles its worst Covid-19 outbreak since the initial phase of the pandemic, consumption looks set to be hit the hardest while factories find ways to keep producing.  Mainland China reported for Wednesday a second-straight day of declines in new confirmed cases.  The 1,226 new locally transmitted cases reported for the day is only the lowest since Friday, when the new daily case count was a far lower 476, according to National Health Commission data. Mainland China has not reported new deaths from the latest wave of Covid cases, and those numbers are still well below that of other major countries.  The omicron wave is ""more similar to the power shortage episode from late last year,"" said Dan Wang, Shanghai-based chief economist at Hang Seng China. She was referring to abrupt factory power cuts in the fall that temporarily affected production.  This time around, Wang expects factories to be affected for at most two weeks, shorter than in early 2020 when it took some regions several weeks to reopen. ""There is risk that this might come back again and again and again,"" she said. ""If that's the case then it will have a lasting impact. But if it's just this month we wouldn't feel much pain.""  After suspending local operations Monday, Apple supplier Foxconn said Wednesday it had partially resumed production in Shenzhen at factory campuses that also include employee housing.  Shipping giant Maersk said Wednesday in an online customer advisory that terminals in major Greater China ports ""remain business as usual including vessel operation, yard handling and gate-in & out.""  However, the company noted that some depots for transporting goods through Shenzhen have been closed since Tuesday, while warehouses are closed for the week.  Covid testing requirements for truck drivers and stricter road control between Shenzhen and nearby cities means trucking services in the area will likely ""be severely impacted by 30%,"" Maersk said.  Analysis from Bank of America Securities earlier this week also found a muted impact from Covid on supply chains, including autos and semiconductors.  The supply chain shocks are relatively light so far, but the primary economic impact is on consumer spending and the services industry, said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance.  Not only is there an impact on services industries that rely on in-person and social gatherings, especially catering, Covid suppresses people's confidence and expectations for spending, he said. If they ""don't know when the pandemic will end, they won't dare to spend money, and will prudently save.""  He expects retail sales will rise by about 7% this year.  Consumer spending has remained sluggish since the pandemic began. Data for January and February released this week showed retail sales grew by 6.7% during those two months from the same period a year ago, a significant pickup from December and beating analysts' expectations.  Chinese authorities' initial reaction to new Covid cases has typically been to restrict travel as well as isolating and quarantining confirmed cases or contacts. Authorities restrict travel based on exposure to designated medium or high-risk districts, which can sometimes be as small as a single building or office park.  The mainland added three high-risk districts on Wednesday, for a total of 23, according to state media. That figure had fallen to zero as recently as Feb. 18, reports showed.  Consumption and any impact from Covid is just one aspect of China's economy, whose growth was already slowing before the latest wave of omicron cases. The massive real estate sector has struggled following Beijing's efforts to reduce developers' reliance on debt, while commodity prices have surged, especially after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.  Morgan Stanley says these Chinese stocks could rebound — Alibaba, Tencent aren't on the list  Wall Street banks name their favorite Asia stocks — and Citi says one could have upside of 167%  Xpeng and more: Morgan Stanley says these stocks will benefit from rising oil prices  ""Factories are also closing down for different reasons. It's not just Covid,"" Hang Seng China's Wang said, noting many had closed before the latest outbreak due to high raw material costs and price controls on end products like food and gas.  Rising production costs and inability to raise prices for consumers would cut into profits, or even eliminate them.  Tesla suspended production at its Shanghai factory on Wednesday and Thursday without giving a specific reason, Reuters reported, citing an internal document. The electric car company did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on the report.  This week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned in a tweet that ""Tesla & SpaceX are seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics.""  — CNBC's Sam Shead contributed to this report.

Property booming in ‘sanction free’ Dubai as Russian interest spikes ,2022-03-17 10:28:39+00:00,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Emirati property magnate Hussain Sajwani is riding high after a record start to the year for Dubai's property market.   ""Dubai is doing very well,"" the veteran real estate developer told CNBC on Wednesday. ""The way Dubai handled Covid was a key factor in booming the market now.""  Dubai saw $35 billion worth of property market transactions in 2021, the highest recorded since the global financial crisis, according to real estate firm Savills. A separate report from CBRE said total transaction volumes are now tracking at the highest level ever recorded for the first two months of this year.   Sajwani said the United Arab Emirates, which has long been a popular destination for Russian wealth and tourism, would stand to benefit as Russians seek refuge in the UAE and a safe haven for their fortunes amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and unprecedented Western sanctions.  ""I'm sure a lot of Russians are trying to fix their problems and their issues, but Dubai will benefit ultimately from any crisis,"" he said. It comes after the UAE, which has deepening ties with Russia, decided not to match sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.   ""I'll be honest with you, these sanctions… they made a lot of people nervous,"" Sajwani said. ""If anyone brings money through the banking system here legally and professionally, we'll do business with them.""  Russians were among the top purchasers of real estate before the war and sanctions, according to a recent Reuters report, which also said Russians were buying property in Dubai and even using crypto as a way of getting their money into the Gulf state.   The country's property market has also allegedly been a common channel for money laundering, experts have said, where individuals avoiding sanctions or seeking to park illicitly obtained wealth have been able to funnel their cash.  The UAE was put on a financial crime watchdog's ""gray list"" earlier this month over concerns that the Gulf country isn't sufficiently stemming illegal financial activities. Concerns over money laundering and illicit financial flows spurred the Financial Action Task Force, which was set up by the Group of 7 economies, put the UAE on a monitoring list alongside Turkey, Jordan, Pakistan and others.  In response to the designation, the UAE said it takes its role in protecting financial integrity ""extremely seriously and will work closely with the FATF to quickly remedy the areas of improvement identified.""  Sajwani said progress on the Iran nuclear deal would also be a tailwind. ""If the Iranian-American peace treaty, nuclear treaty, happens and takes place, it will be a big benefit for Dubai,"" he said. ""It will see much more stability and peace in the region,"" he added.  Dubai's property market reversed multiple years of price declines last year as the city shunned lockdowns, ramped up vaccinations and enacted new policies to draw in tourists and residents while the pandemic shut down the rest of the world.   The long-awaited Dubai Expo 2020, delayed for a year due to the pandemic, also helped pull in interest as the multi-billion dollar project aims to become a new residential and commercial complex after the event ends in April. Whether Expo will become the new thriving city within a city its developers have planned, however, is still yet to be seen.  ""Dubai's residential market has been the poster child of the rebound in real estate demand in 2021,"" Savills said. ""The city's residential market not just outperformed its past activity levels but was among the best-performing markets globally.""   "
"Berkshire Hathaway closes at a record above $500,000 a share as Buffett's conglomerate roars back",2022-03-17 00:25:33+00:00,"Berkshire Hathaway class A shares achieved a key milestone Wednesday, hitting an all-time closing high of half a million dollars as Warren Buffett's multifaceted conglomerate fires on all cylinders during the economic recovery.  The class A shares gained 1.3% Wednesday, rising for a fourth straight day to close at $504,400 — its first-ever close above the half-million dollar threshold. Shares of the Omaha-based company have rallied more than 11% this year, significantly outperforming the broader market.  ""I think a rotation into value names, coupled with Berkshire's exposure to the energy and utility space ... and investors' enthusiasm for Berkshire's aggressive share buybacks drove the shares' performance,"" said Cathy Seifert, a Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research.  The rally in the stock pushed Berkshire's market cap above $730 billion, surpassing tech pioneer Meta Platforms in market value and becoming only non-tech companies on the list of 10 most valuable U.S. public companies.  Berkshire's Class A shares are the conglomerate's original offering, which rapidly ballooned over time in price to eventually become one of the most expensive single stocks on Wall Street. Buffett has said he will never split the Class A shares because he believes the high share price will keep and attract more long-term, quality-oriented investors.  Still, in response to demand for a cheaper option among small investors, Berkshire issued convertible Class B shares in 1996 for one thirtieth of Class A share price initially. The affordable share class allows investors to purchase a piece of the company directly instead of buying a fraction of a share through unit trusts or mutual funds.  Berkshire's Class B shares closed at $336.11 apiece on Wednesday, rising a similar 12% this year.  Forget Tesla — this auto stock is the one to buy right now, analyst says  Josh Brown says Nvidia's potential is 'scary' ahead of a potential AI boom  Bill Miller says there are many good opportunities in the market. Here is where he’s looking  The company's operating earnings — which encompass profits made from the myriad of businesses owned by the conglomerate like insurance, railroads and utilities — jumped 45% from a year ago in the fourth quarter as businesses continued to roar back to life from the pandemic economic slowdown.  A slew of Buffett's stock holdings are also paying off handsomely, from Apple to big banks and Japanese trading houses. The 91-year-old investing legend's massive bet on Apple, which makes up 40% of Berkshire's equity portfolio, has made more than $120 billion on paper.  Meanwhile, Berkshire has further supported the stock by repurchasing a record $27 billion of its own shares in 2021 as the ""Oracle of Omaha"" found few opportunities externally. The conglomerate hasn't pulled off any big acquisitions in recent years so has consistently bought back its own shares with its massive cash pile. "
Russia ramps up internet censorship amid Ukraine war,2022-03-17 02:39:38+00:00,"As Russia's war on Ukraine continues, Moscow has looked to tighten control over its domestic internet, cutting off apps made by U.S. technology giants, even while other firms have pulled their own services from the country.  But a move to emulate the internet as it exists in China — perhaps the most restricted online environment anywhere — is a long way off, and Russian citizens are still manage to bypass controls in the system, analysts told CNBC.  Over the last few years, companies like Facebook owner Meta, Google and Twitter have operated in an uneasy environment in Russia.  They have faced pressure from the government to remove content the Kremlin deems unfavorable. The Washington Post reported this month that Russian agents threatened to jail a Google executive unless the company removed an app that had drawn the ire of the President Vladimir Putin. And companies have lived under threat of their services being throttled.  While Russia's internet became progressively more controlled, citizens could still access those global services, making them gateways to information other than state-backed media or pro-Kremlin sources.  But the war with Ukraine has thrust American technology giants into the cross-hairs once more, as Putin's desire to further control information increases.  Instagram is now blocked in Russia after its parent company Meta allowed users in some countries to call for violence against Russia's president and military in the context of the Ukraine invasion. Facebook was blocked in Russia last week after it put restrictions on government-backed news outlets. Access to Twitter is heavily restricted.  Those incidents highlight how Big Tech companies have to balance their pursuit of a large market like Russia with increasing demands for censorship.  ""For Western tech companies, they made a strategic decision at the beginning of the conflict to support Ukraine. This puts them on a collision course with the Russian government,"" Abishur Prakash, co-founder of the Center for Innovating the Future, told CNBC. He added that companies like Meta are ""picking politics over profits.""  Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its media and internet watchdog Roskomnadzor did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.  Russia's tightening online grip has revived talk about a ""splinternet"" — the idea that two or more divergent internets will operate in increasingly separate online worlds.  Nowhere is that separation clearer than in China, where services from Google, Meta, Twitter and foreign news organizations are blocked.  Instead of WhatsApp, Chinese citizens use WeChat, the popular messaging app with over 1 billion users, for example. Google search is replaced by Baidu. Weibo replaces Twitter.  The country's massive censorship system, known as the Great Firewall, has developed over two decades and is continually being refined.  Even virtual private networks, services that can mask users' locations and identities in order to help them jump the firewall, are hard to get for regular Chinese citizens.  While Russia's increasing internet controls will likely accelerate this push toward divergent internets, the country is far off from creating anything near the technical capability behind China's restrictions.  ""It's taken years for the Chinese authorities to get where they are today. And their strategy has evolved and adapted during this time. Russia cannot do this overnight,"" said Charlie Smith, founder of GreatFire.org, an organization that monitors censorship in China.  Paul Triolo, senior vice president for China and technology policy lead at strategic advisory firm Albright Stonebridge Group, said that China's system allows ""internet censors and internet controllers much more granular leeway to monitoring traffic, turn off geographical areas, including down to the block level in cities, and be very precise in their targeting of offending traffic or users.""  That is something Russia cannot replicate, he added.  It is difficult for Chinese citizens to get around Beijing's tight internet controls. The government has regularly clamped down on VPN apps, which are the best option for evading the Great Firewall.  But Russians have been able to evade the Kremlin's attempts to censor the internet. VPNs have seen a surge in downloads from Russia.  Meanwhile, Twitter has launched a version of its website on Tor, a service that encrypts internet traffic to help mask the identity of users and prevent surveillance on them.  ""Putin appears to have misjudged both the level of technical savvy of his citizens and their willingness to seek workarounds to continue to access non-official information, and the many new tools and services, plus workarounds and channels that have sprung up over the past five years that enable people who really want to maintain access to outside information channels to do so,"" Albright Stonebridge Group's Triolo said.  As U.S. and European firms suspend business in Russia, Chinese technology companies could look to take advantage of that. Many of them, from Alibaba to smartphone maker Realme, already have business there.  So far, Chinese companies have remained silent on the issue of the Russia-Ukraine war.  Beijing has refused to call Russia's war on Ukraine an ""invasion"" and has not joined the United States, European Union, Japan and others' sanctions against Moscow.  It's therefore a tricky path for Chinese corporates.  ""So far there does not seem to be any guidance coming from central authorities in China on how companies should deal with the sanctions or export controls, so companies with a large footprint outside China are likely to be reluctant to buck restrictions,"" Triolo said.  ""They will be very careful in determining both Beijing's wishes here, weighing how to handle demands from Russia customers old and new, and gauging the risks to their broader operations of continuing to cooperate with sanctioned end user organizations.""  The Chinese are likely to make their moves depending on the tone from Beijing, according to Prakash.  ""If Beijing continues to tacitly support Moscow, then Chinese tech firms have several opportunities. The biggest opportunity is for these companies to fill the gap that Western companies created when they exited Russia,"" he said. ""The ability of these companies to grow their footprint and revenue in Russia is massive."" "

Google-backed start-up launches free carbon emissions tracker,2022-03-21 10:04:28+00:00,"Normative, a Swedish start-up backed by Google, has launched a free version of its carbon emissions tracker as companies around the world try to figure out how to manage their environmental footprints.  The carbon calculator is designed to provide small- to medium-sized businesses with a ""baseline"" from which they can take action after they put some data into a form. Normative also has a paid-for product that it sells to large businesses.  Though the burning of fossil fuels is the chief driver of the climate crisis, the world is set to become even more dependent on energy sources such as oil and gas in the coming decades. That comes even as world leaders and CEOs repeatedly tout their commitment to the so-called ""energy transition.""  SMEs account for 95% of businesses globally, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Many of them play interconnected roles in the creation of the products and services of large corporations.  Kristian Ronn, CEO and co-founder of Normative, told CNBC Thursday the world economy is more interconnected than ever before.  ""That means that if you take an average business, 90% of their emissions will be in the value chain,"" Ronn said, adding that SMEs make up a large chunk of the value chain. ""In order to actually move the needle on climate change, large enterprises and small enterprises need to work together.""  Ronn said Normative launched the free tool for SMEs to help them report on their emissions and to make it easy for large enterprises to get real emissions data from their value chain.  Google itself is yet to sign up as a customer but Ronn said they're having conversations.  Matt Brittin, president of EMEA business and operations at Google, told CNBC on Thursday that he couldn't comment on why Google hadn't signed up as a customer as he wasn't personally responsible for brokering such deals. ""I'm sure Kristian's driving a hard bargain with us,"" he said.  Around a dozen fellows from Google.org, Google's philanthropic arm, helped to build the free carbon calculator, with software engineers, UX designers, and product managers all supporting Normative on a full-time, pro bono basis for six months.  The search giant's support comes after Google backed the company with 1 million euros ($1.1 million) last year through Google.org.  Jen Carter, head of technology and volunteering at Google.org, told CNBC in October that measuring carbon emissions accurately is essential if small businesses want to understand the impact of their actions. ""We're thrilled to provide both funding and tech talent to help Normative build a solution that will make measurement more accessible,"" she said.  Brittin said he was pleased to see so many ""genuine and serious"" big businesses at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow last year.  ""We hope to lead the way but we're humble enough to realize that we can learn from lots of other people,"" he said.  Normative was founded in 2014 and it's been backed by billionaire investor Chris Sacca's Lowercarbon Capital, among others. It charges hundreds of firms, including French bank BNP Paribas, for access to its existing software, with rates depending on the size of the customer.  Tech giants have long strived to be seen as the greenest companies on the planet.  Google has been carbon-neutral since 2007, meaning it has planted trees, bought carbon credits and funded large amounts of wind power in places where it is abundant in order to offset its tapping of coal and natural gas power in other regions.  In September 2020, Google said it was aiming to power its data centers and offices 24/7 using only carbon-free electricity by 2030. Wind, solar and other renewable sources accounted for just 61% of Google's global hourly electricity usage in 2019.  ""We'll want to select suppliers who know what their footprint is,"" Brittin said. ""This kind of tool (from Normative) is going to help those suppliers compete for business.""

Covid resurgence in China: why oil prices are down from record highs,2022-03-16 07:48:52+00:00,"China's recent Covid wave and subsequent lockdowns have helped oil prices ease from record highs reached roughly a week ago, according to analysts.  ""We have the re-emergence of Covid in China, which is throwing another spanner into the works when we're trying to assess what the demand will be,"" said Richard Gorry, managing director of JBC Energy Asia.  He also said markets are still grappling with the disruption of oil supply caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.  Oil prices have been volatile in recent sessions, spiking to record levels not seen since 2008 just a week ago, reaching above $130 per barrel. But crude prices then fell drastically, dropping more than 27% below that recent high to less than $100 a barrel earlier this week.  ""The OPEC in their monthly reports have not changed their demand forecast, which suggests that it is business as normal,"" Gorry said. ""I would tend to believe that that will probably change in the months ahead, because if we look at China, for example, right now, we have 45 million people under lockdown, like it was in 2020. And we know from history that this does have an impact on oil demand.""  In the last few days, China has clamped down as it grapples with its worst Covid spike since the pandemic began, ordering lockdowns and a pause in manufacturing in some cities. Manufacturing hub Shenzhen ordered businesses to suspend production, which affected companies like Apple supplier Foxconn.  China is the world's biggest oil importer and any reduction in demand would have an impact on energy prices.  While ""it's tempting to attribute the fall-back in oil to optimism towards an early cessation of hostilities in Ukraine,"" it's more likely a combination of reasons, according to Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank.  ""[The fall in oil prices] more likely reflects a combination of some speculative froth being blown off, alongside fears of weaker China demand as more Chinese cities are put into lockdown amid record high Covid case numbers — as tiny as these are relative to most other parts of the world,"" he wrote in a Wednesday note.  Recent outbreaks have infected more than 15,000 people and stem primarily from the highly transmissible omicron variant, China's National Health Commission said Tuesday, according to state media.  Furthermore, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov indicated Moscow would allow the Iran nuclear deal to go ahead, which would lead to the resumption of oil supply. Talks to revive the deal were previously stalled by demands made by Russia, one of the core participants of the deal, according to Reuters.  ""There are hopes a nuclear deal with Iran may soon be concluded, which may bring some stability to the Middle East and shore up oil supplies,"" said ANZ Research analysts Brian Martin and Daniel Hynes.  Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group, however was less optimistic.  ""The Shenzhen lockdowns and Lavrov saying that Russia could live with the Iran nuclear deal, and there's talk of a deal between Ukraine and Russia. So I understand why we took out all the risk, but I don't think it's over yet,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Wednesday.  ""So I'm afraid we probably have to go higher before we go much lower,"" he said, of oil prices.  — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report. "
UAE property tycoon Sajwani makes $1 billion bet on data centers ,2022-03-17 10:25:08+00:00,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Emirati property magnate Hussain Sajwani will invest $1 billion to build a global network of data centers under his recently launched Edgnex venture, marking a pivot to digital after two decades in brick and mortar real estate.   ""We're going to build data centers in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East,"" Sajwani told CNBC on Wednesday. ""We want to build a global company, and we're allocating a billion dollars for that business, and we're going global to put our footprint in all those four continents,"" he added.  Sajwani, who founded Damac Properties in the early 2000s and made a fortune building apartments, hotels and golf courses in and around Dubai, said data centers were a natural progression for his business as the pandemic accelerates a shift to digital work and play.  ""We have the cash to inject, we've hired a very good team… and we think we can build them at a more reasonable cost than our competitors,"" Sajwani said. Edgnex, the new wholly owned data center venture of which he is founder and chairman, has already earmarked five plots to develop data centers, including three in Saudi Arabia, two in Turkey and one in Ireland.   It comes as demand for data center infrastructure has grown through the pandemic, attracting interest from traditional commercial real estate developers and investors as a way to diversify their interests. Recent years have seen major tech firms expand into the Middle East in the data center and cloud computing space as commerce and investment in the region grows.  Cloud computing giant Amazon Web Services (AWS) is set to expand into the UAE, opening an ""infrastructure region"" in the country in the first half of 2022 after its first foray into the Gulf, an AWS availability zone in Bahrain. In 2019, Microsoft launched its first Middle East data centers in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  ""We're not going to build the racks, we're leasing the space,"" Sajwani said. Edgnex will target ""hyperscalers"" such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft to lease its facilities for use in emerging or underserved markets around the world.  ""The next step is co-location. If we build 20 megawatts, a ""hyperscaler"" can take 15, and the other five we can lease to banks and large institutions,"" he said. Edgnex also plans to roll out smaller edge data centers in the coming years, targeting a market expected to be worth $13.5 billion by 2024, according to a recent study by PWC. "
China targeted dad of Olympic figure skater Alysa Liu: DOJ ,2022-03-16 16:51:51+00:00,"The Justice Department will accuse Chinese government agents of waging campaigns to intimidate critics living in the United States, among them the dad of an Olympic figure skater, in new criminal charges expected to be formally announced Wednesday, NBC News reported.  The Justice Department has scheduled a 2 p.m. press conference to detail the allegations and charges.  NBC News, citing officials familiar with the case, reported that there were three separate alleged efforts by Chinese government agents targeting critics in the U.S.  Among them was Arthur Liu — the father of Olympic figure skater Alysa Liu — who is a lawyer and political activist in the San Francisco Bay area. Alysa Liu, 16, a two-time U.S. champion, competed for the American team in the Winter Games in Beijing.   When he lived in China, Arthur Liu helped organize pro-democracy demonstrations there, according to NBC.  A second target for intimidation was an unidentified Democratic candidate for Congress on Long Island in New York. The candidate's name is not revealed in court documents.  That candidate appears to be Xiong Yan, a retired U.S. Army chaplain who was involved in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing.  Yan is seeking the Democratic nomination for New York's 1st District seat in the House of Representatives this year.  This is breaking news. Check back for updates. "

What has Anonymous done to Russia? Here are the results ,2022-03-16 06:04:43+00:00,"More than three weeks ago, a popular Twitter account named ""Anonymous"" declared that the shadowy activist group was waging a ""cyber war"" against Russia.  Since then, the account — which has more than 7.9 million followers, with some 500,000 gained since Russia's invasion of Ukraine — has claimed responsibility for disabling prominent Russian government, news and corporate websites and leaking data from entities such as Roskomnadzor, the federal agency responsible for censoring Russian media.  But is any of that true?  It appears it is, says Jeremiah Fowler, a co-founder of the cybersecurity company Security Discovery, who worked with researchers at the web company Website Planet to attempt to verify the group's claims.  ""Anonymous has proven to be a very capable group that has penetrated some high value targets, records and databases in the Russian Federation,"" he wrote in a report summarizing the findings.    Of 100 Russian databases that were analyzed, 92 had been compromised, said Fowler.  They belonged to retailers, Russian internet providers and intergovernmental websites, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, an organization made up of Russia and other former Soviet nations that was created in 1991 following the fall of the Soviet Union.  Many CIS files were erased, hundreds of folders were renamed to ""putin_stop_this_war"" and email addresses and administrative credentials were exposed, said Fowler, who likened it to 2020's malicious ""MeowBot"" attacks, which ""had no purpose except for a malicious script that wiped out data and renamed all the files.""  Another hacked database contained more than 270,000 names and email addresses.  ""We know for a fact that hackers found and probably accessed these systems,"" said Fowler. ""We do not know if data was downloaded or what the hackers plan to do with this information.""  Other databases contained security information, internal passwords and a ""very large number"" of secret keys, which unlock encrypted data, said Fowler.  As to whether this was the work of Anonymous, Fowler said he followed Anonymous' claims ""and the timeline matches perfect,"" he said.  The Twitter account, named @YourAnonNews, has also claimed to have hacked into Russian state TV stations.  ""I would mark that as true if I were a factchecker,"" said Fowler. ""My partner at Security Discovery, Bob Diachenko, actually captured a state news live feed from a website and filmed the screen, so we were able to validate that they had hacked at least one live feed [with] a pro-Ukrainian message in Russian.""  The account has also claimed to have disrupted websites of major Russian organizations and media agencies, such as the energy company Gazprom and state-sponsored news agency RT.  ""Many of these agencies have admitted that they were attacked,"" said Fowler.  He called denial of service attacks — which aim to disable websites by flooding them with traffic — ""super easy."" Those websites, and many others, have been shuttered at various points in recent weeks, but they are also reportedly being targeted by other groups as well, including some 310,000 digital volunteers who have signed up for the ""IT Army of Ukraine"" Telegram account.     Fowler said he didn't find any instances where Anonymous had overstated its claims.  But that is happening with other hacktivist groups, said Lotem Finkelstein, head of threat intelligence and research at the cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies.  In recent weeks, a pro-Ukrainian group claimed it breached a Russian nuclear reactor, and a pro-Russian group said it shut down Anonymous' website. Check Point concluded both claims were false.  ""As there is no real official Anonymous website, this attack … appears to be more of a morale booster for the pro-Russian side, and a publicity event,"" CPR said, a fact which did not go unnoticed by Anonymous affiliates, who mocked the claim on social media.   Groups are making fake claims by posting old or publicly available information to gain popularity or glory, said Finkelstein.  Fowler said he feels Anonymous is, however, dedicated more to the ""cause"" than to notoriety.  ""In what I saw in these databases, it was more about the messaging than saying 'hey, you know, Anonymous troop No. 21, group five, did this,'"" he said. ""It was more about the end result.""  Hacktivists who conduct offensive cyber warfare-like activities without government authority are engaging in criminal acts, said Paul de Souza, the founder of the non-profit Cyber Security Forum Initiative.  Despite this, many social media users are cheering Anonymous' efforts on, with many posts receiving thousands of likes and messages of support.  ""They're almost like a cyber Robin Hood, when it comes to causes that people really care about, that no one else can really do anything about,"" said Fowler. ""You want action now, you want justice now, and I think groups like Anonymous and hacktivists give people that immediate satisfaction.""  Many hacktivist groups have strong values, said Marianne Bailey, a cybersecurity partner at the consulting firm Guidehouse and former cybersecurity executive with the U.S. National Security Agency. Cyber activism is a low-cost way for them to influence governmental and corporate actions, she said.  ""It is protesting in the 21st century,"" said Bailey.    Yet cheering them on can be dangerous in the ""fog of war,"" she said.  ""A cyberattack has the potential for such an immediate impact, in most cases well before any accurate attribution can be determined,"" she said. ""A cyber strike back or even kinetic strike back could be directed to the wrong place. And what if that misattribution is intentional? What if someone makes the attack appear from a specific country when that's not true?""  She said cyber warfare can be cheaper, easier, more effective and easier to deny than traditional military warfare, and that it will only increase with time.  ""With more devices connected to this global digital ecosystem the opportunity for impact continues to expand,"" she said. ""It will undoubtedly be used more often in future conflicts."" "
"Russia-Ukraine war updates for Weds, March 16",2022-03-17 09:53:24+00:00,"This has been CNBC's live blog covering updates on the war in Ukraine. [Follow the latest updates here.]  Residential buildings in the Ukrainian capital have come under fire again on Wednesday, with Russian shelling attacks leading to the partial collapse of an apartment block, authorities have said.  The fresh bombing of homes in Kyiv comes ahead of more negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian participant in the talks, said Tuesday that although the process was ""difficult,"" there was ""definitely room for compromise.""  U.S. lawmakers gave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy several standing ovations in his address to Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said ""glory to heroes"" in Ukrainian in introducing the war-weary president, according to an English interpretation of her remarks.  Russian forces have made ""minimal"" progress in their invasion of Ukraine in recent days and continue to suffer heavy losses, the U.K. Ministry of Defence said Thursday.  ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has largely stalled on all fronts,"" including land, sea and air, the ministry said in a intelligence update.  Ukrainian resistance remains stubborn and well coordinated, the ministry said, with all major Ukrainian cities and most territory still in Ukrainian hands.  In response to a request for comment, Russia's Defense Ministry directed CNBC to an English-language statement from March 1 which said in part that its armed forces ""will continue [the] special operation in Ukraine until complete of all objectives.""  — Ted Kemp  Russian forces attacking Ukraine are likely turning to less precise heavy weapons that are less effective from a military standpoint and more likely to kill civilians, a European government said.  The U.K. Defence Ministry said late Wednesday local time that Russia has expended more of its ""stand-off air launched weapons"" than it had expected, because it has failed to achieve its objectives or to gain control of Ukrainian airspace.  ""Stand-off"" weaponry refers to missiles that Russian aircraft can fire from a long distance without exposing themselves to Ukrainian anti-aircraft weapons. Ukraine's anti-aircraft capabilities are still active and taking down Russian helicopters and jets.  ""As a result, it is likely Russia is resorting to the use of older, less precise weapons, which are less militarily effective and more likely to result in civilian casualties,"" the ministry said in an intelligence update.  In response to a request for comment, the Russian Ministry of Defense directed CNBC to a statement from more than two weeks ago which said in part that Russian forces carry out strikes only on military targets ""using high-precision weapons.""  However, overwhelming photographic and video evidence, as well as official assessments from the United States, United Kingdom and others, show that Russia is in fact striking civilian targets with unguided weapons.  Weapons like rockets, ""dumb"" unguided bombs, and long-range artillery are less accurate and therefore more likely to hit unintended targets.  According to the most recent confirmed UN figures, more than 700 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the invasion began, but the actual number is likely to be much higher.  Death tolls from cities under artillery bombardment, such as Kharkiv and Mariupol, are unknown.  — Ted Kemp  Empty shelves, closed restaurants and retail chains are becoming part of everyday life in Russia as Western economic sanctions take hold.  —Adam Jeffery  Pope Francis and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill hold a video conference to discuss the situation in Ukraine on March 16.   —Adam Jeffery  The International Court of Justice ruled in favor of Ukraine and ordered Russia to immediately suspend its ongoing war.  In its ruling the court wrote:  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter that the United Nations' top court handed a ""complete victory"" in its case against Russia.  ""The order is binding under international law. Russia must comply immediately. Ignoring the order will isolate Russia even further,"" Zelenskyy added.  Russia has previously snubbed the International Court of Justice hearings on the matter.  — Amanda Macias  A senior U.S. Defense official said Russian forces have not made significant progress in the ongoing 21-day war in Ukraine.  ""They have not made a lot of progress on the ground,"" the official said, adding that Russian forces are plagued by logistics and supply issues and are facing a tough resistance by Ukrainian fighters.  ""Let's not forget that they [the Russians] still have an awful lot of combat capability available to them,"" the official said adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin has dedicated approximately 75% of his total military to the fight in Ukraine.  The official added that Russian troops remain largely stalled in their advance on Kyiv.  — Amanda Macias  The Pentagon has seen an increased tempo in shelling on Ukrainian cities near the Black Sea, a senior U.S. Defense official said on a call with reporters.  ""We have observed on our own the shelling of some cities, some towns near Odesa, but not in Odesa,"" explained the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to share new details from U.S. military reports.  The official said the missiles are believed to be coming from Russian warships located in the Black Sea.  ""I really don't want to speculate but it could be that they're simply preparing the way to make it easier for some sort of ground assault on Odesa,"" the official said, cautioning that the Pentagon does not have a full view of the Kremlin's war plans.  Russian forces have launched more than 980 missiles into Ukraine since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the official.  — Amanda Macias  President Joe Biden called Russian leader Vladimir Putin ""a war criminal"" for his attacks on Ukraine.  It appears to be the first time that Biden has publicly branded Putin with that phrase.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki later said Biden was speaking from his heart and from what he's seen on the news, which are ""barbaric actions by a brutal dictator.""  She noted that there's a separate legal process to determine whether Putin has violated international law and committed war crimes, which is currently underway at the State Department.     — Dan Mangan  NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""immediately"" stop the war in Ukraine, adding that Russia's efforts to undermine the alliance had failed.  ""President Putin must stop this war immediately [and] engage in diplomacy in good faith,"" Stoltenberg said at an extraordinary meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Belgium.  The military alliance had agreed to double down on its support for Ukraine, providing further military supplies, financial help and humanitarian aid, he said.  Stoltenberg added that member states would expand their defenses across land, air, sea and space in response to the ""new reality for our security,"" applauding recent finance commitments from Germany and Denmark.  ""President Putin's aim was to undermine NATO. What he's done is to strengthen NATO ... He's getting more NATO on its borders,"" he said.  Here's what's in the colossal $800 million U.S. military arms package President Joe Biden approved for Ukraine:  — Amanda Macias  Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""willing to commit war crimes right out in public,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren told CNBC, as she reflected on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to Congress earlier in the day.  ""We want to help Ukraine in every way possible that will be helpful to Ukraine,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said in an interview on ""The Exchange.""  When asked specifically about Zelenskyy's calls for a no-fly zone, Warren said it's important the U.S. stays on the same page with its European allies on how to best lend support.  ""Where everyone is right now is giving lots and lots of military and humanitarian aid to help support the Ukrainians but not going into direct conflict,"" she said.  — Kevin Stankiewicz  U.S. President Joe Biden condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine as an ""outrage to the world,"" just before sending $800 million in military and humanitarian support to the war-torn nation.  ""This is a struggle that pits the appetites of an autocrat against humankind's desire to be free,"" Biden said of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""And let there be no doubt, no uncertainty, no question — America stands with the forces of freedom. We always have, we always will.""  The funds will go toward 800 anti-aircraft systems, 9,000 anti-armor systems, 7,000 small-arm machine guns, as well as grenade launchers and shotguns.  Biden said Putin was inflicting ""appalling devastation."" He cited reports of Russian forces holding hundreds of doctors and patients hostage at a hospital in Mariupol.  ""These atrocities are an outrage to the world,"" Biden said.  — Dawn Kopecki  Concerts were held at Rynok Square and Svobody street by Lviv Symphony Orchestra and Mikola Lisenko Music Academy.   — Adam Jeffery  NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""immediately"" stop the war in Ukraine, adding that Russia's efforts to undermine the alliance had failed.

""President Putin's aim was to undermine NATO. What he's done is to strengthen NATO ... He's getting more NATO on its borders,"" he said.  The U.S. House will vote on revoking Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status soon, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said.   The Democrat from Maryland said lawmakers ""are working very hard on getting agreement"" on legislation that would end normal trade relations with Moscow. Taking the step would allow the U.S. to impose punishing tariffs on Russian goods.   ""There is no doubt that there is consensus in the Congress that we want to remove permanent normal trading relations with Russians,"" Hoyer said, adding that the House could vote this week if lawmakers reach a deal.  Both the House and Senate would have to pass a bill to remove Russia's most favored nation status.   — Jacob Pramuk  International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova to discuss the Kremlin's war.  ""Grateful to Ukrainian authorities for receiving me in incredibly challenging circumstances. Pursuit of #justice requires us to work together,"" the Hague wrote on Twitter.  Khan also met virtually with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of war crimes after repeated reports of Russian strikes killing civilians.  — Amanda Macias  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Attorney General Merrick Garland  met virtually with their counterparts from Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Commission to launch their multilateral task force to track down the assets of Russian oligarchs.  The Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs task force, or REPO, was created last month to coordinate an international effort to enforce sanctions imposed against Russia, its President Vladimir Putin, his allies and their families.   In the last three weeks, the group has seized multiple yachts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the Treasury. The group discussed the need to preserve evidence and whether frozen assets should be subject to forfeiture. The Justice Department set up Task Force KleptoCapture earlier this month to aid in the hunt.   — Dawn Kopecki  Russian President Vladimir Putin said the West would not succeed in what he called its attempt to achieve global dominance and dismember Russia.  If the West thought that Russia would step back, it did not understand Russia, Putin said on the 21st day of the war against Ukraine.  ""Behind the hypocritical talk and today's actions of the so-called collective West are hostile geopolitical goals. They just don't want a strong and sovereign Russia,"" Putin said.  He said Russia was ready to discuss Ukraine's neutral status in talks aimed at ending hostilities, but it would still meet the objectives of its military operation, which was ""going to plan."" In remarks to government ministers that were broadcast on state television, Putin said the West would only strengthen Russia with its hostile actions.  — Reuters  U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned Russian Security Council Secretary Gen. Nikolai Patrushev of the consequences should Moscow decide to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.  The warning follows claims by Russian officials that the United States is working on secret biological weapons in Ukraine. The United States, Ukraine and western allies have denied the claim.  Biden's top security adviser also reiterated U.S. ""commitment to continue imposing costs on Russia, to support the defense of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to reinforce NATO's eastern flank, in continued full coordination with our allies and partners,"" the White House wrote in a readout of the call.  — Amanda Macias  Zelenskyy invoked the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Sept. 11 terror strikes on America on Wednesday as he pleaded with the U.S. Congress for more aid for his embattled country to fight against its invasion by Russia.  The Ukrainian president, who was greeted with three standing ovations from an audience of lawmakers, asked the U.S. to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stem the Russian attacks, additional weapons, sanctions and humanitarian support.  He also urged members of Congress to get companies in their legislative districts to leave the Russian market ""because it is flooded with our blood.""  Zelenskyy was introduced for his address, which was delivered remotely from the Ukraine capitol Kyiv, by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  — Dan Mangan  Russian forces are ""struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine's terrain,"" the U.K.'s Ministry of Defense said Wednesday.  ""Russian forces have remained largely tied to Ukraine's road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road maneuver,"" the ministry said in an intelligence update. ""The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia's advance.""  British officials added that Russia's continued failure to gain control of the skies had ""drastically limited their ability to effectively use air maneuver, further limiting their options.""  ""The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia's lack of maneuver, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces.""  — Chloe Taylor  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on world leaders to ""cut all ties"" with Russia on Wednesday.  — Chloe Taylor  Moscow has hinted that its objectives in talks with Ukraine could include seeing Ukraine become a so-called neutral state like Sweden.  ""The Russian Federation believes that the Swedish version of a neutral state in Ukraine can be seen as a compromise,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday.  He added that Western sanctions on Russian big business could ""only be called banditry at the state level.""  ""Personal sanctions of Russia against the leaders of unfriendly countries will follow,"" he said, but he noted that Moscow's imposition of sanctions on U.S. President Joe Biden this week ""does not mean a rejection of contact.""  — Chloe Taylor  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will address Congress in hopes of getting more aid as Kyiv and other key cities come under heavy fire from Russia.  An early projection released by the U.N. Development Program Wednesday said 90% of the Ukrainian population could face poverty and ""extreme economic vulnerability"" if the war deepens.  This would ""set the country – and the region – back decades and leave deep social and economic scars for generations to come,"" the UNDP warned.  The organization found that in the event of a continuing war, 18 years of socio-economic achievements could be lost, with almost one in three people living below the poverty line and a further 62% at high risk of falling into poverty within a year.  ""While the need for immediate humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians is of the utmost importance, the acute development impacts of a protracted war are now becoming more apparent,"" UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said in a press release.  ""An alarming economic decline, and the suffering and hardship it will bring to an already traumatized population must now come into sharper focus. There is still time to halt this grim trajectory.""  — Chloe Taylor  The International Chess Federation said Wednesday that the national teams of Russia and Belarus were suspended from participating in its tournaments until further notice.  — Chloe Taylor  A team working for the International Criminal Court is working in Ukraine to collect evidence of war crimes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address on Wednesday.  ""We are doing everything to bring occupiers to justice,"" he said. ""There will be an international tribunal for all they did against Ukraine and our people for every act of terror by the Russian troops on the territory of our country.""  He added that Ukraine's prosecutor general was also working on this.  Zelenskyy said that Moscow's forces had continued to shell peaceful Ukrainian citizens overnight, but said the number of Russian troops killed in the conflict was approaching 14,000. CNBC has not been able to independently verify this figure.  A total of 103 children had been killed so far in the war, Zelenskyy said.  — Chloe Taylor  Switzerland has announced further sanctions on Russia in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.  Guy Parmelin, head of Switzerland's Federal Department of Economic Affairs, approved the sanctioning of more than 200 individuals and entities connected to what the Swiss government called ""serious violations of international law by Russia in Ukraine.""  The move meant Switzerland's sanctions list now ""fully mirrors that of the EU,"" the government said in a statement on Wednesday.  ""A further 197 individuals are now subject to financial sanctions and travel restrictions and 9 additional entities are now subject to financial sanctions,"" the government said. ""Among those individuals are further oligarchs and prominent businesspeople. Assets in Switzerland belonging to these individuals must be frozen and reported to the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs.""  The sanctions came into force on Wednesday at midday local time.  — Chloe Taylor  Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, more than 500 civilians have been killed in the conflict in Kharkiv alone, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said on Wednesday.  CNBC has not been able to independently verify the figures.  Kharkiv is Ukraine's second-largest city. Two people were reportedly killed when airstrikes hit apartment buildings in Kharkiv early this morning.  — Chloe Taylor  Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin arrived at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, for a two-day meeting of defense ministers.  During his brief opening remarks, Austin reiterated U.S. commitment to Article 5 of the alliance's founding treaty.  A cornerstone of the 30-member alliance is the principle of collective defense, known as Article 5, which states that an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all allies.  ""We believe that our commitment to NATO, our Article Five commitment is ironclad. You can expect that, as the president has said a number of times that we will abide by that commitment,"" Austin said alongside Stoltenberg.  Austin's trip comes one week before President Joe Biden heads to NATO to attend a leaders' meeting.  — Amanda Macias  Estonian Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets has told CNBC that Ukraine's allies should consider imposing sanctions on China if Beijing does move to help Russia with its invasion of Ukraine.  Asked by CNBC's Silvia Amaro whether the West should respond with sanctions if China assisted Russia in the war, Liimets said: ""Yes, we should discuss it definitely.""  ""So far, we have seen that Belarus has helped Russia in this war, and from the European Union side we have also approved sanctions against Belarus because they are part of the conflict,"" she said. ""And of course, if other countries continue to support Russia's unjustified war in Ukraine, we have to consider these kind of actions.""  Reports emerged in recent days that Moscow had asked Beijing for military equipment to help with its invasion of Ukraine. Both countries vehemently denied those allegations.  — Chloe Taylor  Ukraine's capital Kyiv has been heavily fortified in anticipation of a largescale Russian attack but analysts fear the city could face the same scale of destruction that the Chechen capital Grozny, and Aleppo in Syria, experienced in recent conflicts.  Read the full story here.   — Holly Ellyatt  More than 3 million people have now fled the conflict in Ukraine, with more than half going to Poland.  In less than three weeks, the east European country has welcomed 1.85 million refugees — almost twice the 1 million authorities had anticipated and increasing its population by 4.8%.  As the number of refugees requiring humanitarian assistance spirals well beyond initial estimates, it is putting considerable strain on governments and the relief agencies, raising questions about what more the European Union will do to provide support.  So far, the EU has assigned 500 million euros ($547 million) for humanitarian aid. Yet estimates from the Economist Intelligence Unit suggest that the cost of supporting 5 million refugees could be 50 billion euros in 2022 alone.  Read the full story here.  — Karen Gilchrist  Japan is set to strip Russia of its ""most favored nation"" status, Japanese news agency Kyodo reported on Wednesday, paving the way for Tokyo to slap tariffs on imported Russian goods.  ""Most-favored nation"" status is a classification within the World Trade Organization that exempts a country from tariffs.  The U.S., the U.K., Canada and the EU have already unveiled plans to revoke Russia's MFN status.  Meanwhile, Reuters reported Wednesday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Japan would work with G-7 countries to prevent Russia from accessing IMF loans.  — Chloe Taylor  Officials in Bucha — a city just outside Kyiv — has said Russian forces have ransacked the city's main administrative building and have captured six hostages.  The hostages are made up of employees and volunteers, the city council said.  CNBC has not been able to independently verify the claims.  ""On Tuesday evening, March 15, the Russian occupiers ransacked the administrative building of the Bucha City Council and captured our staff and volunteers, who helped the residents of our city under fire,"" Bucha City Council said in a post on Telegram Wednesday morning.  The post called on the Ukrainian Presidential Office and Kyiv Regional State Administration to ""help release our people.""  — Chloe Taylor  A total of 21 people were killed in an airstrike on a television tower in the Ukrainian city of Rivne, local authorities have said.  In a briefing on Wednesday morning, Vitaliy Koval, head of the Rivne regional administration, confirmed that rescue work in the wake of the strike on Monday had been completed, and that 21 people had died in the attack while nine had been wounded.  — Chloe Taylor  Russian forces have targeted the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia for the first time since invading Ukraine, local authorities said Wednesday.  Oleksandr Starukh, head of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said in a statement that civilian infrastructure in the city had been attacked for the first time.  ""The morning was not good,"" he said, according to an NBC News translation. ""The main news is that for the first time in Zaporizhzhia, civilian objects have been bombed. The rockets landed in the area of the Zaporizhzhia-2 railway station. According to preliminary data, no one was killed.""  A second rocket had landed in the city's botanical gardens, Starukh added.  In recent days, Zaporizhzhia has been the government-designated destination for civilians fleeing the besieged city of Mariupol.  According to Starukh, Zaporizhzhia had received and resettled more than 3,000 people, including 772 children, as of 2 a.m. on Wednesday.  — Chloe Taylor  The United States may provide Ukraine with killer drones that fly directly into targets before detonating, NBC News reported Tuesday night, citing unnamed congressional officials.  ""Switchblade"" drones are made by U.S.-based AeroVironment and carry explosives. They come in two varieties, one designed for pinpoint strikes on personnel, and a bigger one for attacking tanks and armored vehicles.  The smaller, single-use Switchblade 300s cost only about $6,000 each, NBC News reported.  No decisions have been made on the drones, the report said, but U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to discuss the Switchblades on Wednesday as part of the next round of military aid to Ukraine.  NBC News first reported on the Switchblade 300 in December.  AeroVironment officials did not respond to requests for comment.  — Ted Kemp  Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Wednesday morning that Russian forces have seized a hospital in Mariupol, where they are holding 400 hostages.  She also said in a video address that Russian troops were firing from the hospital.  CNBC has not been able to independently verify or confirm the reports.  Vereshchuk added in her address on Wednesday that Ukraine had not received a response to its proposals to open humanitarian corridors today, but said officials were still open to discuss establishing evacuation corridors in the cities of Izyum and Mariupol. In the current circumstances, she said, authorities could not safely evacuate civilians.  Early attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol had to be halted because Ukrainian authorities said Russian forces had violated cease-fire agreements in the city.  Mariupol is crucial in the war for Ukraine, as its capture could help Russian forces create a land corridor to Crimea — a peninsula in the country's south that Moscow invaded and annexed in 2014.  — Chloe Taylor  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has signaled some optimism toward the ongoing talks between Russia and Ukraine.    ""In the talks between Russia and Ukraine, there is some hope of reaching a compromise,"" Lavrov said in a televised interview with Russia's RBC.  ""The neutral status of Ukraine is now being seriously discussed in the negotiations in conjunction with other security issues. There are already specific formulations that are close to being agreed upon.""  Lavrov added that Russia's so-called special operation in Ukraine was ""not so much about Ukraine, but about the world order.""  ""The United States under Biden subjugated Europe, and the current crisis is an epochal moment in defining the world order,"" he said.  Talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials are scheduled to resume today following continued negotiations on Tuesday.  — Chloe Taylor  NATO defense ministers are meeting in Brussels today to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine.  Speaking ahead of the meeting, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance would ""of course address the brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russia.""  ""This is devastating for the Ukrainian people, and it will also change our security environment,"" he told reporters. ""It will have long-lasting consequences for our security for all NATO allies.""  He noted that hundreds of thousands of troops were already on ""heightened alert,"" with 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe and 40,000 troops under NATO command deployed to the alliance's eastern flank.  ""Of course, the United States [is] playing a key role in these efforts,"" Stoltenberg said. ""More U.S. troops in Europe is a strong message of transatlantic unity, and we are extremely grateful for your support to what we do together in the eastern part of the alliance.""  At Wednesday's meeting, ministers would address both the immediate consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the longer-term consequences, Stoltenberg said, including the ""long-term adaptation of our alliance"" and how to ""remove any room for misunderstanding and miscalculation in Moscow about our readiness to protect and defend all our allies.""  ""NATO has a responsibility to ensure that this crisis does not escalate beyond Ukraine, and that's also the reason we have increased our presence in the eastern part of the alliance,"" Stoltenberg said.  — Chloe Taylor  Two people have been killed in airstrikes that hit apartment buildings in Kharkiv in the early hours of Wednesday morning, according to Ukrainian authorities.  Ukraine's State Emergency Service said in a statement Wednesday morning that over the past 24 hours, emergency workers had ""not stopped eliminating the consequences of air bombardments and artillery shelling of residential areas of Kharkiv"" — Ukraine's second biggest city.  Two residential high-rise buildings had caught fire after artillery strikes in the city's Nemyshliany district overnight, the SES said.  The organization added that as of 7:30 a.m. local time on Wednesday, four people had been rescued from the rubble and two bodies had been found.  ""Search work does not stop,"" the SES said. ""Rescuers on the site … managed to save 189 people.""  One person had also been injured during a shelling of a school in Kharkiv at around 3 a.m. local time, officials added.  — Chloe Taylor  Securing an agreement with Moscow on ending the war in Ukraine is beginning to ""sound more realistic,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said.  In an address to the nation on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said while ""we all want peace,"" efforts to secure an end to the hostilities were still needed.    ""It takes patience,"" he said. ""And work ... in particular, [from] our representatives, our delegation in negotiations with the Russian Federation.""  ""It is difficult, but important, because any war ends in an agreement,"" Zelenskyy added. ""Meetings continue. As I am told, the positions in the negotiations sound more realistic. However, time is still needed for the decisions to be in Ukraine's interests.""  — Chloe Taylor  Homes in Kyiv were hit with fresh shelling strikes early this morning, Kyiv emergency services said in a statement.  Emergency services said a 12-storey apartment block in the capital's Shevchenko district had partially collapsed due to shell fragments damaging the building. A neighboring nine-storey building was also damaged, they said.  ""According to preliminary information, 37 people were evacuated, 2 of whom were injured,"" Kyiv's emergency services said.  — Chloe Taylor  Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a participant in talks with Russian officials, said as talks ended yesterday that officials would pick negotiations back up on Wednesday.

"Tesla hikes China-made Model Y price again — by more than $2,000",2022-03-17 06:47:17+00:00,"Tesla raised the price for its cheapest Model Y car in China by 15,060 yuan ($2,372) on Thursday, following two consecutive price hikes for more expensive versions in just over a week.  The standard China-made Model Y now costs 316,900 yuan ($49,932), up from the previous 301,840 yuan ($47,559) on Tuesday, according to data tracked by CNBC. While the cheapest model had remained the same price since January, Tesla recently raised prices for the long-range and performance versions.  The performance Model Y has seen its price rise by 7.7% since January, with the long-range version up by 8% over that time. The price of the cheapest version has climbed by 5% with Thursday's increase.  The consecutive price hikes come as inflation has risen globally and a spike in Covid-19 cases in China disrupts business activity.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently warned that ""Tesla & SpaceX are seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics.""  Reuters reported Wednesday that Tesla is suspending Shanghai factory operations for two days, as China tightens coronavirus restrictions to stem its recent Covid-19 outbreak.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment about the report, or the price increases.  Major cities in China such as Shenzhen and Shanghai have rolled out strict Covid-19 regulations, causing some factories to halt production and putting even more pressure on stressed supply chains. Crucial materials such as semiconductors also remain in short supply.  China is an increasingly important market for Tesla. In 2021, the country's share of Tesla's total revenue rose to 26% from just 12% in 2019.  Tesla and Chinese automaker BYD dominate the fast-growing Chinese electric vehicle market. "
"London insurance firm fined £1 million over bullying, sexual harassment",2022-03-17 07:47:40+00:00,"LONDON — Lloyd's of London, the U.K. insurance giant, has hit one of its member firms with a record £1.05 million ($1.38 million) fine for misconduct, which included allowing an annual inappropriate ""boys' night out"" for a number of years.  Lloyd's said in a notice of censure, published Wednesday, that its syndicate member firm Atrium Underwriters had accepted three charges of ""detrimental conduct.""  One of the charges was for ""sanctioning and tolerating over a period of a number of years up until 2018 an annual 'Boys' Night Out' during which some male members of staff, (including two senior executives in leadership roles) engaged in unprofessional and inappropriate conduct.""  This included ""initiation games, heavy drinking and making inappropriate and sexualised comments about female colleagues.""  Lloyd's also charged Atrium because it failed to notify the insurer about the facts relating to the misconduct of one of its members of staff, referred to in the document as ""Employee A.""  In addition, the notice stated that Employee A's conduct was well known with Atrium, ""but no adequate steps were taken to deal with it.""  ""Employee A's behaviour included a systematic campaign of bullying against a junior employee over a number of years,"" Lloyd's said, adding that Atrium failed to protect the junior member of staff once it became aware of the bullying.  Lloyd's said that Atrium failed to acknowledge or challenge Employee A's behavior, ""motivated in part by the desire of senior managers to protect Atrium from bad publicity.""  The employee who complained about Employee A was also instructed not to speak about Atrium's investigation into the misconduct or the allegations made.  The notice said that because Atrium had settled these proceedings at the ""earliest opportunity,"" Lloyd's Enforcement Board accepted a 30% discount on the fine, which otherwise would have been £1.5 million. Even so, Lloyd's said in a separate statement that this was still the largest ever fine imposed in its 336-year history.  In addition to the fine, Atrium agreed to pay Lloyd's £562,713.50 in costs.  Lloyd's CEO John Neal said the firm was ""deeply disappointed by the behaviour highlighted by this case, and I want to be clear that discrimination, harassment and bullying have no place at Lloyd's.""  He said that all Lloyd's employees should ""expect to work in a culture where they feel safe, valued, and respected.""  An independent survey of workers within the ""Lloyd's market,"" published in September 2019, found that 8% had witnessed sexual harassment during that past year, but just 45% said they felt comfortable raising their concerns.  The survey was commissioned by Lloyd's on the back of reports of sexual harassment within the business. It also found that 22% of respondents had seen people in their organization turn a blind eye to inappropriate behavior. "
XPeng leads investment in $200 million fund focused on 'frontier' tech,2022-03-17 08:09:50+00:00,"China's XPeng said Thursday it led an investment into a new $200 million fund focused on backing electric vehicles and ""frontier technology"" start-ups.  The fund, called Rockets Capital, also counts a number of high-profile venture capital players among the investors including IDG Capital, eGarden, Sequoia China, 5Y Capital and GGV Capital.  Rockets Capital will focus on ""venture and growth stage investments in Smart EV industry value chain, clean energy, and frontier technology areas.""  XPeng did not expand on what ""frontier technology"" would include, but China's government has identified several areas that fall under this umbrella, including artificial intelligence and semiconductors.  The latest fund comes as the electric vehicle industry is expected to continue its growth. Market research firm Gartner forecasts 6 million electric cars will be shipped this year versus 4 million in 2021.  But global financial markets have also seen large volatility with Chinese technology stocks in particular taking a hammering, though they have staged a comeback in the last two days.  Bing Yuan, managing partner of Rockets Capital, said the closing of the fund is a ""testimony that in the constantly evolving investment industry, the low carbon economy and technology-driven development are the consensus investment trends.""  Rockets Capital will operate independently from XPeng. The electric car company said the fund will leverage XPeng's ""industry expertise and resources"" and ""incubate technological innovation.""  The fund has already ""entered into agreements"" to invest in companies, XPeng said without disclosing any names. "
How much can — and will — China help Russia as its economy crumbles?,2022-03-16 15:07:20+00:00,"Sanctions, asset freezes and withdrawals of international companies are hammering the Russian economy in response to President Vladimir Putin's military assault on Ukraine, leaving Moscow with only one ally powerful enough to rely on as a source of potential support: China.  ""I think that our partnership with China will still allow us to maintain the cooperation that we have achieved, and not only maintain, but also increase it in an environment where Western markets are closing,"" Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Sunday.   U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan, in response, said it had warned Beijing that there ""will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them."" On Monday, U.S. and Chinese diplomats discussed the issue over seven hours of talks.   Siluanov had made reference to U.S.-led asset freezes on nearly half of Russia's central bank reserves – $300 billion of the $640 billion in gold and foreign currency that it had amassed since a previous wave of Western sanctions that followed its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014.  The remaining reserves are in gold and Chinese yuan, effectively making China Moscow's main potential source of foreign exchange to back up the spiraling ruble amid devastating capital outflows.  In some of Beijing's most explicit comments on the sanctions yet, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Monday during a call with a European counterpart that ""China is not a party to the crisis, nor does it want the sanctions to affect China."" He added that ""China has the right to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.""  Spokespersons for China's Dubai consulate, its Abu Dhabi embassy and its South African embassy were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.  How much could China help ease Russia's economic pain? Quite a lot, theoretically.  If China decided to open up a full swap line with Russia, accepting rubles as payment for anything it needed to buy — including crucial imports like technology parts and semiconductors that Moscow has been cut off from in the latest rounds of sanctions — China could essentially plug most of the holes fired into Russia's economy by the West.   But whether that's entirely in Beijing's interest to do so, and how much it could backfire, is another matter.  ""In terms of to what extent China could help Russia, they could help them a ton,"" Maximilian Hess, a Central Asia fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told CNBC. ""But they would be risking major secondary sanctions on themselves, major renewed trade and sanctions war with the U.S. and the West as well.""  Given the uncertain state of Chinese markets over the last few weeks, amid mounting inflation and a major new Covid-19 outbreak in the country, ""it might not be the best time to do that,"" Hess said.  Still, Beijing does have a long-held alliance with Russia and can benefit from its position.   Before the invasion, Beijing and Moscow announced a ""no limits"" strategic partnership they said was intended to counter U.S. influence. China's position has been to ultimately blame the U.S. and NATO's eastward expansion for the conflict, and on March 7 its foreign minister, Wang, called Russia his country's ""most important strategic partner.""  ""No matter how perilous the international landscape, we will maintain our strategic focus and promote the development of a comprehensive China-Russia partnership in the new era,"" Wang said from Beijing.   And while China's government has expressed ""concern"" over the conflict in Ukraine, it has refused to call it an invasion or condemn Russia, largely pushing Moscow's narrative of the war on its state news outlets.  ""China and Putin have a clear interest in working together more closely,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, wrote in an early March research note.  ""China is happy to cause problems for the West and would not mind turning Russia gradually into its pliant junior partner."" It could also take advantage of its position to buy Russian oil, gas and other commodities at discounted prices, similar to what it's been doing with Iran.   To what extent China's leadership steps in to support Moscow will play a key role in the future of Russia's economy. China is Russia's top export market after the European Union; trade between China and Russia reached a record high of $146.9 billion in 2021, up 35.9% year on year, according to China's customs agency. Russian exports to China were worth $79.3 billion in 2021, with oil and gas accounting for 56% of that. China's imports from Russia exceeded exports by more than $10 billion last year.   ""Russia can use China over time as a bigger alternative market for its raw material exports and a conduit to help circumvent Western sanctions,"" Schmieding said.  ""But for both countries with their very different perceptions of history, it could be an uneasy and fragile alliance that may not outlast Putin.""  The powerful alliance of the G-7 economies, composed of the U.S. and its European and Asian partners, can slap harsh secondary sanctions on any entity that supports Moscow. But the problem here is that China's economy is the second largest in the world and is a key part of global supply chains. It impacts global markets far more than Russia does. Any move to sanction China would mean much greater global effects, and likely economic pain for the West, too.    Beijing likely seeks a ""third way somewhere between the binary choice of supporting Russia or refusing to do so,"" analysts at New York-based research firm Rhodium Group wrote in a note in early March. That middle path involves ""quietly maintaining existing channels of economic engagement with Russia … while minimizing the exposure of China's financial institutions to Western sanctions.""   Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:  Indeed, in early March, the chairman of China's banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, said China opposed ""unilateral"" sanctions and would continue normal trade relations with the affected parties.  But maintaining that kind of economic engagement with Russia will be ""hard to conceal under the current sanctions architecture,"" Rhodium's analysts wrote.   Could Beijing keep letting Russia access and trade with its yuan reserves, which total around $90 billion, or about 14% of Russia's FX reserves? Yes. But what if Beijing allowed Russia's central bank to sell yuan-denominated assets for dollars or euros? That would likely expose it to sanctions.  China can still trade with Russian firms in rubles and yuan through the Russian banks that haven't yet been sanctioned. But despite many years of working to increase bilateral trade in their own currencies, the vast majority of that trade – including 88% of Russian exports – is still invoiced in dollars or euros.   Not only that, but China could be essentially catching a falling knife by taking on the credit and sanctions risks of Russia's rapidly deteriorating economy.   ""China could alleviate the vast majority of the pain,"" Hess said. ""But if they offered those swap lines and everything, effectively they'd be taking all the liabilities and risks of the Russian economy onto their own balance sheet at a time when the Russian economy is at its weakest in decades.""   ""So that's maybe not the wisest move economically,"" Hess said. ""But politics are different decisions.""   "
Covid pushed 4.7 million people in Southeast Asia into poverty: ADB,2022-03-17 05:38:52+00:00,"Southeast Asia is grappling with high poverty levels as recurring waves of Covid-19 have dealt a blow to the region's labor market, said the Asian Development Bank.  Last year, the pandemic pushed 4.7 million more people in Southeast Asia into extreme poverty — which is defined as those living on less than $1.90 per day — and erased 9.3 million jobs in the region, the ADB said in a report published on Wednesday.  ""The pandemic has led to widespread unemployment, worsening inequality, and rising poverty levels, especially among women, younger workers, and the elderly in Southeast Asia,"" said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa.  Many countries in Southeast Asia have lost their hard-won economic and development gains as they continue to struggle with the spread of the omicron Covid variant.  Though ADB expects growth of 5.1% in 2022 as higher vaccination rates prompt economies to reopen, it warned that the new variant could cut growth by as much as 0.8%.  The countries with the highest number of reported Covid-19 cases in the region since the pandemic began are Vietnam (6.55 million), Indonesia (5.91 million), and Malaysia (3.87 million) — all developing ones — online publication Our World In Data showed.  ""The pandemic's impact on poverty and unemployment will likely persist as inactive workers become de-skilled and poor people's access to opportunities further deteriorates,"" ADB said. ""When this happens, the deterioration in inequality will transfer across generations.""  Despite the volatility the pandemic has created, ADB is optimistic that Southeast Asian economies are beginning to recover.  Southeast Asian countries have mostly been ""taking care of their own house"" since the Asian financial crisis, and that has put them in a better position to ""weather the storm"" of the pandemic, said ADB Vice President Ahmed Saeed.  The region, which relies heavily on its tourism industry for growth, expects to see the sector gradually pick up as travel borders begin to open, providing more opportunities for economic growth and jobs.  ""Tourism tends to bounce back and to be more robust through the cycle than we expected,"" Saeed told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Wednesday.  ""Would additional waves of the Covid virus and variants set that back? Yes. But I think ... once the clouds clear ... we will ultimately get back past our 2019 tourism numbers across the region and beyond those,"" he added.  But Southeast Asia still has a long way to go.  Although overall international tourist arrivals increased by 58% in July to September 2021 compared with the same period in 2020, it remained 64% below 2019 levels, the report stated.  ""At present, tourism related goods and services including transport, accommodation, recreation, and other personal services will likely remain weak while travel remains curtailed and social distancing is enforced,"" ADB said.  To expedite the region's economic recovery, ADB urged Southeast Asian governments to invest more in their health-care systems.  While the virus could cause long-term damage to economies by causing severe disruptions to supply chains and labor markets, a lack of investment in health care is also worsening inequality, the bank said.  Allocating more resources would ""help health systems deliver care, improve disease surveillance, and respond to future pandemics,"" the bank said.  ADB said Southeast Asia's economic growth could increase by 1.5% if health spending in the region reaches about 5% of gross domestic product, compared with 3% in 2021.  ""Countries that had greater internal health care capacity, greater levels of wealth ... managed to come through this process better than"" middle- and low-income countries that lack health-care systems and infrastructure, Saeed said.

Ukraine President Zelenskyy makes speech to Congress on Russia war,2022-03-16 16:50:53+00:00,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday invoked the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and the Sept. 11 terror strikes on America as he pleaded directly with the U.S. Congress to send more aid to his embattled country to fight against Russia's invasion.  Zelenskyy, who was greeted with at least three standing ovations from an audience of lawmakers, asked the U.S. to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stem the Russian attacks, which have led to the deaths of thousands of people.  ""This is a terror that Europe has not seen, has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for a reply, for an answer to this terror from the whole world,"" said Zelenskyy, who during his speech played a video showing the bombing of Ukraine and wounded and dead civilians.  ""Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask?"" he said via video link from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.  Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:  Zelenskyy acknowledged that Western leaders have resisted the idea of a no-fly zone, which would require NATO to take over the air and shoot down enemies to protect civilians on the ground. It's been repeatedly rejected out of fears of triggering another world war.  ""If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative,"" he said.  That included additional weapons and humanitarian support beyond what has already been granted to Ukraine, as well as even tougher sanctions on Russia and leading Russian supporters of that country's president, Vladimir Putin, he said.  ""Constantly, every week, until the Russian military machine stops, restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to additional sanctions.  He also urged members of Congress to get companies in their legislative districts to leave the Russian market, ""because it is flooded with our blood.""  ""I call on you to do more,"" he said.  Referring to President Joe Biden by name, Zelenskyy said he wanted his American counterpart to lead the world, not just the U.S., in the face of Russian aggression.  ""Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace,"" Zelenskyy said.  Biden is expected to announce hundreds of millions of dollars in additional aid to Ukraine later Wednesday.  Zelenskyy was introduced for his address by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  ""Glory to heroes,"" Pelosi said in Ukrainian before he began speaking.  Zelenskyy began by saying, ""I'm proud to greet you from Ukraine from our capital city ... that is under missile and airstrikes from Russian troops every day, but it doesn't give up.""  ""And we have not even thought about it for a second. Just like many other cities, and communities in our beautiful country, which found themselves in the worst war since World War II,"" he said.  Zelenskyy soon returned to that linkage with World War II after noting what he called America's foundational tenets of ""democracy, independence, freedom and care for everyone.""  ""We in Ukraine want the same for our people,"" he said. ""All that is normal part of your own life.""  ""Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Americans in your great history, you have pages that will allow you to understand Ukrainians. Understand us now, when you need it,"" Zelenskyy said.  ""Right now when we need you right now. Remember Pearl Harbor, [the] terrible morning of Dec. 7, 1941. When your sky was black from the planes attacking you,"" he said.  ""Just remember ... September the 11th. A terrible day in 2001 when [al-Qaeda suicide squads] will try to turn your cities, independent territories into battlefields. When innocent people were attacked,"" he said.  Just as the U.S. could not stop those attacks from the air on those days, Zelenskyy said, ""our country experiences the same, every day, right now.""  ""Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,"" he said. ""Russian troops have already fired nearly a thousand missiles at Ukraine. Countless bombs. They use drones to kill us with precision."" "
Russia sees China as sanctions lifeline; U.S. threatens 'consequences',2022-03-19 01:55:07+00:00,"WASHINGTON — Two days after national security advisor Jake Sullivan warned his Chinese counterpart of serious consequences if Beijing helps Russia wage its war against Ukraine, what exactly they might be remains shrouded in secrecy.  ""We're going to have this conversation directly with China and Chinese leadership, not through the media,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday.   Psaki said that Sullivan was ""very direct about the consequences"" during his Monday meeting in Rome with China's top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi.   ""But in terms of any potential impacts or consequences, we'll lead those through private diplomatic channels at this point,"" Psaki said.  As Russia's invasion of Ukraine approaches its fourth week, concerns over how Western allies will react if China or Chinese companies try to assist Moscow in evading sanctions imposed by the U.S., U.K., Europe and Japan have added a new level of uncertainty to global markets already reeling from the collapse of the Russian economy.  That uncertainty is compounded by the fresh memory of what happened the last time the White House issued vague warnings about consequences, during the lead-up to Russia's invasion.  On Feb. 20, four days before Russian troops marched into Ukraine, Psaki issued a statement saying the U.S. was ""ready to impose swift and severe consequences"" if Russian carried out its apparent plans.  Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:  At the time, few analysts believed the United States and Europe could actually reach consensus on the most severe sanctions under consideration — like freezing Russia's central bank reserves. But they did, catching both Moscow and Wall Street off guard.  When it comes to China, no one wants to make the same mistake again.  Moscow has reportedly asked Beijing for military and economic assistance to wage its war against Ukraine, although both governments publicly deny it.   But China has little interest in becoming embroiled in the economic battle between Moscow and the rest of the developed world.  ""China is not a party to the crisis, nor does it want the sanctions to affect China,"" foreign minister Wang Yi said during a phone call Monday with Spain's foreign minister, Jose Manuel Albares.   Still, Wang insisted that ""China has the right to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,"" according to an official notice of the call from Beijing.  In the past week, it has become increasingly clear that the Kremlin views Beijing as an economic lifeline.  Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov said Sunday that his country's economic ""partnership with China will still allow us to maintain the cooperation that we have achieved … but also increase it in an environment where Western markets are closing"" to Russian exports.  This ""increased"" cooperation from China could take several different forms. Some of them would overtly violate sanctions against Russia, triggering an automatic responses from the U.S. But experts say other actions Beijing might take would be technically legal, forcing the U.S. to rely more on soft power tactics to counter them.  Overt violations could include helping Russia get around U.S. export controls on high-tech equipment by purchasing American products and then selling them to Moscow.  That move would be very risky for businesses, however. The sanctions are specifically written to apply not only to American companies, but to any company in the world that uses U.S. software or components, which includes many in China.  Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo recently explained what the consequences would be for a major Chinese semiconductor company, if the U.S. learned it was selling chips to Russia in violation of American export controls.   ""We could essentially shut [the company] down, because we prevent them from using our equipment and our software,"" Raimondo said in an interview with The New York Times on March 8.  Raimondo's example highlights how the U.S. can leverage its economic power to make any company's decision to help Russia evade sanctions, essentially, a fatal one.  ""Most large institutions in China are not willing to take the risk of falling afoul of U.S. sanctions, and so any sanction busting is likely to be done by smaller institutions that have less to lose,"" said Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  ""Overall, China looks like it's going to complain but comply,"" he told The Washington Post.  Another possible avenue for cooperation between Russia and China would be for Beijing to buy Russian oil and gas on the cheap, Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow and Russia chair at the think tank Carnegie Moscow Center, told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Monday.  ""There will be no formal violation of U.S. and EU sanctions, but that will be a significant material lifeline to the regime"" in Russia, Gabuev said.  That kind of Sino-Russian cooperation demands a different response from the United States, working together with European allies to emphasize the long-term risk to China's reputation on the world stage.  ""[Russian President] Vladimir Putin is … the bad guy in the eyes of the world"" and Moscow is fast becoming a ""pariah state,"" said Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S.  ""Russia, Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, Iran — this isn't really the international club that most Chinese people aspire to be part of,"" Daly said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Tuesday.  As civilian casualties in Ukraine mount and TVs around the world broadcast images of bombed out residential areas and brave Ukrainian resistance fighters, ""circumstances are pushing China further in that direction,"" said Daly.  But that doesn't mean the country will break with its longtime ally. Instead, Beijing can be expected to be ""religious about observing"" the U.S. and EU sanctions but do ""everything possible"" to help Moscow, Gabuev said.  — CNBC's Eustance Huang and Weizhen Tan contributed reporting.

"European markets, investors react to Fed hike",2022-03-17 16:50:00+00:00,"LONDON — European stocks closed higher on Thursday as investors reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve's first rate hike in years.  The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed up 0.4%, with oil and gas stocks adding 2.2%. The U.K. FTSE 100 was the standout gainer with a rise of 1.2%.  The Bank of England on Thursday raised interest rates for the third consecutive meeting and struck a dovish tone as the Russia-Ukraine conflict is expected to keep inflation higher for longer.  The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 in favor of a further 0.25 percentage point hike to its main Bank Rate, taking it to 0.75%.

What we know about the economic impact of China's Covid spike,2022-03-16 08:02:03+00:00,"BEIJING — China's latest Covid-19 outbreak could hit first-quarter gross domestic product by at least half of a percentage point, Citi analysts predicted in a report Tuesday.  In the last few days, mainland China has seen its worst Covid outbreak since the initial height of the pandemic in early 2020 — when the economy contracted. The latest surge in cases, which stems from the highly transmissible omicron variant, has forced some manufacturing hubs across the country to suspend or limit production.  The most affected regions account for 16.7% of national GDP, according to Citi estimates.  ""Economic loss may be real this time,"" the analysts said. ""Jointly considering the spillover effect to other regions, we think the lockdown and tightened quarantine measures this round could potentially deduct ~0.5-0.8 ppt of GDP growth in Q1, assuming no policy responses.""  Mainland China reported 1,860 confirmed Covid cases for Tuesday, down from more than 3,500 new cases a day earlier. The country has not reported new deaths, and the number of new cases is still far lower than in other parts of the world, such as Europe.  Beijing's zero-Covid policy measures have prompted analysts to issue reports about growing risks of drags on the world's second-largest economy, even if few are able to put a number on it yet.  ""We believe the omicron wave presents both risks and opportunities for China,"" Bank of America Securities' China equity strategy team said in a report Tuesday.  If the pandemic is managed well, the analysts said, the outbreaks could help China prepare to reopen its borders. But if not, they said the omicron wave ""could cause significant downside to China's GDP growth and disruption to the global supply chains in the near term, and potentially accelerate the decoupling and supply chain relocation in the medium term.""  So far, the analysts' research and checks with local factories reveal limited impact on the production of chips, autos, apparel and beer, among other industries. The Android smartphone supply chain could be among the harder-hit, the report said. But, like other industries, production could be shifted to other locations.  For autos, the analysts said that ""according to channel checks, a couple of Shanghai-based names saw bigger disruption, while BYD's Shenzhen plant is operating normally as of 14th March.""  BYD did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.  The lockdown and production suspension measures announced by Shenzhen and Dongguan — two manufacturing hubs in the export-heavy province of Guangdong — will last only about a week.  Economic data for January and February reported on Tuesday came in well above expectations, and the National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson said the impact of the virus would mostly be at a local level.  ""March may be a different picture depending on how long the restrictions in Shenzhen and Jilin last for,"" said Francoise Huang, senior economist at Euler Hermes, a subsidiary of Allianz. ""If it just lasts for one or two weeks, it might become a blip in the data.""  The latest Covid wave has hit the northern Chinese province of Jilin the hardest, with the region accounting for the majority of daily new cases. The province banned travel to other parts of China on Monday, and is building emergency hospitals.  Although Jilin's capital of Changchun is an auto manufacturing center, contribution to China's GDP is 0.65%, less than Dongguan's 0.95% and Shenzhen's 2.73% share, according to Citi.  China has upheld a zero-Covid policy of travel restrictions and swift lockdowns of neighborhoods or office towers to control outbreaks. At least in Beijing, individuals with a travel history linked to confirmed cases may need to quarantine at home for a week or more.  But the implementation of the policy has been targeted.  For example, a Shanghai government official said Tuesday there is no need to lock down the city to control the outbreak. And while Shenzhen has ordered overall production halts and remote work, its ports largely remain open.  ""We have been notified that all ports and terminals in Shenzhen (Yantian and Chiwan) are currently working as normal,"" shipping giant Maersk said in a statement. ""This includes vessel operations, yard handling and gate-in-and-out.""  ""However, local warehouses have been closed and trucking services have been impacted due to the lockdown. In other Chinese ports, there hasn't been any operational impact, but landside transportation efficiency has been reduced,"" the company said.  The Yantian port said in an online statement Monday it was operating normally.  The Shenzhen government announced Tuesday the closure of the Liantang Port at the land border with Hong Kong. Shenzhen has reported several confirmed Covid cases from freight drivers across that border, but no announcements of other port closures.  Morgan Stanley says these Chinese stocks could rebound — Alibaba, Tencent aren't on the list  Wall Street banks name their favorite Asia stocks — and Citi says one could have upside of 167%  Xpeng and more: Morgan Stanley says these stocks will benefit from rising oil prices  If recent lockdowns persist, the ""economic pain"" could last past the first quarter into the early part of the second, a Moody's Analytics report said Tuesday.  ""China may be early enough in the wave that the various lockdowns will reduce COVID-19 cases to zero by the end of March, unlike the situation in Hong Kong, where the current surge in cases has been ongoing since February with no equivalent lockdown,"" the report said. ""However, this is shaping up to be the biggest test for China's zero-COVID stance.""  China began rolling out a nationwide vaccination campaign in late 2020 — with doses largely from Sinopharm and Sinovac. As of Monday, about 1.24 billion people had been fully vaccinated, including 211.62 million people over the age of 60, according to the National Health Commission.  The commission said that 65% of older adults diagnosed with severe Covid were not vaccinated.  The share of the BA.2 omicron subvariant among Covid cases has increased significantly in the last two months, China's National Health Commission said Tuesday.  The new variant is more transmissible than previous strains, but it's unclear whether it's more deadly.  — CNBC's Holly Ellyatt and Michael Bloom contributed to this report. "
Russia central bank warns of 'large-scale structural' economic transformation,2022-03-18 13:51:16+00:00,"The Central Bank of Russia on Friday held its monetary policy steady and maintained its key interest rate at 20%, but warned of considerable uncertainty as the country's economy undergoes a ""large-scale structural transformation.""  In late February, shortly after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, the CBR more than doubled the country's key interest rate from 9.5% to 20% in an effort to prop up its plunging currency and mitigate the impact of tough international sanctions.  In its statement Friday, the CBR said the sharp increase in its key rate had ""helped sustain financial stability.""  ""The Russian economy is entering the phase of a large-scale structural transformation, which will be accompanied by a temporary but inevitable period of increased inflation, mainly related to adjustments of relative prices across a wide range of goods and services,"" it said.  ""The Bank of Russia's monetary policy is set to enable a gradual adaptation of the economy to new conditions and a return of annual inflation to 4% in 2024.""  The ruble sank to record lows against the dollar on the back of a barrage of new sanctions and penalties imposed on Moscow by the U.S. and European allies, before moderating in recent weeks. The currency sat at just over 104 to the dollar following the decision Friday.  Earlier this week, Russia managed to stave off a historic debt default by completing some of its sovereign bond payments in dollars, Reuters reported. The Russian Finance Ministry said Friday that it had met its obligations to pay coupons on dollar-denominated eurobonds in full.  The CBR's large quantities of foreign currency reserves were targeted by Western sanctions that aimed to render them almost inaccessible, preventing policymakers from mitigating the depreciation in domestic assets.  While the decision was expected, the central bank's statement gave some insight into how it views the economic outlook for Russia at present.  William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said there were three key takeaways, the first of which was that the central bank seems to think it has done enough with last month's emergency hike to stabilize the financial system and prevent a run on Russian banks.  ""Second, the CBR sees sanctions and a shift by the Russian government towards autarky and isolationism as something that is here for the long haul,"" Jackson said, noting that the statement mentioned the ""large-scale structural transformation"" on several occasions.  ""And third, despite that, policymakers at the CBR are trying to maintain a semblance of macroeconomic orthodoxy. The over-riding focus of the statement was on the balance of inflation risks and that monetary policy would remain tight to prevent second-round effects from the current inflation spike from taking hold.""  This may indicate that policymakers aim to roll back the current capital controls, revert to a floating ruble and return the focus of monetary policy to inflation-targeting eventually, Jackson suggested.

"Russia-Ukraine war updates for March 18, 2022",2022-03-19 08:03:59+00:00,"This has been CNBC's live blog covering updates on the war in Ukraine. [Follow the latest updates here.]  Several missiles have hit an aircraft repair center on the outskirts of Lviv, western Ukraine, the city's mayor said Friday.  The strikes suggest Russian forces are continuing to widen their attack. Lviv has, so far, not been the site of active hostilities, and many Ukrainians have fled to the city.  Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping about the need for peace in Ukraine.  Russia also called a special United Nations Security Council meeting in New York City this morning to discuss the Kremlin's claims that the U.S. is developing biological weapons in Ukraine. The U.S. and Ukraine have denied those claims.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Russia to come to the table for talks.   ""Meaningful peace and security talks for Ukraine are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,"" he said a video address on Saturday.  ""It's time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Otherwise, Russia's losses will be such that you will not have several generations to rise.""  — Joanna Tan  Biden held a nearly two-hour phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Both Biden and Xi agreed on the need to promote peace and assist with the humanitarian disaster created by the invasion. But they disagreed deeply on who is responsible for the suffering in Ukraine, with the Chinese leader refusing to hold Russia singularly accountable for the unprovoked invasion.  Instead, official readouts from Beijing made it clear that Xi's position was that the U.S. and Europe had provoked Russian President Vladimir Putin into attacking Ukraine by expanding NATO into Eastern Europe.  During the call, Biden ""described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia,"" the White House said.  — Christina Wilkie  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country has opened a temporary residency program for Ukrainian refugees.  Canada is now taking applications that will allow Ukranians to stay as temporary residents for up to three years under an extended visitor visa program, as opposed to a six-month visa.  The program expedites processing and waives application fees.  — Dawn Kopecki  The U.S. Commerce Department will effectively ground 100 airplanes that have recently flown to Russia and are believed to violate U.S. export controls, including a plane used by Russian businessman Roman Abramovich, officials told Reuters.  The list, seen by Reuters, includes 99 Boeing airplanes operated by Russian passenger and cargo carriers including Aeroflot, AirBridge Cargo, Utair, Nordwind, Azur Air and Aviastar-TU — as well as Abramovich's Gulfstream G650 — and could further hinder Russian efforts to continue some international flights.  The Commerce Department will warn companies and other entities around the world that any refueling, maintenance, repair, or spare parts or services violate U.S. export controls and subject companies to U.S. enforcement actions that could include ""substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions,"" the department said.  — Reuters  Russians celebrate the 8th anniversary of the annexation of Crimea.  — Adam Jeffery  Ukrainian officials expect that the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant will be working again next week after the site was damaged by Russian shelling.  Ukrainian engineers are currently repairing one of three disconnected power lines linking the country's largest nuclear power plant to the electricity grid, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi wrote in a statement.  Russian forces took control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant on March 4. A week prior, Russian forces took control of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant.  – Amanda Macias  U.S. officials are still working to get access to WNBA star Brittney Griner after she was arrested by Russian authorities nearly a month ago on accusations of smuggling drugs into the country.  State Department spokesman Ned Price said the U.S. has been consistently denied consular access to American citizens detained in Russia.  Earlier in the week, a Russian court denied the 31-year-old athlete house arrest amid an ongoing pre-trial investigation. Griner is being accused of smuggling hashish oil, a charge that carries up to 10 years in prison.  Griner's arrest came days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine triggering international backlash and a slew of punishing sanctions.  – Amanda Macias  French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for a little over an hour, an Elysee source confirmed to NBC News.  Macron, according to the person familiar with the details of the call, raised concerns over reports that Russian forces are launching attacks on civilian and nonmilitary sites.  The Elysee source said Putin again placed the blame for the ongoing war and any crimes against humanity in Ukraine on Kyiv.  The Kremlin's readout of the call said Putin stressed that ""Russian Armed Forces are doing everything possible to save the lives of civilians, including by organizing humanitarian corridors for their safe evacuation.""  Macron and Putin have spoken at least a dozen times in the past month.  – Amanda Macias  President Joe Biden held a nearly two-hour phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The call was seen as a critical test of whether Biden can convince China to stay on the sidelines of the conflict in Ukraine, and to turn down Russian requests for military or economic aid.  According to a readout of the call from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xi told Biden that the United States and China each had an obligation to promote peace.  The White House has yet to issue a formal readout of the call, but said it began just after 9 a.m. and lasted just shy of two hours. That's an unusually long time for a presidential call with the leader of a U.S. adversary.  — Christina Wilkie  A bipartisan delegation of 10 U.S. senators will travel to Poland and Germany this weekend to meet with U.S. military leaders, NGOs and Ukrainian refugees.  The delegation will include Sens.

""It is Moscow that has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law, not Ukraine. It is Moscow that has a well documented history of using chemical weapons, not Ukraine. And it is Moscow that started the senseless war,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.  ""Russia is abusing his responsibilities and privileges as a permanent member of the security council,"" she added.  ""Our mandate is to serve as a venue for achieving peace through diplomacy. Russia's subversion of our mission, and its horrific campaign of violence against the Ukrainian people, are deeply shameful,"" said Thomas-Greenfield.  --- Christina Wilkie  President Joe Biden's call with Chinese President Xi Jinping began at 9:03 a.m. ET, a White House official confirmed to NBC News.  In the days before the call, Washington warned that the world's second-largest economy should avoid financial support to Russia as global sanctions levied in response to the Kremlin's war in Ukraine set in.  The call follows an intense seven-hour meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Rome on Monday. The U.S. delegation, led by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, conveyed to Beijing's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, that China should not assist Russia as it attacks Ukraine.  – Amanda Macias  Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi posted a picture on Telegram Friday that showed a protest in the city's Rynok Square.  Empty strollers were placed in the square in memory of the 109 children that Ukrainian authorities say have been killed since the beginning of the war.  ""We call on all adults around the world to stand as one shield to protect Ukrainian children and give them future."" Sadovyi said. ""Urge the governments of other countries to close the sky over Ukraine.""  NATO members Lithuania and Estonia have formally called for a closure of Ukraine's skies in recent days.

In a tweet, von der Leyen also said she had told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the EU was disbursing a ""second tranche of around €300 million of macro-financial assistance to Ukraine.""  — Chloe Taylor  The governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Spain and Belgium placed orders with MC Armor, a Colombian body-armor manufacturer based in Bogota, for bulletproof vests and helmets to be donated to Ukraine.   -Adam Jeffery  Kyiv city administration said on Telegram Friday that 222 people — including 60 civilians and four children — had been killed in Ukraine's capital since Russia invaded the country.  Officials added that 889 people had been wounded in Kyiv since the invasion began, 241 of whom were civilians. That figure included 18 children, three ambulance drivers and one ambulance doctor.  — Chloe Taylor  Liudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's human rights ombudswoman, said on Ukrainian television Friday that 130 people had been rescued from a bombed theater in Mariupol.  But 1,300 people were still stuck in the building's basement, she added.  The theater in the besieged city of Mariupol, where more than 1,000 civilians were said to be sheltering, was bombed on Wednesday.  Satellite images taken on March 14 by U.S. government-linked Maxar appear to show the theater prior to the bombing, with the word ""children"" spelled out — in Russian — in large letters in front of and behind the building.  Russia denied that its forces were responsible for the bombing, which was decried by Ukrainian officials as a war crime.  Michael Carpenter, U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in an address on Thursday that ""the building was clearly marked as having children inside, but Russia bombed it anyway.""  — Chloe Taylor  Russian forces are ""trying to take measures to increase the number of troops in the direction of Kyiv by moving uncoordinated and incompetent units from [Russia's] Central and Eastern military districts,"" Ukraine's armed forces said in a Facebook post Friday.  Russian troops were regrouping and trying to establish logistical support in the Slobozhansky and Sumy areas of Ukraine, the update said.  Russia was continuing to try to capture the city of Izyum, Ukrainian officials also said, adding that Moscow's forces were ""trying to establish a strict administrative and police regime in the temporarily occupied settlements of the Kherson region.""  Earlier this month, Kherson became the first major Ukrainian city to fall to Russia. Its residents have since taken to the streets on several occasions to protest the city's occupation.  — Chloe Taylor  The International Energy Agency has published a 10-point plan to cut oil use, saying its proposed actions could lower oil demand by 2.7 million barrels a day within four months — equivalent to the oil demand of all the cars in China.  Its plan outlined practical actions that individuals and governments in advanced economies can take to reduce the risk of a major supply crunch, reduce price pain and economic damage, and shrink Russia's hydrocarbon revenues.  The suggested actions included reducing speed limits on highways by at least 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), alternating private car access to roads in big cities, using high speed and night trains instead of planes where possible, and making public transport cheaper.  ""As a result of Russia's appalling aggression against Ukraine, the world may well be facing its biggest oil supply shock in decades, with huge implications for our economies and societies,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol warned in a press release Friday.  — Chloe Taylor  Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz this morning, and will have a call with French President Emmanuel Macron this evening, the Kremlin said Friday.  Putin was also due to hold an operational meeting with Russia's Security Council on Friday, a Kremlin spokesperson told reporters.  — Chloe Taylor  Russian forces ""have made minimal progress this week,"" the U.K. said in an intelligence update on Friday.  ""Ukrainian forces around Kyiv and Mykolaiv continue to frustrate Russian attempts to encircle the cities,"" the British Ministry of Defense said. ""The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain encircled and subject to heavy Russian shelling.""  The ministry warned that the number of Ukrainian refugees — which has already surpassed 3 million — would continue to rise ""as a result of ongoing Russian aggression.""  — Chloe Taylor  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Friday that he had spoken to the EU's top diplomat about the preparation of the bloc's fifth sanctions package against Russia.  — Chloe Taylor  Humanitarian needs in Ukraine are ""increasing exponentially,"" a U.N. official said Friday.  Speaking in Geneva, Matthew Saltmarsh, a spokesperson for the U.N. Refugees Agency, said many people across Ukraine remained trapped in areas of escalating conflict, and were unable to meet their basic needs — including food, water and medicines — because essential services were being disrupted.  ""With more than 3.1 million refugees forced to flee Ukraine over the past three weeks, and millions internally displaced within the country, the U.N. Refugee Agency is warning that humanitarian needs are increasing exponentially,"" Saltmarsh said.  ""In addition to those who have had to flee, around 13 million people have been affected in the areas hardest hit by the war within Ukraine and are in need of humanitarian and protection assistance.""  He noted that the humanitarian situation in cities like Mariupol and Sumy was ""extremely dire,"" with residents facing potentially fatal shortages of food, water and medicines.  Earlier this month, Ukrainian officials said a child died of dehydration in the besieged city of Mariupol.  — Chloe Taylor  Since Russia invaded Ukraine, 109 children have been killed in the conflict and 130 have been injured, Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said Friday.  ""The largest number of victims was recorded in Kyiv region — 55 children,"" the office said in a statement.  It added that the number of children killed in the regions of Kharkiv, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Mykolaiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, and Kherson, was also growing.  The Prosecutor General's Office noted that these figures were not final, as it was impossible to inspect conflict zones due to the continuation of hostilities.  More than 439 educational institutions across Ukraine had been damaged by Russian bombings, the office added, 63 of which were completely destroyed.  — Chloe Taylor  Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday morning that one person had been killed in airstrikes on the capital, while 19 people — including four children — had been injured.  Ukraine's State Emergency Services had already confirmed the death of a civilian earlier on Friday morning, saying in a statement that a fire had broken out in a five-story apartment block in the Podil district after the building was hit by a rocket.  Klitschko added in his statement that six houses, a kindergarten and a school were damaged in the shelling strike.  — Chloe Taylor  Japan's foreign and trade ministries jointly announced on Friday that Tokyo would impose sanctions on 15 Russian individuals and nine organizations.  The move will raise the number of Russian individuals sanctioned by Japan to 76, and the number of organizations to 12.  The 15 additional individuals include Russian Foreign Ministry Press Secretary Maria Zakharova, Deputy Minister of Defense Alexey Krivoruchko, Rosoboronexport CEO Alexander Mikheev and Suleyman Kerimov, owner of financial and industrial group Nafta.  The additional organizations include Rosneft Aero, United Shipbuilding Corporation and Kurganmashzavod.  — Chloe Taylor  Ukrainian forces shot down some Russian missiles fired from the Black Sea toward Lviv early Friday morning, an official has said.  But some of the missiles made it past Ukraine's defenses and struck an aircraft repair plant on the outskirts of the city.  ""Today there was a strike to the city of Lviv,"" Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Ukraine's Lviv region, said in a Facebook post translated by NBC News. ""The air alert worked and the armed forces worked. Some of the missiles fired from the Black Sea were shot down. Four of them hit, as you already know, in the aircraft repair plant.""  Lviv, in western Ukraine, has so far not been the scene of active hostilities, with many refugees flocking to the city to escape conflict in other parts of the country.  Kozytskyi said one person had been wounded in Friday's strike, and no one had been killed.  He noted that the Lviv region currently has ""no working military facilities … at all,"" suggesting that this meant Russia was purposely targeting civilians.  ""This is an attack on the city of Lviv, to the humanitarian hub, which now has at least 200,000 displaced people who have already left the war once,"" Kozytskyi said. ""The enemy's attack on the city of Lviv is once again a confirmation that they are not at war with the Ukrainian army, but at war with the population: women, children, immigrants. They have nothing sacred.""  A spokesperson for the Russian government was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.  — Chloe Taylor  British broadcasting regulator Ofcom has revoked RT's license to broadcast in the U.K. with immediate effect.  Ofcom said Friday morning that it did not consider RT's licensee, ANO TV Novosti, ""fit and proper to hold a UK broadcast license."" The decision came amid 29 ongoing investigations into the impartiality of RT's news and current affairs coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  ""We consider the volume and potentially serious nature of the issues raised within such a short period to be of great concern — especially given RT's compliance history, which has seen the channel fined £200,000 for previous due impartiality breaches,"" Ofcom said in a statement.  These concerns prompted Ofcom to launch a separate investigation into whether ANO TV Novosti should retain its license.  ""This investigation has taken account of a number of factors, including RT's relationship with the Russian Federation,"" Ofcom said. ""[The investigation] has recognized that RT is funded by the Russian state, which has recently invaded a neighboring sovereign country.""  The organization also said it had considered the new laws in Russia which ""effectively criminalize any independent journalism that departs from the Russian state's own news narrative, in particular in relation to the invasion of Ukraine.""  ""We consider that given these constraints it appears impossible for RT to comply with the due impartiality rules of our Broadcasting Code in the circumstances,"" Ofcom concluded.  RT is currently off-air in the U.K. after EU sanctions disrupted its broadcast feed to Britain.  Anna Belkina, deputy editor in chief of RT, told CNBC in an emailed statement that Ofcom's decision painted the regulator as ""nothing more than a tool of government.""  ""By ignoring RT's completely clean record of four consecutive years and stating purely political reasons tied directly to the situation in Ukraine, Ofcom has falsely judged RT to not be 'fit and proper' and in doing so robbed the UK public of access to information,"" Belkina said.  — Chloe Taylor  CNBC's Silvia Amaro reports from Estonia's Tapa military base — around 70 miles from the Russian border — where troops from NATO countries have been deployed in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.  — Chloe Taylor  Nine humanitarian corridors will be opened in Ukraine on Friday to allow the evacuation of civilians and the import of vital supplies, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk has announced.  The plans for Friday include routes out of Mariupol, Sumy, and the villages of Krasnopillia and Velyka Pysarivka.  Vereshchuk said authorities were working on arranging humanitarian help for the Kherson region. Kherson, a key city in southern Ukraine, became the first major Ukrainian city to be captured by Russian forces earlier this month.  Residents of the city have since taken to the streets on several occasions to protest the Russian occupation.  — Chloe Taylor  Ukraine's State Emergency Services have said one person was killed this morning in an airstrike on Kyiv.  A fire broke out in a five-story apartment block in the capital's Podil district, the SES said, after the building was hit by a rocket.  — Chloe Taylor  — Chloe Taylor  Several missiles hit an aircraft repair center on the outskirts of Lviv, western Ukraine, the city's mayor said Friday.  The attack suggests Russian forces are continuing to widen their attack. Many Ukrainians have fled their homes elsewhere in the country to the relative safety of Lviv. The city's mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, has had to take action to stop landlords raising their rents as refugees flood into the city.  In a series of Telegram posts Friday morning, Sadovyi said Russian missiles had hit the area near Lviv airport.  ""Several missiles hit the aircraft repair plant. Its buildings were destroyed by the blows,"" he said, according to an NBC News translation. ""The active work of the plant was stopped in advance, so there are no casualties now. Rescuers and relevant utilities are working on the site.""  He also clarified that the airport itself had not been hit.  NBC reporters on the ground in Lviv said an air alarm sounded in the city just after 6 a.m. local time, and three explosions were heard from the outskirts of the city at around 6:25 a.m.  — Chloe Taylor  You can read Thursday's live coverage here:   Pentagon says there was 24-hour period with no shelling observed in Ukraine; U.S. accuses Russia of war crimes  Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden are set to speak Friday evening Beijing time, Chinese state media announced Thursday.

Even Qin Gang, China's ambassador to the U.S., said up front in a op-ed in the Washington Post on Wednesday that the conflict is not good for China, and Beijing would have tried to prevent it if they had known ahead of time.

St. Louis Fed's Bullard says the central bank should raise rates above 3% this year,2022-03-18 12:52:45+00:00,"St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday he thinks the central bank should raise interest rates the equivalent of 12 times this year to convince the public it is serious about fighting inflation.  As the lone dissenter at this week's Federal Reserve meeting, Bullard said in a statement that he would like to see the central bank's benchmark interest rate boosted above 3% from the near-0% level where it had stood.  ""This would quickly adjust the policy rate to a more appropriate level for the current circumstances,"" he said.  Following its two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday said it would raise overnight rates for banks by 0.25 percentage point, historically the typical increment with which the FOMC moves. Accompanying economic projections indicated a path this year that would see the equivalent of seven rate hikes, or 1.75 percentage points.  The move was the first time the Fed has raised the rate since December 2018 and came in response to a stunning increase in inflation that has seen prices rise at their fastest pace in 40 years.  Bullard was the only FOMC member to vote against the move, stating he would have preferred a rate hike of 0.5 percentage point, or 50 basis points. He added the Fed also should have started the process of reducing the nearly $9 trillion in bond holdings it has accumulated over the past 14 years.  In his statement Friday, Bullard said inflation is hurting people the Fed is trying to help the most, namely those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.  ""The burden of excessive inflation is particularly heavy for people with modest incomes and wealth and for those with limited ability to adjust to a rising cost of living,"" he said. ""The combination of strong real economic performance and unexpectedly high inflation means that the Committee's policy rate is currently far too low to prudently manage the U.S. macroeconomic situation.""  Fed officials overall were divided on how to proceed with rates this year.  Ten members penciled in a fed funds rate of 1.75%-2% by year's end, but eight said it should be higher. The highest ""dot"" on the committee's dot plot, presumably Bullard's, indicated a range of 3%-3.25%.  He pointed out that the Fed has moved that aggressively before, in 1994-95 to combat a revving economy and a gradual rise in inflation.  ""The results were excellent,"" Bullard said. ""The Committee achieved 2% inflation on average and the U.S. economy boomed during the second half of the 1990s. I think the Committee should try to achieve a similar outcome in the current environment.""  On the issue of the Fed's balance sheet, Bullard did not provide details of what he thinks the central bank should do, saying only that ""a plan"" at this week's meeting would have been appropriate.  The post-meeting statement indicated that the committee ""expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting."" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said afterward that the process could begin as soon as May. "
Here's what Chinese state media is saying ahead of Xi's call with Biden,2022-03-18 07:14:15+00:00,"BEIJING — While Chinese state media have tacked away from primarily pro-Russian coverage of the war in Ukraine, one of the consistent messages remains: Blame the U.S.  Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden are scheduled to speak Friday evening Beijing time about bilateral relations and ""issues of common concern,"" Chinese state media announced late Thursday.  The call would mark the first official contact between the U.S. and Chinese presidents since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.  Much of Chinese state media coverage since has focused on negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, without describing the conflict as an invasion or war. China's foreign ministry has refused to call Russia's attack on Ukraine an invasion, while blaming the U.S. for ""fueling"" the tensions.  That criticism has persisted.  People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, put a headline about the upcoming Xi-Biden call in a prominent, bolded spot on the right side of its website's front page on Friday.  Several lines below it was a piece from the editorial board: ""Sticking to 'double standards' will only bankrupt U.S. credibility,"" the headline said, according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese text.  In a nightly news show Thursday, China's state television broadcaster noted the U.S. plans to send $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, and included clips of Putin blaming Western nations for global inflation.  The show closed by citing unnamed analysts warning that the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in a period of high inflation and uncertainty only adds to the risk of global debt default.  As is the case with most Chinese state media, the half-hour news broadcast focused mostly on domestic affairs, including China's own ability to control the recent Covid-19 outbreak.  State media announcements on the Xi-Biden call did not specifically mention Ukraine, while the White House announcement included it as a planned topic of discussion.  Readouts of contact between high-level U.S. and Chinese officials have tended to separate U.S.-China relations from the two countries' discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized last week how China's relationship with Russia was as solid as when Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin met and issued a joint statement in early February.  Beijing has tried to portray itself as maintaining a relationship with Russia while working with European countries and other nations to broker peace, especially in the face of increased sanctions on Russia by the U.S., EU and other countries.  ""Beijing's support for Moscow is mostly rhetorical,"" consulting firm Teneo said in a report released March 10.  On Friday, Gabriel Wildau, senior vice president at Teneo, noted a change in that rhetoric. ""In the last few days there are signs of a shift in state media coverage, which may reflect Beijing's attempt to distance itself from Moscow.""  He pointed to how China's English-language state television broadcaster has highlighted civilian casualties from Russian attacks, and the Chinese-language one has reported the Ukrainian military's battlefield successes.  That reflects further detail than Chinese official media have offered in the past on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. As of Wednesday, at least 780 civilians have been killed — including 58 children — since Russia's attack began on Feb. 24, according to United Nations data.  Last week Beijing announced a ""six-point initiative"" for preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, and Premier Li Keqiang said China is ""deeply concerned"" about the situation in Ukraine.  Chinese media's slight shift away from primarily Moscow messaging has also targeted a U.S. audience.  In an op-ed published in the Washington Post on Wednesday in English, Qin Gang, China's ambassador to the U.S. said ""assertions that China knew about, acquiesced to or tacitly supported this war are purely disinformation.""  Morgan Stanley says these Chinese stocks could rebound — Alibaba, Tencent aren't on the list  Wall Street banks name their favorite Asia stocks — and Citi says one could have upside of 167%  Xpeng and more: Morgan Stanley says these stocks will benefit from rising oil prices  Most prominently, The New York Times early on March 3 Beijing time cited U.S. and European officials as saying senior Chinese officials told their Russian counterparts in early February not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing that month.  Qin said Wednesday there were more than 6,000 Chinese citizens in Ukraine.  ""Conflict between Russia and Ukraine does no good for China,"" he said. ""Had China known about the imminent crisis, we would have tried our best to prevent it.""  Macquarie and Morgan Stanley analysts cited the op-ed as a contributing factor to Wednesday's rally in Hong Kong and mainland Chinese stocks. "
Russia's Putin may launch false flag in Moldova as Europe war wages on,2022-03-18 22:10:47+00:00,"Three weeks into the war in Ukraine, as Russia faces staunch and seemingly unexpected resistance on the ground, analysts have warned that President Vladimir Putin may be considering his next target: Moldova.  A landlocked Eastern European country situated on Ukraine's western border, Moldova shares several parallels with its neighbor that could see it become a staging post for the continued onslaught — or itself vulnerable to attack.  ""If the conflict escalates beyond Ukraine, Moldova is one of the places that ranks highest on the list,"" Adriano Bosoni, director of analysis at risk management firm Rane, told CNBC.  Moldova, like Ukraine, is not part of the European Union, nor is it a member of NATO — though it has ambitions to join both. But, like Ukraine, the former Soviet republic is home to a sizeable pro-Russian separatist population based primarily in the breakaway state of Transnistria on the Ukrainian border.  Governed by its own Kremlin-backed leader, Transnistria could present a strategic opportunity for Russia, which has already amassed some 1,500 troops in the area.  Either Putin could recognize it as an independent state — as he did with Donetsk and Luhansk before launching a full-blown invasion of Ukraine — or it could become the focus point of a so-called false flag event, manufactured by Russia to justify an intervention.  ""To me, it's super interesting that Russia has not yet recognized Transnistria as an independent republic the same way that it did with Luhansk and Donetsk,"" said Bosoni.  ""If we saw Russia do that, it would be a serious indication that they are thinking of taking the conflict to Moldova.""  The Russian Embassies in London and Washington as well as the Russian Foreign Ministry did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment.  There are currently no definitive signs that Putin is planning such a strategy in Moldova, according to Bosoni, who described it as a ""low probability, high risk situation."" Precursors could include Russia denouncing the country's pro-European government, as well as broader destabilization efforts and campaigns to undermine authorities.  However, if Russia were to take that path, it would spell further hardship, not least for Moldova's 2.6 million residents and the 350,000 migrants from Ukraine who have fled there.  ""They would be very weak. There would be little to no resistance,"" said Clinton Watts, a research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, of Moldova's resistance. The country — one of Europe's poorest on a GDP per capita basis — has much less military capability than Ukraine.  An invasion of Moldova could therefore open a back door into southwest Ukraine, said Watts, noting that Putin may be looking for an alternate game plan given Russia's as-yet failed efforts to encircle the capital Kyiv.  ""They may hold out [on Kyiv] and try to circle in on Odesa first,"" he said, referring to the port city in south Ukraine. Russia may then try to seize the south of the country, having already closed in on Mykolaiv, 130 kilometers (81 miles) to Odesa's east.  ""I think it's more likely that he wants to take southern Ukraine and reunite with it Transnistria, using that as a launching pad to take Moldova,"" Watts added.  If that were to happen, Moldova could face a fate similar to that of Ukraine, locked in conflict with a global superpower while Western allies watch from the sidelines.  ""In this region now there is no possibility for us to feel safe,"" the country's president, Maia Sandu, said earlier this month during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  At the time, Blinken pledged America's support for the small republic, which days earlier applied for fast-track EU membership. But without being an EU or NATO member, neither organization is likely to help substantially.  ""Blinken says that the U.S. has Moldova's back. It does not mean that they would back it,"" said Bosoni.  Critically, that is what sets Moldova apart from other former Soviet nations, such as the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, all of which have expressed national security concerns amid heightened threats from their Russian neighbor. All three are members of the EU and NATO, suggesting allies would step in in the event of a Russian invasion.  And that leaves Moldova in a precarious position if Russia makes it its next target.  ""It might not be in 48 hours. It might be 48 months from now,"" said Watts.  Correction: The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. An earlier version misstated the location. "

Dow rallies more than 270 points Friday as stocks post their best week since 2020,2022-03-18 22:00:35+00:00,"Stocks climbed on Friday as the major averages notched their best week in more than a year.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 274.17 points, or 0.8%, for the fifth day in a row to 34,754.93. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% to reach 4,463.12, and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.05%, ending at 13,893.84. Both indexes surged for a fourth consecutive day. All of the major averages finished their best week since November 2020.  Stocks are coming off a massive surge that resulted in the S&P 500 notching a 6.1% gain for the week. The Dow ended the week 5.5% higher, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 8.1%.  Investors continued to digest news from the Federal Reserve earlier this week, as well as a rise in Covid cases in Europe stemming from an emerging subvariant and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.  ""The worst thing about any crisis is when it first hits out of left field, it creates nothing but uncertainty.

""But after you've had some time to vet it [you see] the market is suggesting that they're starting to feel a little better, that there's some direction of this thing... It does seem like the economic fallout will not be nearly as detrimental as it looked going in.""  President Joe Biden spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Xi told Biden that the United States and China each had an obligation to promote peace. Russia has made requests for military or economic aid from China and the call was seen as a critical test of whether Biden can convince Beijing to stay on the sidelines of the conflict.  Several missiles hit an aircraft repair center on the outskirts Lviv in western Ukraine. A Ukrainian official also said one person was killed in an airstrike that hit Kyiv. (Click here for live updates.)  Russia on Thursday reportedly made a $117 million bond payment in dollars, thereby avoiding what would be a historic foreign currency debt default. Stocks extended their gains following the report. Bloomberg reported Friday that clearing houses in Europe and the U.S. have processed the payment.  Investors were also assessing their own risk appetite. The week's big gains came with a side of volatility, which shows no signs of tempering anytime soon.  ""For 2022, volatility is going to be the investor narrative,"" Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments, told CNBC. ""We would normally feel much more bullish around any single factor having a good ability to level the volatility, but given this unprecedented level of very significant factors that could drive the markets one way or another, we don't see volatility normalizing over the next couple of months.""

The Fed also raised rates for the first time since 2018 on Wednesday.  On Friday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" the central bank may need to enact one or more 50 basis point interest rate hikes this year in order to tame ""raging"" inflation.  ""Fortunately, investor expectations for inflation over the next five years was brought down quite a bit, which, if sustained, will continue [to] be helpful for the Fed and the markets despite somewhat higher interest rates,"" said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management.

Xpeng hikes price of electric cars after Tesla as material costs rise,2022-03-18 11:33:15+00:00,"Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng will hike the price of its cars citing a sharp rise in the cost of raw materials.  Xpeng said from Mar. 21, price increases on its vehicles will range from 10,100 Chinese yuan ($1,587) to 20,000 yuan before subsidies. The company did not give a breakdown of the specific price rises for each of its models.  Xpeng currently sells the flagship P7 sedan, the P5 sedan and the G3 sports utility vehicle. It is gearing up to launch the G9 SUV later this year.  Electric carmakers have been struggling with rising costs of raw materials such as nickel, which is a key component of batteries. Other components such as semiconductors continue to be in short supply, providing another headwind for Xpeng and its rivals such as Nio.  Xpeng is not the first electric vehicle company to raise prices. Over the last week, Tesla has done several price hikes across various models of its cars.  Earlier this week, Warren Buffett-backed automaker BYD also raised the prices of its new energy vehicles, which includes electric cars. "
Nickel falls 12% to hit limit down again on London Metal Exchange,2022-03-18 08:27:17+00:00,"LONDON — The benchmark three-month nickel contract fell 12% on Friday morning to hit a new trading limit, as heavy selling continued on international metal markets.  The price hit $36,915 a metric ton as it opened for trade, according to Refinitiv data. The 145-year-old exchange, which still has some open outcry trading, has had a wild two weeks with price surges, technical glitches and trading suspensions.  On March 8, nickel prices more than doubled in a matter of hours, climbing above $100,000 a metric ton as one of the world's top producers, China's Tsingshan Holding Group, bought large amounts to reduce its short bets on the metal. Trading had to be halted as the move exacerbated a price rally at a time when metals were already spiraling upward on Russia's intensifying conflict in Ukraine.  Then on Wednesday, the LME attempted to resume nickel trading after the rare shut down. But a ""systems error"" allowed a small number of trades to go through below the newly imposed daily price limit, and the exchange was temporarily halted once again.  The LME installed a trading range of 5% on Wednesday which was widened to 8% for Thursday, and then 12% for Friday.  Speaking before the open on Wednesday, Matthew Chamberlain, CEO of the LME, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" that the exchange was ""absolutely mindful of the impact that this has had on so many people and we need to make sure that it doesn't happen again.""  Chamberlain said the LME had ""deliberately prioritized stability"" by setting a relatively narrow range of daily trading limits, but these could soon be widened if the exchange observed a ""more orderly market.""  Commodity prices have jumped on supply fears related to Russia's onslaught of Ukraine, with the ongoing war and an array of Western sanctions raising disruption fears. Alongside energy, Russia is a key producer and exporter of metals and grains. Indeed, Russia is the world's third-largest producer of nickel — a key ingredient in stainless steel and a major component in lithium-ion batteries.  —CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this article.

Apple Mac Studio and Studio Display review,2022-03-17 13:34:05+00:00,"Apple's new Mac Studio computer goes on sale on Friday. I've been testing it for over a week, and it's a good pick for video and photo professionals for whom cost is no issue and who want a Mac desktop that will be able to handle anything thrown at it for years. But, with a starting price of $1,999 that doesn't include a screen, it's not the computer for people who just want to browse the web and watch Netflix. They're better served by the $699 Mac Mini.  The Mac Studio comes as Apple's Mac business soars thanks to Apple's powerful M1 chips. Mac sales were up 23% in 2021, to $35 billion, for example, and 36% from 2019, the year before Apple started its transition away from Intel.  I tested the Mac Studio with Apple's new 27-inch $1,599 Studio Display, which also goes on sale Friday. It's the first consumer-oriented screen from Apple since the Thunderbolt Display, which was introduced in 2011 and discontinued in 2016. And, combined, you can think of the Studio Display and the Mac Studio as a replacement for the iMac Pro, which Apple stopped selling last year.  Here's what you need to know.  The Mac Studio has an excellent, compact design. It's focused on practicality with plenty of ports to plug anything in. It's shaped like an aluminum brick, measuring about 8 inches per side and 4 inches tall, elegantly elevated a few millimeters off the desktop for ventilation. I tested the model with Apple's M1 Max chip, the second-fastest processor Apple makes.  Unlike Apple's laptops before last year's models, it has plenty of practical ports: two USB-C ports and a reader for SD memory cards like cameras use on the front, and four USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and an Ethernet and HDMI port on the back. Most people will be able to connect anything to it without a dongle.  But the selling point for Mac Studio is not its design: It's the speed, and in particular, the performance of its Apple silicon chip.  I tested a $3,199 version of the Mac Studio with 64 gigabytes of RAM and 2 terabytes of storage space powered by an M1 Max processor with a 10-core CPU and a 32-core GPU. Upgraded versions can include an even more powerful M1 Ultra chip.  I was able to load and edit high-resolution video in Final Cut Pro quickly and could instantly batch edit dozens of photos in Lightroom. It can render complicated 3D environments and images, in professional apps such as Houdini FX, which requires more performance than 2D video. Everything was speedy, and I'm confident the chip can perform this kind of work for years.  And it does all this quietly. Over half of the computer's internal volume is taken up by an internal heat sink so that the computer runs quietly without spinning its fans. I never heard the fans while testing.  I didn't need the more powerful chip for my workflows, and neither will users who primarily use their computers to send emails, browse the web and watch movies. So, unless you want the fastest computer for bragging rights or you're designing 3D movies for work, consider the regular Mac Mini for $699 instead.  Let's talk a bit about the Studio Display, which I used with the Mac Studio.  It's a good-looking screen with an aluminum exterior, squared-off angles and a thin black bezel. Its base and footprint are compact given the 27-inch size. I liked that I could easily disconnect it from the Mac Studio and connect it to my work MacBook Pro through a single USB-C cord. It's seamless. With one USB-C cord, I could charge my laptop, work on a bigger screen and access Apple's built-in cameras and speakers.  The picture quality on the Studio Display is good, but it won't blow you away. I like that text is nice and sharp thanks to the extra pixels, so people who read on their computer for hours per day might want to consider it. And while it might seem expensive, it's a lot less than the Pro Display XDR Apple also sells, which costs $4,999 before you add in the $1,000 stand. That's for video professionals who need a bigger, brighter, 32-inch screen and more accurate colors for work.  The front-facing camera on Studio Display is outstanding, thanks to the 12-megapixel sensor, which is a much higher resolution than the 720p built-in camera on my 2018 Apple MacBook. I like that the wide lens captures a lot of the scene around me and that it includes three microphones, which helped me sound clear on video calls.  It was easy to see the difference in Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Cisco Webex meetings. My image was clearer and brighter than before, with less low-light noise. I was impressed by Apple's Center Stage feature, which automatically moves the monitor's camera so I remain in the frame even as I fidget.  The six-speaker setup is also excellent, although audiophiles will still likely opt for separate studio monitors or headphones. But the built-in speakers are good enough to listen to rock or pop music and more than sufficient for watching movies. Many monitors don't have built-in speakers or webcams, so both are a nice touch.  The Mac Studio is not user-upgradable. Apple says it is ""modular,"" which refers to the fact that the screen isn't built-in. But that means power users can't add additional RAM, graphics cards or storage space, unlike on high-end Windows desktops.  It also means any upgrades you want have to be made at the time of purchase, including $400 for additional RAM and as much as $2,400 for 8 terabytes of storage. Those are pricey additions to an already expensive computer.  There's a headphone jack on the back of the Mac Studio, but it'd be more convenient if it was right on the front alongside the USB ports.  And while there's plenty of graphics power for editing videos and photos, gamers who want the latest titles should consider a Windows gaming PC instead, since most new games that take advantage of beefy CPUs and GPUs, such as the recent hit ""Elden Ring,"" simply aren't available for the Mac.  And, of course, you need to buy a monitor for it. And there are some downsides to the Studio Display, too.  I found myself wishing that the Studio Display had more distinguishing features. Apple says it's powered by an iPhone chip, but it doesn't have an interface or other common monitor features, such as the ability to switch between inputs without plugging and unplugging cords. You can't display inputs from multiple computers in split-screen, either, and it doesn't let you stream media or act as a wireless speaker like some other displays.  It also doesn't support high refresh rates, which makes scrolling smoother and is important for gamers. Apple has started to include the feature on its phones, laptops and tablets under the marketing name ""ProMotion,"" so it may become a standard Apple feature during the lifetime of the Studio Display, but as it stands the monitor is less ""future-proof."" For most people, this won't be a deal-breaker.  The screen might be too small for some people who have gotten used to massive screens. I use a 32-inch Dell UltraSharp widescreen curved monitor at work. The Studio Display looked small when I first plugged it in, and I found myself missing the curve on my work monitor.  But there aren't many options if you need the 5K resolution. The $1,299 5K LG Ultrafine — now discontinued at Apple stores — is $300 less. It's the same size and resolution, but it's not made by Apple and the speakers and webcam are worse.  The new products are the culmination of a Mac revival that started over five years ago. In 2017, Apple said that it had formed a new internal group to address the issues that artists, creatives and computer scientists had raised with the state of Apple's high-end desktop computers, which were rarely updated and languishing at the time.  It's strategic for Apple, even if it sells four laptops for every desktop, as company officials said in 2018. Creative professionals, who have historically preferred Mac computers over Windows, need options on the high end that can support computationally intensive work such as video editing or 3D rendering. In exchange, Apple stays relevant to highly skilled talent and gets a marketing boost from impressive artists using its products.  The key to the transition was Apple's move to dump Intel chips for its own silicon. Apple has succeeded here — I do not recommend Macs with an Intel processor, such as the Mac Pro or some Mac Mini models, because they are getting dated and won't last as long.  The Mac Studio is a new slot in Apple's lineup for creative pros who are charging the computer to their company, or for people who want the fastest Mac available and don't care how much it costs. Reminder, you're spending $1,999 before you even add in the $1,599 screen. Combined, you're spending $3,598 before taxes. But you know what you're getting if you spend that much, and I think you'll like it.  More cost-sensitive buyers who don't need all the power of the Mac Studio should consider a Mac Mini if they need a desktop computer, or a MacBook Air laptop, which is more portable and can easily power a desktop experience with a compatible monitor, such as the Studio Display, which is a solid option if you want a 5K screen with good speakers and a great webcam.

"Maserati to go all electric starting with 1,200 horsepower GranTurismo",2022-03-18 01:55:45+00:00,"DETROIT — Luxury auto brand Maserati plans to offer electric versions of its entire lineup by 2025, starting next year with a new GranTurismo EV featuring more than 1,200 horsepower, the company said Thursday.  The GranTurismo ""Folgore"" will be the first all-electric vehicle for the famed Italian brand, which is owned by Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler. It's expected to have a top speed of nearly 190 mph and achieve 0-62 mph in under three seconds, the company said.  After the GranTurismo, Maserati will introduce the all-electric Grecale midsize SUV and a Grancabrio GT car. By 2025, Maserati also plans to add electric versions of its MC20 supercar, Quattroporte sedan and Levante SUV.  Maserati CEO Davide Grasso on Thursday described the EV transformation, including its target of going totally electric by 2030, as a ""defining moment"" for the more than century-old automaker.  Nearly all major automakers, specifically luxury ones such as Maserati, have announced plans for EVs to represent a majority, if not all, of their sales by 2030.  Preview images of the electric GranTurismo released Thursday showed a smooth exterior design for the four-seat coupe.  Maserati did not release expected pricing for the new EVs. Its current traditional models range from about $78,000 to more than $200,000.

Why Warren Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway will never split its stock,2022-03-18 02:01:47+00:00,"Class A shares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway closed above $500,000 a share on Wednesday, setting a new high-water mark for the stock.  It was the first time the shares have ever closed above half a million dollars, and helped push the company's market cap above $730 billion. It is now the No. 6 most valuable company in the U.S.  Berkshire Hathaway's class A shares have long been one of the most expensive single stocks investors could buy, and as a result, investors have repeatedly asked Buffett about a potential stock split, which is when a company divides up its shares to lower their price and increase the overall amount of shares available.  In response, Berkshire introduced cheaper class B shares in 1996, priced at a substantially more affordable $341 as of Thursday afternoon, but has consistently refused to split the company's original class A offering.  It is because of this refusal, not in spite of it, that the company has had such a strong track record in growing its value, Buffett has argued.  At the 1995 annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder's meeting Buffett acknowledged that having such a high-priced stock — at the time, it was trading around $25,000 per share — could be ""anywhere from awkward to disadvantageous"" for investors, especially when it comes to gifting shares. But he said that the barrier to entry was intentional.  Goldman says retail investors are buying this market dip. Here are their favorite stocks  Sell Citigroup as stock is unlikely to go up much from current levels, Morgan Stanley says  These global stocks are long-term outperformers with healthy dividends, Barclays says  JPMorgan's Kolanovic says U.S. recession is unlikely, even as bond market flashes warning signals  ""We want to attract shareholders who are as investment-oriented as we can possibly obtain, with as long-term horizons,"" he said. If Berkshire were to split the stock and lower its price, ""we would get a shareholder base that would not have the level of sophistication and the synchronization of objectives with us that we have now.""  There are just over 615,000 class A shares outstanding, compared to roughly 1.3 billion outstanding class B shares.  Buffett added that he saw no incentive in having a cheaper stock that has more volatility if it isn't creating ""intrinsic value"" for investors. ""There are a lot of people that are attracted to stocks that are going upward. It doesn't attract us,"" he said. ""We don't care to have it sell higher, except as intrinsic value grows.""  As recently as 2011, Buffett's long time right hand man Charlie Munger said that Buffett had a joke he liked repeating to his aging friends: ""May you live until the A stock splits.""  There have been a number of high-profile stock splits in recent years, with Amazon and Google parent Alphabet both announcing 20-for-1 splits of their shares once they topped $3,000 each earlier this year. Those announcements followed Apple and Tesla, which in in 2020 both split their stocks as their valuations skyrocketed.

"Porsche increases EV targets, confirms 911 hybrid sports car",2022-03-18 09:10:29+00:00,"DETROIT – As the all-electric Porsche Taycan sedan outsells the German carmaker's iconic 911 sports car, the company is increasing its EV sales targets. It also plans to roll out a hybrid version of the 911.  Porsche on Friday announced it expects 80% of its global sales to be all-electric vehicles by 2030. That compares with previous plans for that amount of sales to be a mix of all-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which include internal combustion engines with battery technologies.  ""The future of Porsche is electric,"" Porsche CEO Oliver Blume told media during a roundtable.  Blume declined to predict the breakdown of the non-all-electric vehicles, citing a ""flexible engine strategy"" that could include internal combustion engines, hybrids and plug-in hybrids.  The Taycan is Porsche's first and only all-electric car so far. It represented about 14% of the company's 301,915 vehicles sold in 2021. Taycan sales were 41,296, topping record sales of the 911 at 38,464 units.  The company's next two EVs are expected to be the Macan SUV in 2023, followed by the 718 sports car by 2025. Blume also confirmed a hybrid version of its 911 sports car is coming, but he did not disclose a timeframe for its release.  Porsche reports nearly 40% of Porsche vehicles sold in Europe were all-electric or plug-in hybrids vehicles, or PHEVs. Porsche currently offers two PHEVs, which are viewed by many as a short-term, transitional technology before all-electric vehicles.  Porsche's plans are unique among global carmakers in the fact that it doesn't plan to completely give up on vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines. Specifically, for its 911 sports car, which is considered among the best ""driver's cars"" in the world.  Porsche announced a roughly $24 million investment in the development of ""e-fuels,"" which officials say is a climate-neutral fuel to replace gasoline in nonelectric vehicles.  Wall Street banks pick their top semiconductor stocks as electric vehicle production soars  Forget Tesla — this auto stock is the one to buy right now, analyst says  Europe's moving away from Russian energy — and that could boost EV charging stocks  Blume described e-fuels as ""an ideal complement"" to EVs.  The new EV plans were announced in connection to Porsche, which announced a preliminary agreement last month to be spun off from VW into a public company, announcing its 2021 financial results.  Porsche reported new records in both sales revenue and operating profit. Sales in 2021 were 33.1 billion euros ($36.7 billion), up 4.4 billion euros ($4.9 billion) from 2020. Porsche's operating profit last year increased by 27% to 5.3 billion euros ($5.9 billion) compared to 2020. "
"Investor behavior in Europe is mirroring the market's worst crises, new research shows",2022-03-18 14:01:59+00:00,"LONDON — European fund flow patterns so far this year are emulating historical crisis periods for markets, including the 2008 global financial cash, according to new research from data firm Refinitiv.  A sluggish market environment, lingering concerns around the Covid-19 pandemic and the emerging geopolitical tensions in Europe meant the continent's fund industry saw net outflows in February that took overall flows so far this year to -57.2 billion euros (-$63.2 billion), according to the research.  Mutual funds — pools from investors allocated by fund managers into stocks, bonds, money market instruments and other securities — faced 67.6 billion euros of outflows in February alone. Meanwhile exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — baskets of securities that trade on regular stock exchanges — enjoyed inflows of 9.2 billion euros.  ""Within this market environment and given the economic uncertainties one would expect that European investors sold long-term funds and bought money market products,"" said Detlef Glow, head of Lipper EMEA research at Refinitiv.  ""Therefore, it is somewhat surprising that European investors sold money market products, which are normally considered safe-haven investments.""  The overall flow figures were heavily impacted by 49.4 billion of outflows from money market products — short-term debt investments — which meant that long-term funds actually only faced around 9 billion euros of outflows even in such a turbulent market environment. These money market products are cash-like funds with a low level of risk and usually offer investors high liquidity.  ""Nevertheless, it looks like European investors are taking rising interest rates — caused by the increased inflation rates around the globe — into consideration as they further sold bond products over the course of February,"" Glow added.  Over the first two months of the year, mutual funds have seen 91.9 billion euros of outflows while ETFs have taken inflows of 34.7 billion euros.  Glow highlighted that inflows into ETFs within this market environment repeat a trend that was witnessed during previous rough market periods, such as the financial crisis in 2008 or the euro sovereign debt crisis in 2011. In both instances, ETFs saw inflows while mutual funds endured massive outflows.  Refinitiv's analysis of the best- and worst-selling Lipper Global Classifications for February indicated that European investors were still in a ""risk-on mode"" despite the challenging market environment.  ""In more detail, European investors took positions in sectors that may offer diversification for their portfolio such as global equities or flexible mixed-assets products,"" Glow added.  ""A closer look at the best- and worst-selling Lipper Global Classifications for the first two months of 2022 makes it very clearly a trend that European investors have been selling some of their safe-haven investments while investing in funds that may offer diversification for their portfolio or are focused on single themes, sectors, and countries.""

Jim Cramer says investors should buy these 11 recently boosted dividend stocks,2022-03-18 10:48:42+00:00,"CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday offered investors a list of dividend stocks with yields that recently increased, that he believes buyers should add to their portfolio.  Dividends are a generally ""unassailable defense against a volatile market,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said, which means that they can be attractive additions to the portfolio of an investor worried about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, soaring inflation and Covid fears that have roiled the market in recent weeks.  ""You want bountiful dividends that are also safe, and the best way to determine a dividend's safety is by searching for the companies that have recently raised their payouts, because that's the ultimate sign of confidence in the future,"" Cramer said. ""Plus, with interest rates on the rise, only the dividend boosters can keep up with the bond market competition,"" he added.  To come up with his list, which he said are the ""biggest dividend raisers of 2022 so far,"" Cramer only included stocks which raised dividends this year by more than 20%. Using this criteria, he shrunk the list of hundreds of stocks listed in the S&P 500 to 27 names, then down to 11 stocks that he believes can outpace inflation and be attractive additions to buyer's portfolios.  Here is the list:  ""When the Fed is tightening to combat rampant inflation, I don't want you to overthink it — you want to circle the wagons around companies that are rapidly raising their dividends,"" Cramer said.

The 4 types of vacations that may be hard to book in 2022,2022-03-18 08:19:10+00:00,"After two years of living with Covid-19, travelers are making big vacation plans again.  But not every type of trip may be available this year, travel professionals said.  That's because many people postponed more ambitious vacations during the pandemic — in some cases two years in a row — leaving little room for new bookings this year.  Nearly half of those who had vacations canceled in 2020 and 2021 plan to take them this year, according to a survey by travel insurance firm Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection. Only 5.5% are pushing these plans to next year, and less than 4% plan to cancel altogether, according to the survey of more than 1,500 travelers.  In addition, people are taking longer trips and booking them further in advance. Some fall and winter holidays are already beginning to sell out, said Lee Thompson, co-founder of adventure travel company, Flash Pack.  But some trips may be fully booked long before then, like these four types of vacations that travel insiders say are filling fast for the summer.  Booking an African safari 12 to 18 months in advance could be the new norm, said Shannon Kircher, founder of the U.S.-based boutique travel firm Compass & Vine.  Many travelers dream about going on a safari, but don't pull the trigger because of the amount of planning and money that goes into it, said Kircher.  However, the pandemic has ""challenged our ideas of pushing off meaningful trips,"" she said. Plus, more people have the time and money to travel now, because of canceled trips from the past two years, she said.  For travelers easing back into the idea of international travel during the pandemic, the privacy and open-air nature of safaris are appealing, she said.  ""Safaris are inherently socially distanced — you're around more animals than humans generally,"" she said.  Travelers are choosing to visit East Africa from June through October as the period coincides with the great wildebeest migration, Kircher said, with many extending their trip to squeeze in a gorilla trekking experience or a post-safari beach escape.  Multiple locations in Hawaii are at risk of being without vacancies this summer, said Zander Buteux of home rental company VacationRenter.  ""If you wait until June to book for June travel, you will have slim pickings,"" he said. ""This is especially true for the key cities on each island such as Honolulu, Lahaina and Kihei.""  Two areas that still have a good amount of availability are O'ahu and Hanalei, said Buteux, though he doesn't expect things to stay this way.  Travel to Hawaii has been on the rise for the past eight months, said Buteux. Business is expected to pick up even more — along with prices — once the state lifts many of its pandemic travel restrictions this month, he said. Starting March 26, visitors from the continental United States will no longer be required to show their Covid-19 vaccination status or a negative pre-travel Covid-19 test to enter.  Summer isn't the only time of year that's being booked up fast, said Phil Jones, CEO of the luxury vacation home Pure Kauai. Easter and Christmas periods are also filling up, he said.    Like Buteux, he said: Once ""quarantine restrictions have been lifted, we predict a surge in bookings.""  Americans who are still hesitant about international travel are booking luxurious off-the-grid vacation spots in the country, said Kircher.  Some well-known ranches are booked more than a year in advance, she said.  The Ranch at Rock Creek in Montana is mostly booked until February 2023, and almost all weekend slots at Wyoming's Brush Creek Ranch are full, according to their online reservation systems.  ""For most people, the privacy and disconnected nature of dude ranches are appealing,"" Kircher said. Activities such as horseback riding, fly fishing and white water rafting are outdoors and naturally socially distanced.  Plus, visitors also get many of their needs taken care of as ""most of the high-end lodges are really all-inclusive, meaning food, drinks, and luxury amenities are included,"" she said.  Booking last-minute summer yacht charters is a thing of the past, said Tim Geisler, founder of Grenada-based sailing company, Nautilus Sailing.  Many destinations, especially in the Mediterranean, are selling out well ahead of time, he said.  Greece, Spain and the French island of Corsica are the most popular charter destinations in the Mediterranean now, he said.  ""We are noticing that things are starting to return to almost pre-pandemic levels,"" said Geisler, adding that ""80% of our charters are already booked out in Spain.""  Summer yachting trips to the Mediterranean are popular among Americans because they tend to avoid the Caribbean during this time, as it coincides with the area's hurricane season, he said.  The company is seeing an increase in bookings and inquiries from travelers who want to book trips nine to 12 months ahead of time, which limits inventory down the line, he said.  ""The later you make a reservation, the less choice you will have when it comes to yacht size, configuration and location, therefore it's best to book [at least] six months in advance,"" he said.  The company recently started operating in Croatia, said Geisler, adding that there is yacht availability there for the summer, but likely not for long.  The global yacht charter market, which was valued at $16.9 billion in 2021, is projected to reach $26.5 billion by 2027, with Europe being the top go-to destination in the summer months, according to the market research firm Mordor Intelligence.  — CNBC's Monica Pitrelli contributed to this report.

British fashion chain Ted Baker draws U.S. takeover interest,2022-03-18 10:46:14+00:00,"Sycamore Partners is in the early stage of making a possible cash offer for fashion retailer Ted Baker, the private equity firm said on Friday, in the latest sign of strong U.S. interest in taking over British entities.  New York-based Sycamore, which specializes in deals in the struggling retail sector, has until April 15 to make a firm offer for the London-listed Ted Baker. Sycamore said there was no certainty an offer would be made and did not disclose what the terms might be for any deal.  Ted Baker said it has not received an offer but would evaluate any proposal, although it was confident in its independent prospects.  Shares of the upmarket retailer jumped 20% on Friday but were still trading just above a pound each, compared with the nearly 30 pounds it was worth in 2015, giving it a current market valuation of nearly 220 million pounds ($289.26 million), Refinitiv Eikon data showed.  Takeover interest in British companies, ranging from defense groups to a leading supermarket, is its highest in years, as the pandemic and uncertainties linked to Britain's departure from the European Union have reduced valuations.  Ted Baker is in the middle of a three-year turnaround plan under boss Rachel Osborne as it tries to boost its online presence and rebuild its image after profit warnings and accounting issues.  Osborne took charge in 2019 in a management reshuffle that included the exit of former chief executive Ray Kelvin following allegations of inappropriate behavior. Kelvin has denied the allegations and retains a nearly 12% stake in the company he founded in 1988 in Glasgow.  Ted Baker, which has nearly 400 locations mostly in Europe, North America and the United Kingdom, said in February it was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the outlook for the current year as people slowly return to working in offices.

Why Russian people need tech companies to stay,2022-03-18 00:55:18+00:00,"As the U.S. and Europe impose economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, and businesses such as McDonald's and Starbucks shut down operations in the country, tech platforms must weigh a more complex equation.  Unlike certain sanctions or business closures made to primarily hurt the Russian regime, limiting access to tech platforms — whether by force or choice — could have massive effects on the Russian people and their ability to access reliable information that contradicts the Kremlin ""special military operation"" narrative.  ""I think tech companies are different from other companies doing business in Russia, because we do have a clear interest in having them stay,"" said Joanna Szostek, a political communication lecturer at the University of Glasgow. She praised Western companies in other industries for pulling their goods and services from Russia, but said it doesn't work the same way when it comes to services such as social media and search engines.  In many ways, the tech industry is facing a new version of the fundamental dilemma it's grappled with for years: the balance between connecting disparate parts of the world and risking the spread of disinformation.  Though some in Ukraine have called on tech companies to stop services in Russia to oppose the war, experts in internet freedom and Russian censorship say such action could be counterproductive. For truth to prevail inside Russia, platforms may have to take calculated risks to maintain their services in the country, experts say.  ""I think there's a very strong case for trying to do everything possible to keep those accessible for as long as possible,"" Szostek said. ""And if that means sort of continuing to do some kind of business in Russia, then so be it. Because, the idea of Russia getting completely trapped behind a sort of wall with no information at all getting through, I mean, it's quite terrifying really, how dark that place could become.""  Tech platforms operating in Russia are confronting a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, platforms such as Meta's Facebook and Instagram, Twitter, and Google's YouTube don't want to become vessels for Kremlin propaganda. But on the other, the absence of their services could leave an information vacuum likely to be filled by disinformation from the Russian government and state-owned media.  The situation these companies face is an iteration of the question they've struggled to answer in the wake of their growing power in the past few decades: Does the benefit of free and fast-spreading information outweigh the risk that their platforms can be used to disperse disinformation and stoke violence?  The same question has haunted the companies during times of democratic elections and social upheaval and throughout the pandemic.  This time, the conflict is also shedding light on just how valuable social media and internet access can be in the face of a repressive regime. Unlike in China, where Western social media companies largely don't operate within China's ""great firewall,"" platforms such as Facebook and Instagram do have a presence in Russia.  That's made their restriction by the Russian government significant, since those platforms have served as a way for Russian people to access the truth.  Ukraine's minister of digital transformation Mykhailo Fedorov has repeatedly called on tech platforms to end their business dealings in Russia. He's pleaded with top executives at Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others to suspend their services in Russia to isolate the country from major modern digital services.  ""The Ukrainians have also suggested that we remove access to Facebook and Instagram in Russia,"" Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, said on Twitter in February. ""However, people in Russia are using FB and IG to protest and organize against the war and as a source of independent information.""  ""We believe turning off our services would silence important expression at a crucial time,"" he added.  Some Western services have heeded calls to shut down business in Russia or blamed the potential risks of ongoing operations for their decisions to scale down. Two U.S. internet carriers, Lumen and Cogent, cut service to Russia in the wake of the war, citing security concerns and sanctions. Amazon Web Services said it would block new sign-ups from Russia, and other companies, such as Apple and Google, said they would stop sales in the country.  But internet freedom advocates and experts on Russia's digital landscape warn that some shutdowns could be counterproductive, cutting off average Russian people from truthful information that could stoke opposition to the Kremlin.  In a letter addressed to President Joe Biden, dozens of civil society groups cautioned against cutting off Russia from the internet. They asked that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control explicitly tell software and communications providers they will not violate sanctions by continuing their service in Russia by issuing a general license. They suggested that some voluntary decisions to cut internet services to Russia could be motivated by an attempt to avoid sanctions.  ""Overly broad restrictions on the access of the Russian people to the internet would further isolate the embattled pro-democracy and anti-war activists, and impede the ability of NGOs, human rights groups, journalists, and attorneys inside and outside Russia to provide critical information to citizens about the current state of affairs and their rights,"" the groups wrote. ""These actions would inadvertently speed up what the Kremlin has set out to achieve through its 'sovereign internet' tools — a complete and total control of information space inside Russia.""  Adrian Shahbaz, director of technology and democracy for nonpartisan advocacy group Freedom House, which signed the letter, said tech platforms should decide how to handle the balance ""on a case-by-case basis through consultation with experts from civil society."" Tech platforms must understand how their actions can impact human rights, he said.  Tech companies should consider the least harmful way they could comply with government requests if doing so is necessary to maintaining service in the country, Shahbaz said. For example, a platform asked to remove a certain post could consider doing so only from that particular jurisdiction, so it could still be accessible via a virtual private network, or VPN.  Andrew Sullivan, CEO of the nonprofit Internet Society, said he is skeptical of even well-intentioned restrictions on the internet, warning that those with resources are often able to find ways around such limits.  ""That's always the danger, but it's a really big danger with the internet because the advantages are already stacked in favor of the people who are in control,"" he said.  Some internet companies — such as Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — have committed to trying to keep their services as open in Russia as possible. But that also means making tough calls about what compromises are needed to ensure continued service. When Meta refused to stop labeling state-owned media and fact-checking their content, according to the company, Russian censors restricted Facebook and later Instagram.  ""Facebook would probably not have been banned right away ... if they stopped fact-checking Russian state-controlled media,"" said Yevgeniy Golovchenko, a disinformation and censorship researcher at the University of Copenhagen. ""But the question is, now that you show the Russian government that they can push Western media to do what Russian authorities want, what will be the next request?""  Golovchenko envisions two possible and opposite outcomes if Western social media were to disappear from Russia all at once. The optimistic view is that Russian people would take the mass exit as a sign that something is wrong and that they should dig deeper into what's happening outside their country. The pessimistic take is that it could further entrench Russian state-owned TV networks, where many Russians already get their news.  Still, there could be cases where some may consider it preferable to scale back on certain information altogether. Lev Gershenzon, former news director of Russian search engine Yandex, publicly called on the company's current executives to remove or change its top news feature on the home page so it would no longer present a watered-down version of the conflict in Ukraine. He suggested that if executives couldn't change the content, removing it altogether would be better than leaving it up.  ""I'm pretty sure that no information in this situation is better than some information,"" he said in an interview. ""If some tens of millions of people suddenly notice that there is no news block on the main page of their most visited portal, some of them, hopefully, would start asking some questions.""  The Russian government has been laying the groundwork for a broader crackdown on internet platforms for years. But unlike China, it doesn't have the same closed infrastructure that could lead to a swift clampdown.  ""Technically, it's very, very similar to other parts of the internet, whereas China is not,"" Sullivan said. That makes it technically more difficult for Russia to block access to certain parts of the web, he said.  At the same time, Russia does not have sufficient alternatives to many popular social media and messaging services, which could be part of the reason it's continued to allow access to services such as Meta's WhatsApp and Google's YouTube, while restricting Facebook, for example, for which a Russian alternative does exist.  There are two reasons that make it difficult for the Russian government to ban certain popular services, according to Marielle Wijermars, assistant professor of cybersecurity and politics at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. First, the Russian government uses platforms such as YouTube to disseminate its own propaganda. And second, it monitors social media platforms for signals about sensitive topics and potential unrest.  Blocking access to a popular service also risks generating a backlash, which means the government must believe the benefits outweigh the risks in doing so, Wijermars said.  She pointed to the Russian government's decision in 2018 to block Telegram, which it reversed just a couple of years later after users found it was easy to circumvent the ban on the popular messaging app. The measure also angered many users in Russia. Banning other services risks doing the same and could impact businesses that rely on platforms such as Instagram to sell or advertise their goods.  YouTube is among the most popular social media platforms in Russia, making the question of whether the government will move to ban it especially significant.  ""There's been a calculation that no leader wants to be the one responsible for blocking access to tools that millions of their supporters use,"" Shahbaz said.  There are still ways to get around censorship rules in Russia, especially because its infrastructure is not as closed as China's.  Between Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine, and March 8 the top 10 VPNs in Apple's and Google's mobile app stores in Russia saw nearly 6 million downloads, according to data compiled by SensorTower for CNBC.  Two lawmakers in the U.S. recently introduced a new bill to aid efforts to support censorship circumvention technology in Russia. The Internet Freedom and Operations Act, or INFO, introduced by Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Bob Menendez, D-N.J., would authorize funds for internet freedom programs to run through the Department of State and USAID and dedicate $50 million to internet freedom and circumvention technologies through the U.S. Agency for Global Media and affiliates.  The bill builds on the pair's earlier Open Technology Fund Authorization Act, which similarly authorized funds to support internet freedom under repressive regimes. That bill passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act last year, and its authors have credited it for helping people in Cuba get connected and organize online after the government restricted internet access.  Blackburn, in a phone interview with CNBC, said people in Cuba largely found links to VPNs and through word-of-mouth. She said there's always the potential for danger under a repressive regime in accessing restricted technology and speaking out but that she saw people in Cuba are willing to take risks ""for their shot at freedom.""  Wijermars warned that just because it's possible for people in Russia to access foreign information through VPNs doesn't mean all or even most will.  ""The smaller group that already was interested in this kind of news, that already was critical of the government, already was consuming independent news sources, they will need to use a VPN to continue consuming those news sources,"" she said. ""But it doesn't necessarily mean that the rest of the Russian population is now suddenly discovering it.""  Putin has been moving Russia toward isolation for years, and Wijermars said the current conflict has only accelerated internet trends in the region.  ""I just hope that democratic governments and international companies don't inadvertently speed that up,"" Shahbaz said.  Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

Burger King moves to divest from Russian joint venture,2022-03-18 00:19:33+00:00,"Burger King is moving to divest its 15% stake in its Russian business, but the burger chain said it can't legally suspend operations in the market right away.  The Restaurant Brands International chain announced last week it was suspending all corporate support for its 800-plus franchised locations in Russia in response to the Kremlin's ongoing attacks on Ukraine. The suspension includes refusing approvals for further investment or expansion and pausing operations, marketing and its supply chain.  But the company's International President David Shear laid out in an open letter to employees on Thursday that the structure of the company's Russian business hampers its ability to shutter restaurants in the market like some of its competitors.  ""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today? No,"" Shear said.  Burger King entered Russia through a joint venture with businessperson Alexander Kolobov, Investment Capital Ukraine and VTB Capital, which has been hit by U.S. sanctions as an affiliate of a major Russian bank.  Shear said the burger chain contacted Kolobov, who is responsible for the day-to-day operations and oversight of the Russian locations, and ""demanded the suspension of Burger King restaurant operations in Russia."" Kolobov refused, according to Shear.  Burger King owns a 15% stake in the joint venture, and none of the partners has a majority stake. According to Shear, Burger King can't immediately shut down the business on its own.  ""There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" he wrote. ""No serious investor in any industry in the world would agree to a long-term business relationship with flimsy termination clauses.""  Shear said the company has started the process of divesting its stake in the joint venture, but it will take some time to unwind based on the terms of the agreement. He also said that Burger King is in full compliance with all applicable sanctions.  Enforcing Burger King's contract would require the support of Russian authorities, which is unlikely to happen anytime soon because of the ongoing conflict and tensions with the West. "
Indian beauty company Nykaa looks to physical retail expansion,2022-03-18 07:49:38+00:00,"While Nykaa started as an e-commerce platform, founder and CEO Falguni Nayar is a ""big believer"" in physical retail and said there is demand from consumers.  ""The last two years have been very much impacted by Covid-19 and what it does to physical retail. However, we do believe that if you look at the math and statistics, e-commerce penetration is only 8%,"" Nayar said on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Thursday.  ""A lot of beauty is sold offline and Nykaa has become such a big brand that we cannot ignore our offline channel as well as offline consumers. There will be greater emphasis on stores, but I think we will continue to be a dominant e-commerce player.""  Nykaa, which sells cosmetics, grooming and fashion products, currently has 100 retail stores in India, with its latest opening just last week. The company had a blockbuster debut in November hitting a valuation of almost $14 billion – making it India's first woman-led unicorn listing.  In its most recent quarterly report, however, the company reported a 58% plunge in net profits.  The bond market is sending a recession signal. Here's when investors should take it seriously  Buy these 'safe haven' global tech stocks as risk-appetite returns, Morgan Stanley says  Morgan Stanley says these hydrogen stocks will win as countries build up their energy infrastructure  As Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’ drops, these riskier stocks should pop  Other newly public Indian companies have come under pressure as the halo of their high-profile IPOs fades and valuations come under scrutiny. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that India will probe companies hoping to IPO about valuation metrics.  While these companies largely had stellar debuts, many are now trading well below their IPO price –including Nykaa, Paytm, Zomato and CarTrade.  Nayar said tech valuations would see ""some adjustment"" due to high inflation globally and rising interest rates. For Nykaa, she said the latest round of coronavirus restrictions in major Chinese cities will likely present supply chain challenges.  ""I think that is holding us back and sometimes we have to take additional stock, assuming that disruptions will be there,"" said Nayar, who founded the company in 2012.  While Nayar said the impact of surging commodity prices and inflation remains a key watcher, she is confident in ""the lipstick effect.""  ""Cosmetics and beauty are those small luxuries that consumers don't cut down on so drastically because at the end of the day, the percentage spent on beauty in the country is as low as $12 to $14 per capita,"" she explained.  ""We do believe that the beauty industry is in an inherent structural change where Indian consumers want more beauty consumption,"" she added.

UN: Asia-Pacific is falling behind on its sustainability goals,2022-03-18 03:25:41+00:00,"Asia-Pacific isn't on track to achieving any of its sustainability targets by 2030 and the Covid pandemic has put a drag on progress in many areas, said a United Nations representative.  ""Time is running out. Right now, at the current pace, without raising ambitions, without acceleration, this region is not set to achieve any of the sustainable development goals by 2030,"" Kaveh Zahedi, deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Thursday.  Established in 2015, the UN sustainable development goals aim to make progress on a number of issues by 2030, including reducing inequality, combating climate change as well as improving health and education.  Though Zahedi said there were ""bright spots"" of decent progress on some goals like providing affordable and green energy, he said change is on the whole ""simply too slow.""  He said the region has seen a ""rollback"" in some areas and is ""going backwards"" when it comes to climate action, sustainable consumption and production.  Morgan Stanley says these hydrogen stocks will win as countries build up their energy infrastructure  Bank of America names top stock picks as Russia-Ukraine conflict hastens Europe’s energy transition  Zahedi said that regression is especially worrying given that the Asia-Pacific is particularly vulnerable climate change. He attributed the slowdown to the pandemic, which he said will set back sustainability targets by 30 or 40 years.  While the pandemic has exposed and accentuated many inequalities, Zahedi said such gaps have persisted during the recovery.  He said the rebound has been ""K-shaped"" — meaning that some countries and groups are ""doing OK,"" while others are ""not doing well at all.""  Vulnerable groups have borne the brunt of the pandemic, which he said has led to a surge in gender-based violence; people with disabilities seeing their support networks ""evaporate""; and job losses among migrants and those working in the ""informal sector"" — the part of the economy that includes gig workers, street vendors and other odd jobs.  Zahedi said children are another vulnerable demographic, with over 30 million in the region suffering from ""wasting,"" a form of malnutrition. According to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2021, the pandemic is expected to worsen all forms of malnutrition, especially in children, due to a loss of household income and disruptions to essential nutrition services, among other factors.  Children have also been pulled out of school, a situation which ""often perpetuates inequality from one generation to the next,"" he added.  Zahedi argued sustainability goals provide ""a roadmap out of the Covid pandemic,"" urging governments and businesses to step up.  Still, he acknowledged varying rates of progress in the region. For instance, while East and North East Asia are on track to achieving the goal of ""no poverty,"" other subregions are lagging behind.  In a report published Thursday, ESCAP stressed the need for regional collaboration and partnerships to address such gaps within Asia-Pacific. "
"Under pressure over Ukraine, Putin turns his ire on Russians",2022-03-18 00:10:39+00:00,"LONDON — Anyone looking for signs that embattled and isolated Russia might soften its position would not have found much hope in the increasingly belligerent words of President Vladimir Putin.  With his invasion of Ukraine floundering and his economy teetering, Putin doubled down Wednesday, turning his baleful glare on Russians who are against the invasion or who sympathize with the West.  ""The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors, and will simply spit them out like an insect in their mouth onto the pavement,"" he said, shoulders hunched and staring down the barrel of the camera.  It was the latest speech to surprise and alarm many who study Putin. He has adopted what they say is an emotional, ranting tone since he invaded Ukraine three weeks ago, a departure from the calculating persona of this former KGB officer.  ""He's clearly angry, emotional and feels the need to speak in this very aggressive tone,"" said John Lough, an associate fellow at London's Chatham House think tank.  Lough thinks the speech was clearly aimed at Russia's elites, some of whom he believes are privately dismayed about the failure of the war and the economic backlash it has inflicted at home.  According to Lough, Putin was saying to the elites: ""Don't think about having second thoughts. We're all in this together and if I go down, you go down.""  Putin touched on now-common themes, comparing the West to Nazi Germany and alleging, against all evidence, that Ukraine has been committing genocide against ethnic Russians. But he adopted even more hard-line rhetoric when turning his attention to Russians themselves, whom he has subjected to a sweeping crackdown on anti-war dissent in recent weeks.  Almost 15,000 protesters have been arrested in Russia since the war began, according to OVD-Info, a human rights group based in Moscow that tracks police detentions.  Unknown thousands more have fled the country, driven away by a deepening state repression of protest, independent journalism and social media, as well as a plummeting economy hit by international sanctions and mass boycotts.  The Kremlin explained Thursday that it was these people who were showing themselves to be ""traitors.""  ""They vanish from our lives,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Reuters. ""Some people are leaving their posts, some are leaving their active work life, some leave the country and move to other countries. That is how this cleansing happens.""  ""In such difficult times,"" he added, ""many people show their true colors.""  Putin's tone contrasted with the Russian and the Ukrainian negotiating teams, which signaled tentative progress in peace talks. Some experts saw his speech as a chilling sign.  ""Putin in an Orwellian way has divided the citizens of Russia into clean and unclean,"" Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said on Twitter.  Constanze Stelzenmüller, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, compared Putin's speech to Adolf Hitler's fictional tirade from the bunker in the 2004 film ""Downfall,"" whose subtitles have generated countless memes.  ""Strrronngg 'Der Untergang' vibes here,"" she tweeted, using the film's German title.  Putin reserved special ire for Russian oligarchs, many of whom are Kremlin-linked billionaires who made their fortunes amid the carve-up of the former Soviet Union and now spend much of it on yachts and other luxuries in the West. Some of them have recently broken cover and distanced themselves from Putin's war.  Without naming anyone specifically, Putin referred to ""national traitors"" who ""have villas in Miami or the French Riviera, who cannot make do without foie gras, oysters or gender freedom, as they call it"" — referring to his apparent disdain for liberal values.  He criticized their ""servile mentality"" of being too Western ""in their minds, and not here with our people and with Russia.""  Putin also called for ""a natural and necessary self-detoxification of society,"" which would ""strengthen our country, our solidarity and cohesion.""  Much of the rest of Putin's speech detailed the drastic economic countermeasures his government is introducing to combat sanctions and boycotts by Western governments and companies.  ""Indeed, it is difficult for us at the moment,"" he acknowledged.  Lough, who was the first NATO official posted to Moscow in the 1990s, says his contacts there are privately conveying ""surprise, shock and disbelief that Russia"" is engaged in the war.  There is now an ""acceptance that this is going to usher in a period of extreme isolation of Russia, as well as impoverishment and a return, frankly, to many of the features of the Soviet Union,"" he said.

Moderna seeks FDA authorization for 4th dose of Covid shot,2022-03-18 02:07:20+00:00,"Drugmaker Moderna asked the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday to authorize a fourth shot of its Covid-19 vaccine as a booster dose for all adults.  The request is broader than rival pharmaceutical company Pfizer's request earlier this week for the regulator to approve a booster shot for all seniors.  In a press release, the company said its request for approval for all adults was made ""to provide flexibility"" to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and medical providers to determine the ""appropriate use"" of a second booster dose of the mRNA vaccine, ""including for those at higher risk of COVID-19 due to age or comorbidities.""  U.S. officials have been laying the groundwork to deliver additional booster doses to shore up the vaccines' protection against serious disease and death from Covid-19. The White House has been sounding the alarm that it needs Congress to ""urgently"" approve more funding for the federal government to secure more doses of the Covid-19 vaccines, either for additional booster shots or variant-specific immunizations.  U.S. health officials currently recommend a primary series of two doses of the Moderna vaccine and a booster dose months later.  Read CNBC's latest global coverage of the Covid pandemic:  Moderna said its request for an additional dose was based on ""recently published data generated in the United States and Israel following the emergence of Omicron.""  On Tuesday, Pfizer and its partner BioNTech asked U.S. regulators to authorize an additional booster dose of their Covid-19 vaccine for seniors, saying data from Israel suggests older adults would benefit.

Merck's Keytruda reduced risk of disease recurrence or death in early lung cancer patients by 24%,2022-03-22 15:46:03+00:00,"Merck's antibody therapy for early stage lung cancer patients who have previously undergone surgery to have tumors removed reduced the risk of the disease progressing or the patient dying by 24%, according to clinical trial data released Thursday.  Keytruda is a monoclonal antibody treatment that helps activate the body's immune system to fight off non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease. The 200-milligram intravenous injections are administered once every three weeks for a total of 18 injections over the course of a year.  Merck's head of global clinical development, Dr. Roy Baynes, described the reduced risk of the cancer returning as significant and clinically meaningful. Baynes also expects Keytruda to improve patients' overall survival rate, though he said the data is not mature enough yet to draw a definitive conclusion in that regard.  ""When you treat a tumor early, it takes quite a long time for bad outcomes to translate into death,"" Baynes said. ""So the trial is too immature at this point to comment on overall survival, although we would say that the overall survival is directionally favorable at this time.""  The clinical trial for early stage lung cancer patients post-surgery evaluated more than 1,000 people randomized into two groups, 590 who received the treatment and 587 who received a placebo. Patients who received Keytruda were disease for more than four years at the median, about a year longer than those in the placebo group. The trial included patients who received chemotherapy and those who hadn't.  Merck plans to submit the data to the Food and Drug Administration as quickly as possible, spokesperson Melissa Moody said. The approval process can take eight to 12 months, according to Baynes. Keytruda was first approved by the FDA in 2014 to treat melanoma and has become a blockbuster drug for Merck that is now used to treat numerous other types of cancer.  Baynes said significant progress has been made in treating lung cancer with immune therapy. He noted that in the case of metastatic lung cancer, where the disease has advanced to other areas of the body, Keytruda in combination with chemo has improved the five-year survival rate to 40%. Typically, the survival rate is only 5%.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally with more than 1.7 million people succumbing to the disease in 2020, according to the World Health Organization. People diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer normally undergo surgery to remove the tumors if the disease is caught at an early stage. After surgery, patients undergo either observation or receive chemotherapy. Risk factors include a history of smoking and asbestos exposure among others.  Read CNBC's latest global coverage of the Covid pandemic:  However, half of all patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer have the disease return within five years after removing the tumors and most of them see the cancer return in two years, according to Dr. Mary O'Brien, a co-principal investigator in the trial and an oncologist at Royal Marsden Hospital in London. Patients live with the constant fear and anxiety that the cancer will return, she said.  Keytruda stops cancer cells from shutting down the body's defense system. Cancer cells have a protein that binds to a receptor on T cells, which tricks them into not going on the attack. The Keytruda monoclonal antibody binds to this receptor instead, foiling the cancer's trick and allowing the immune system to fight the disease.  Baynes said the drug is generally well tolerated, though there are side effects associated with the immune system kicking into gear. An example is thyroid toxicity, which occurs when the thyroid releases too much hormone into the body. In more serious but rare cases, patients can develop pneumonitis, an inflammation of the lung tissue, he said. Thyroid toxicity is treated with antithyroid medication and pneumonitis with steroids.  Merck's Keytruda sales totaled $17.2 billion in 2021 or about 35% of the company's $48.7 billion in total revenue for the year. CEO Rob Davis told investors on Merck's fourth-quarter earnings call that using Keytruda to prevent cancer from returning in patients is a major area of future growth for the company.  While the cancer immune therapy is a major area of clinical research, the FDA has only approved one treatment so far to prevent lung cancer from returning in patents who have undergone surgery. The agency approved Tecentriq, made by Genentech, last October.  Clarification: This story has been updated to note that Keytruda is administered through intravenous injection, and one possible side effect is thyroid toxicity.  "
Australian watchdog sues Facebook-owner Meta over scam advertisements ,2022-03-18 04:43:28+00:00,"Australia's competition watchdog filed a lawsuit against Facebook owner Meta Platforms on Friday, alleging the social media giant failed to prevent scammers using its platform to promote fake ads featuring well-known people.  The advertisements, which endorsed investment in cryptocurrency or money-making schemes, could have misled Facebook users into believing they were promoted by famous Australians, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said.  The lawsuit filed in the Federal Court also alleges Facebook ""aided and abetted or was knowingly concerned in false or misleading conduct and representations by the advertisers,"" the ACCC said in a statement.  ""The essence of our case is that Meta is responsible for these ads that it publishes on its platform,"" ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. ""It is alleged that Meta was aware ... scam ads were being displayed on Facebook but did not take sufficient steps to address the issue.""  Meta said any ads that scammed people out of money or misled users violated its policies and the company uses technology to detect and block such posts, adding it had ""cooperated with the ACCC's investigation into this matter to date.""  ""We will review the recent filing by the ACCC and intend to defend the proceedings,"" a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement, declining to comment further as the case was before court.  The ACCC said the ads used images of several Australian business leaders, TV hosts and politicians and contained links to fake media articles that included quotes attributed to the personalities.  Users who signed up were contacted by scammers to convince them to deposit funds into the fake schemes, the regulator said.  ""We are aware of a consumer who lost more than A$650,000 ($480,000) due to one of these scams ... this is disgraceful,"" Sims said.  Australian iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest, chairman of Fortescue Metals Group, launched criminal proceedings against Facebook last month over scam ads, including ones using his image to promote cryptocurrency schemes.  The corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), usually handles financial fraud complaints against companies. The ACCC, which is seeking financial penalties, said it was given temporary powers to file the lawsuit.  Facebook earlier this week announced a program to help train Australian political candidates and influencers on cyber security to stop the spread of potential misinformation during campaigning for the country's upcoming federal election.

"Bank of Japan maintains huge stimulus, warns of growth risks from Ukraine crisis",2022-03-18 04:45:51+00:00,"The Bank of Japan maintained its massive stimulus on Friday and warned of risks to a fragile economic recovery from the Ukraine crisis, reinforcing expectations it will remain an outlier amid a global shift towards tighter monetary policy.  The BOJ's dovish tone is in stark contrast with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which raised interest rates this week to stop fast-rising inflation becoming entrenched.  As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its short-term rate target at -0.1% and that for the 10-year bond yield around 0% at the two-day policy meeting that ended on Friday.  ""Japan's economy is picking up as a trend,"" the BOJ said in a statement. The view was less optimistic than that of the previous meeting in January, when it said the economy was showing ""clearer signs of pick-up.""  The central bank also warned of fresh risks from the Ukraine crisis, which it said was destabilizing financial markets and sharply pushing up raw material costs.  ""There is very high uncertainty on the impact developments in Ukraine could have on Japan's economy and prices via markets, raw material prices and overseas economies,"" the statement said.  While inflation is seen approaching or even exceeding its 2% target in coming months, the BOJ is in no mood to withdraw stimulus as it sees the recent energy-driven price rise as transitory and a possible threat to an economy only just recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.  The world's third-largest economy likely saw growth stall in the current quarter as supply disruptions and Covid-19 curbs hobbled output and consumption.  At his post-meeting briefing, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is likely to stress his resolve to sustain huge monetary support until the rise in inflation is accompanied by strong wage growth.  Earlier in the day, data showed Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.6% year-on-year in February, below the BOJ's target but marking the fastest pace in two years in a sign of growing inflationary pressure from higher energy costs.   In a sign of the pain rising fuel costs is already inflicting on households, energy and electricity bills both shooting up by around 20% in February from year-before levels, the fastest pace since 1981.

The city has experienced shelling since the start of the invasion, but attacks have mounted in recent days, including airstrikes on residential buildings.  —Jessica Bursztynsky  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a ""turning point for the world,"" arguing that victory for President Vladimir Putin's forces would herald ""a new age of intimidation.""  Speaking to a Conservative Party conference, Johnson claimed Putin was ""terrified"" that the example of a free Ukraine would spark a pro-democracy revolution in Russia.  He said ""a victorious Putin will not stop in Ukraine, and the end of freedom in Ukraine will mean the extinction of any hope of freedom in Georgia and then Moldova, it will mean the beginning of a new age of intimidation across eastern Europe from the Baltic to the Black Sea.""  — Associated Press  Russia has killed 847 Ukrainian civilians, including 64 children, since Russia began its armed attack against Ukraine on Feb. 24, the United Nations said.  At least an additional 1,399 people, including 78 children, have been injured from Feb. 24 through March 18.  The majority of casualties recorded have been caused by the use of explosive weapons with a ""wide impact area,"" the agency said. That includes shelling from heavy artillery and air strikes.  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it believes the actual number of casualties are ""considerably higher,"" since information from areas with intense fighting is delayed and some reports are being corroborated.  —Jessica Bursztynsky  Ukrainian officials said Russian Lieutenant-General Andrei Mordvichev was killed in battle. Russian officials have not confirmed his death.  Mordvichev is the fifth Russian general killed in Ukraine since the start of war on Feb. 20, which is an unprecedented rate of leadership losses in modern warfare.  About 20 Russian generals are in Ukraine as part of the war, the New York Times reported last week, citing Western officials.  — Kif Leswing  About 700 residents were evacuated from Luhansk Oblast in Eastern Ukraine through a humanitarian corridor, the Stet Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a Telegram post.  The regional governor previously announced a temporary ceasefire, or ""regime of silence,"" to allow for evacuations on Saturday.  SES Ukraine also said that the Russians had violated the agreement and prevented some evacuations by continuing to fire shells in Popasna, a city in the region.   — Kif Leswing  Editor's note: Graphic content. This post contains a photo of casualties in Ukraine.  Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed Saturday about 14,400 Russian armed forces have been killed since the start of the invasion.  Intelligence has varied widely on the number of Russian deaths. American intelligence estimates more than 7,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, The New York Times said Wednesday. Russia, meanwhile, has claimed fewer than 500 deaths, the paper reported.  The mounting deaths come as nearly all of the troops Russia amassed on the border are now fighting inside the country. President Joe Biden previously said Moscow had 190,000 troops prepared. Still, Russia has struggled with logistics, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said earlier in the day, with forces not advancing as quickly as they thought they would.  The Ukrainian government also detailed a list of weapons Russians have lost. It says Russian losses include 466 tanks, 213 artillery pieces, 3 vessels and 44 anti-aircraft warfare systems.  —Jessica Bursztynsky  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on the Swiss government to freeze the bank accounts of all Russian oligarchs.  Swiss public broadcaster SRF reported that Zelenskyy, who spoke via livestream to thousands of antiwar protesters in the Swiss city of Bern, said ""in your banks are the funds of the people who unleashed this war. Help to fight this. So that their funds are frozen. (...) It would be good to take away those privileges from them.""  SRF also reported that the Ukrainian president criticized the Swiss multinational food conglomerate Nestle, which has decided not to withdraw from Russia for the time being, as opposed to many other international companies.  — Associated Press  U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russia hasn't progressed as quickly as they would have liked to.  ""They've struggled with logistics,"" Austin said in an interview with CNN.  ""We've seen a number of missteps along the way.""  Austin said the Pentagon hasn't seen any evidence that the Kremlin is making good use of intelligence reports or integrating air combat with its ground assaults.   ""So there are a number of things that we would expect to have seen that we just haven't seen ... Many of their assumptions have not proven to be true as they entered this fight,"" he said.  He added that Russia has not yet been able to achieve their goal of seizing Ukraine's capital of Kyiv.  — Annie Nova  There are 562 Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine as of Saturday, according to Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk and the General Staff of Ukraine's Army.  President Joe Biden had previously said Moscow had 190,000 troops prepared for war. Earlier in the day, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russia's troops have struggled with logistics.  — Annie Nova  Russian cosmonauts arrive wearing yellow and blue flight suits, colors that match Ukraine's flag, at the International Space Station after docking their Soyuz capsule on Friday.   The men were the first new arrivals on the space station since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine last month.  It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send.  Oleg Artemyev was asked about the yellow flight suits when the newly arrived cosmonauts were able to talk to family back on Earth. He said every crew chooses its own flight suits, so that they are not all the same.  ""It became our turn to pick a color. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that's why we had to wear yellow,"" he said.  — Associated Press  Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said at a press conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that Putin has put all of Europe at risk with its invasion of Ukraine.  ""Unfortunately, there is now not a single country that can live with the illusion that they're safe and secure,"" Petkov said.  A senior U.S. defense official on Friday said the Russians have launched more than 1,080 missiles since the start of the war and that they retain about 90% of the combat power they had arrayed around Ukraine at the beginning of the invasion  — Annie Nova  More than 1.5 million children have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded the country on Feb. 24, according to UNICEF.  The agency warned that many of Ukraine's displaced women and children could be at increased risk of human trafficking and exploitation.  ""The war in Ukraine is leading to massive displacement and refugee flows – conditions that could lead to a significant spike in human trafficking and an acute child protection crisis,"" said Afshan Khan, UNICEF's regional director for Europe and Central Asia.  — Annie Nova  Ukrainian media reported that Russian forces carried out a large-scale air strike on Mykolaiv, killing at least 40 Ukrainian soldiers at their brigade headquarters.  Ukrainian authorities said they have not seen any significant shifts over the past 24 hours in front line areas, noting cities of Mariupol, Mykolaiv and Kherson in the south, and Izyum in the east continued to see the heaviest fighting.  EDITORS NOTE: Graphic content. The following photos contain images of casualties at Mykolaiv.  — Getty Images  Russia said it has used hypersonic Kinzhal, or Dagger, missiles to destroy a weapons depot in Ukraine's western Ivano-Frankivsk region, Reuters reports.  It was the first time Russia had deployed its hypersonic Kinzhal system since the start of the war, Russia's Interfax news agency said.  Defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told a briefing that the underground depot hit by the Kinzhal system on Friday housed Ukrainian missiles and aircraft ammunition. Reuters said it was not able to independently verify Konashenkov's comments.  — Terri Cullen  Ukrainian authorities have not observed any comprehensive shifts in front-line areas over the past 24 hours, according to an advisor to Ukraine's presidential office.  Reuters reports that Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video address that fighting was ongoing. They cited the cities of Mariupol, Mykolaiv and Kherson as among the hotspots where Russian troops were on the offensive.  — Sam Meredith  Ukraine's military has ordered a 38-hour curfew in the southern city of Zaporizhzhya, starting at 2 p.m. London time and ending early on Monday.  ""Do not go outside at this time!"" Deputy mayor Anatoliy Kurtiev said, according to Reuters.  — Sam Meredith  Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said the country hopes to evacuate citizens via 10 humanitarian corridors from cities and towns on the front line of Russia's invasion.   A corridor had been agreed for the besieged city of Mariupol, Vereshchuk said, according to Reuters. Previous attempts to secure safe passage for civilians under a temporary ceasefire have mostly failed, with Russia and Ukraine blaming one another.    It has been reported roughly 350,000 people are sheltering in the southeastern city of Mariupol, with no access to food or water.   — Sam Meredith  The United Nations has reported 2,149 civilian casualties in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion over three weeks ago, with 816 killed and 1,333 injured.  The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights believes the actual figures are likely considerably higher, particularly given intense hostilities in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions in recent days.  Most of the civilian casualties recorded so far were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, the U.N. said, including shelling and missile and air strikes.  — Sam Meredith  Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said four American soldiers have died in a plane crash while participating in a NATO military exercise called Cold Response.  ""It is with great sadness we have [received] the message that four American soldiers died in a plane crash last night,"" Store said via Twitter on Saturday morning.  ""The soldiers participated in the NATO exercise Cold Response. Our deepest sympathies go to the soldiers' families, relatives and fellow soldiers in their unit.""  Local police were said to be investigating the cause of the crash, Reuters reported, although bad weather had stalled their work.  — Sam Meredith  The U.K. Defense Ministry has warned Russia will likely resort to the ""indiscriminate use of firepower"" after failing to achieve its original objectives so far.  ""Russia has been forced to change its operational approach and is now pursuing a strategy of attrition,"" the U.K. Defense Ministry said in a Twitter post.  As a result of the change in tactics, Ukraine's humanitarian crisis could worsen as civilian casualties climb and more infrastructure is destroyed, it warned.  The Defense Ministry reiterated that Moscow ""has been surprised by the scale and ferocity of Ukrainian Resistance.""  — Joanna Tan  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Russia to come to the table for talks.   ""Meaningful peace and security talks for Ukraine are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,"" he said a video address on Saturday.  ""It's time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Otherwise, Russia's losses will be such that you will not have several generations to rise.""  — Joanna Tan  Biden held a nearly two-hour phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Both Biden and Xi agreed on the need to promote peace and assist with the humanitarian disaster created by the invasion. But they disagreed deeply on who is responsible for the suffering in Ukraine, with the Chinese leader refusing to hold Russia singularly accountable for the unprovoked invasion.  Instead, official readouts from Beijing made it clear that Xi's position was that the U.S. and Europe had provoked Russian President Vladimir Putin into attacking Ukraine by expanding NATO into Eastern Europe.  During the call, Biden ""described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia,"" the White House said.  — Christina Wilkie  China says Xi told Biden 'peace and security' are needed in Ukraine; missile strikes near Lviv "
Biden warns Xi of global backlash if China helps Russia's attack on Ukraine,2022-03-19 01:43:16+00:00,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden held a nearly two-hour phone call on Friday morning with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The call was seen as a critical test of whether Biden could convince China to stay on the sidelines of the conflict in Ukraine, and to turn down Russian requests for military or economic aid.  Both Biden and Xi agreed on the need to promote peace and assist with the humanitarian disaster created by the invasion. But they disagreed deeply on who is responsible for the suffering in Ukraine, with the Chinese leader refusing to hold Russia singularly accountable for the unprovoked invasion.  Instead, official readouts from Beijing made it clear that Xi's position was that the U.S. and Europe had provoked Russian President Vladimir Putin into attacking Ukraine by expanding NATO into Eastern Europe.  During the call, Biden ""described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia,"" the White House said.  Pentagon officials said last week that Moscow has asked Beijing for military and economic assistance to wage its war against Ukraine, and that initial intelligence reports suggested China had agreed.  Following the call Friday, neither Chinese nor American officials would say whether Biden had shifted Xi's thinking on Russia in any way.  The White House stressed that Biden's goal had never been to secure assurances directly from Xi that China would not help Russia, merely to clarify the choices facing Beijing.  ""The President really laid out in a lot of detail the unified response, not only from governments around the world but also the private sector, to Russia's brutal aggression in Ukraine,"" a senior administration official told reporters on Friday afternoon.  Biden ""made clear that there would likely be consequences for those who would step in to support Russia at this time,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  According to a readout of the call from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xi told Biden that the United States and China each had an obligation to promote peace in Ukraine.  ""The Ukraine crisis is not something we want to see,"" Xi reportedly said to Biden.  But even as he decried the human cost in Ukraine of Russia's invasion, Xi still refused to directly blame Putin or the Kremlin for what is happening there.  Instead, Xi suggested Europe and the United States forced Putin's hand — echoing one of Moscow's favorite talking points.  ""He who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off,"" Xi said to Biden, according to a longer readout of the call released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The Chinese idiom is one that Xi has used before, and it means that whoever created the problem must solve it. In Xi's view, Putin is the tiger and NATO tied the bell.  For now, however, China said Xi told Biden its pressing priorities are ""to keep the dialogue and negotiation going, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, and cease hostilities as soon as possible.""  To that end, Beijing is ""ready to provide further humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other affected countries,"" the state readout said.  The Chinese government said Xi also referenced a ""six-point initiative on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine,"" but the foreign ministry did not provide details on what that would entail.  Still, the mere fact that China will provide humanitarian assistance to Ukraine is a sign that, at least on the surface, Xi's ironclad alliance with his ally Putin may be under strain.  Spokesmen for both the Russian and Chinese governments publicly deny that Russia has reached out to China for help waging its war against Ukraine.  But the unprecedented economic sanctions imposed on Russia by NATO members and G-7 countries in response to the invasion have left the Kremlin isolated and, some analysts say, desperate for financial assistance and military supplies.  Defense officials said China appeared to be open to supplying Russia with military supplies, but there are few indications so far that China will overtly help Moscow evade economic sanctions.  Beijing has little interest in becoming embroiled in the economic battle between Russia and the rest of the developed world.  ""China is not a party to the crisis, nor does it want the sanctions to affect China,"" Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a phone call Monday with Spain's foreign minister, Jose Manuel Albares.   The call between Biden and Xi began just after 9 a.m. Eastern and lasted just shy of two hours. That's an unusually long time for a presidential call with the leader of a U.S. adversary.  Xi and Biden ""share the view that China and the US need to respect each other, coexist in peace and avoid confrontation, and that the two sides should increase communication and dialogue at all levels and in all fields,"" the Chinese readout said.

"Russia backs down on demands in Iran nuclear deal talks, making revival of 2015 pact imminent",2022-03-22 15:53:04+00:00,"Russia has walked back its threat to torpedo the revival of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal over recent sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine, reopening the way to an agreement after nearly a year of talks.   The parties involved in the pact, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, were reportedly close to reaching a deal in Vienna until the U.S. and EU imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Moscow then demanded that future trade with Iran not be impacted by Western sanctions, prompting the talks to be suspended last week.   Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday that he had ""received written guarantees"" from the U.S. that its demands would be met, meaning the talks will likely proceed. The nearly simultaneous release of British-Iranian dual nationals from years of Iranian detention back to the U.K. and a reported U.K. repayment of a decades-old $530 million debt to Iran have improved prospects for an agreement.        ""Deal could come together quite quickly — potentially as soon as this week,"" analysts at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group wrote in a note Wednesday.   ""Russia's decision to moderate its demands clears the most significant hurdle in front of the JCPOA's revival,"" the analysts wrote, putting the odds of a deal passing at an optimistic 80%. ""The release of the two British-Iranian prisoners is another positive signal that talks are nearing a conclusion,"" they said.  With the U.S. terminating its imports of Russian oil and the EU looking to reduce its energy dependency on Moscow, Iranian crude is looking more alluring — as is the crude from other heavily sanctioned countries like Venezuela, which has reportedly been in energy discussions with U.S. officials.  A return to the 2015 deal, which originally lifted sanctions on Iran in return for limits on its nuclear program, would see the return of Iranian oil to the market at a time when energy supply shortages and geopolitical volatility have brought crude prices to their highest in more than a decade.   This would ""boost global oil supplies and could put downwards pressure on prices,"" James Swanston, Middle East and North Africa economist at London-based firm Capital Economics, wrote in a note Thursday, adding that ""it may also help to ease geopolitical tensions in the region."" Still, a return to previous production levels will take time.   Commodities analysts at S&P Global predict that if sanctions were to be lifted on Iran immediately, it could export an additional 500,000 barrels of oil per day to markets from April to May of this year, with that figure reaching an additional 1.3 million barrels per day by the end of this year.  Iran was the fifth-largest producer in OPEC in 2020. Before the Donald Trump administration unilaterally ditched the deal in 2018 and re-imposed crippling sanctions on Iran's economy, the country was producing 3.8 million barrels of oil per day. This later dropped to as low as 1.9 million barrels and is currently about 2.4 million barrels per day, according to the Atlantic Council — though most of this has had to remain in storage rather than be exported due to the sanctions.  Since the U.S. withdrawal from the deal, Tehran has made significant progress in terms of its nuclear activity, increasing uranium enrichment and stockpiles far beyond the parameters of the 2015 agreement.   This means it has shrunk its ""breakout time,"" or the amount of time it would take to be able to build a nuclear bomb. Iran's leaders said its advances would continue as long as U.S. sanctions aren't lifted.   Eleven months after negotiations restarted, with the U.S and Iran not speaking directly but through European mediators, the remaining sticking points relate mostly to sanctions-related issues, including whether Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps will continue to be designated by the U.S. as a Foreign Terrorist Organization list.   ""But these are unlikely to prove insurmountable,"" Eurasia's analysts say, considering that both Washington and Tehran want a deal.   The prospect of a return to the deal has not sat well with Washington's Arab Gulf allies, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two of OPEC's leading crude producers and longtime adversaries of Iran. The two reportedly did not take President Joe Biden's calls as he attempted to convince them to increase their oil production to alleviate soaring prices.  OPEC has not indicated any move to upping its production beyond pre-planned increases agreed between OPEC members and their non-OPEC allies, led by Russia, in 2021.

Four Americans die as military aircraft crashes in Norway,2022-03-19 08:32:53+00:00,"All four people on board a U.S. military aircraft were killed when it crashed in a remote part of northern Norway on Friday during a NATO-led military training exercise, local police said on Saturday.  ""As far as the police are aware, all four are of American nationality,"" police said. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere tweeted condolences over what he said was the death of four Americans.  The MV-22B Osprey aircraft belonging to the U.S. Marine Corps was taking part in an exercise called Cold Response.  Rescue services reached the crash site by land early on Saturday after helicopters were unable to land due to poor weather conditions. Gale-force winds were blowing, heavy rains were falling, and there was a risk of avalanches, according to local weather forecasts.  ""Police reached the crash site at around 0130 CET (0030 GMT). It is regrettably confirmed that all four on board the plane have perished,"" Ivar Bo Nilsson, head of the operation for Nordland police, said in a statement.  Police were investigating the cause of the crash although their work was halted because of the weather conditions. The work was set to resume once the weather improves.  Some 30,000 troops from 27 countries are involved in Cold Response, an exercise designed to prepare NATO member countries for the defence of Norway.  "
Goldman gives 5 possible reasons behind the market's mysterious comeback this week,2022-03-18 20:08:54+00:00,
"East Timor, Asia's youngest nation, votes for president",2022-03-19 03:46:40+00:00,"Polls opened in East Timor on Saturday, as Asia's youngest nation held its fifth presidential elections since independence, with concerns over political stability and economic security at the forefront.  The 16 presidential hopefuls include former resistance fighter and incumbent President Francisco ""Lu Olo"" Guterres as well as independence figure and Nobel laureate Jose Ramos-Horta and a former Catholic priest.  At polling booths in the capital Dili, Timorese donned masks and queued patiently as they waited to vote.  ""We must choose a new generation so that we can build this country,"" said one voter, Jorge Mendonca Soares, 42, of his desire for change.  While the nation's independence figures still dominate the field, for the first time there are also four female candidates, including deputy prime minister Armanda Berta Dos Santos.  A recent poll by the national university showed that Ramos-Horta, 72, former defense forces commander Lere Anan Timur and Guterres are the favorites.  Polls close at 3 p.m. with early indicators of who is leading the vote expected to come late Saturday.  If no candidate wins an outright majority, the vote will proceed to a run-off on April 19 between the top two contenders.  Approaching 20 years since independence after the end of a brutal occupation by Indonesia, East Timor has for long spells struggled with political instability.  After the last elections in 2018, Guterres refused to swear in some ministers from the National Congress of the Reconstruction of East Timor (CNRT), a political party led by former prime minister Xanana Gusmao.  The move led to an ongoing political stalemate.   Ramos-Horta, who is backed by Xanana's CNRT party, said earlier this week he was running because he felt the current president had ""exceeded his powers.""  In East Timor's political system, the president appoints a government and has the power to veto ministers or dissolve parliament.  During a recent election debate, Guterres pledged to ensure peace and stability, defend East Timor's sovereignty and follow peace and stability, defend East Timor's sovereignty and follow the constitution if he won a new term.  Heavily dependent on dwindling supplies of oil and gas, economic diversification and the role of young voters have also been key election issues, with an estimated 20% of voters reaching the voting age of 17 and casting their ballot for the first time.  First-time voter Marco de Jesus, 17, said he felt nervous but relaxed after help from polling staff.  ""I feel proud to have carried out my function as a voter,"" he said, speaking outside a polling station on Dili's waterfront.  ""I hope my choice can bring positive and useful change."" "
Mark Zuckerberg's young people advice: Focus on building relationships,2022-03-18 17:50:47+00:00,"Most people know Facebook's dorm-room origin story. But according to Mark Zuckerberg, you might have learned the wrong lesson from it.  On a recent episode of the ""Lex Fridman Podcast,"" hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said his initial ability to launch Facebook back in 2004 wasn't because he dropped out of college or abandoned any of his other interests. Rather, the Meta CEO said, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.  Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is ""the most important decision"" any student can make on campus. ""You become the people you surround yourself with,"" he explained. ""I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they're basically building relationships [with].""  Zuckerberg met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University in the early 2000s. Their business went on to revolutionize social media and become one of the world's largest companies: Meta has a market capitalization of $582.58 billion, as of Friday afternoon.  The group ultimately split up in an infamously messy fashion, roughly detailed in the 2010 film ""The Social Network."" But Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he still tries to prioritize relationships over objectives today. That applies especially to hiring, he said: When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person, instead of being their boss.  ""I will only hire someone to work for me if I could see myself working for them,"" he said.  Zuckerberg said the strategy creates a work environment that's both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you'll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It's all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike ""choosing friends or a partner.""  The prioritization of relationships over objectives could also help explain a few of Zuckerberg's more controversial decisions at Meta's helm. For example, in a leaked 2016 memo first surfaced by Hacker News, Zuckerberg defended then-board member Peter Thiel, a major benefactor of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.  Zuckerberg wrote that keeping Thiel on the board was more important than any perceived blowback the company might receive, arguing that Facebook ""can't create a culture that says it cares about diversity and then excludes almost half the country because they back a political candidate.""  The move may have had consequences. Many of Zuckerberg's critics believe his allegiance to Thiel, an early Facebook investor, may have affected how Facebook monitored ⁠— or ignored ⁠— misinformation on the social media platform leading up to the 2016 and 2020 elections.  In 2019, a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that Thiel was among those who pressured Zuckerberg to not fact-check political ads on his platform. That year, three longtime board members left the company. Both Democrat and Republican lawmakers have since criticized how Facebook manages content on its platform.

Finland named the world’s happiest for the fifth year in a row,2022-03-18 20:02:21+00:00,"Finland has been named the world's happiest country for the fifth year in a row, according to an annual report, with fellow Nordic countries also continuing to rank highly.     The United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network's 10th World Happiness Report, published Friday, found that Finland's score was ""significantly ahead"" of other countries in the top 10.  Denmark remained in second place, followed by Iceland, while Sweden and Norway occupied the seventh and eighth spots on the list, respectively.  The rankings are based on how the 146 countries on the list scored in the Gallup World Poll between 2019 and 2021. The scoring covers factors such as gross domestic product per capita and social support, as well as how a country's citizens gauge their freedom to make life choices and generosity.  In fact, the report noted a global upsurge in benevolence in 2021, amid the Covid-19 pandemic.  John Helliwell, a professor at the University of British Columbia who helped edit the report, said there had been a ""remarkable worldwide growth"" in the three acts of kindness measured by the Gallup World Poll: helping strangers, volunteering and donations. People were doing all three nearly 25% more than before the pandemic, he pointed out.  Indeed, although this data was collected prior to Russia's attack on Ukraine, the crisis has seen many people from neighboring countries eager to help Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war.  The report also highlighted that Nordic countries tended to demonstrate higher levels of personal and institutional trust, and were generally better at handling the coronavirus pandemic. For instance, there were 27 deaths per 100,000 people from Covid-19 in Nordic countries in 2020 and 2021, compared to 80 in the rest of Western Europe.  However, the report also noted the divide between Sweden, which chose not to impose full social-distancing restrictions at the onset of the pandemic, and the rest of the Nordic countries. Covid death rates were five times higher in Sweden, at 75 per 100,000, than in the rest of the Nordic countries, at 15 per 100,000.  This edition of the World Happiness Report also attempted to use the data to shed light on the ""often-overlooked and under-appreciated"" factor of balance and harmony. Once again, people in Nordic countries, in particular, were found to experience higher levels of balance and harmony.  Check out: Children in the Netherlands are among the world’s happiest.

Jim Chanos reveals new short position in crypto exchange Coinbase,2022-03-18 22:21:58+00:00,
Investors come off a strong week looking for more gains now that they have some clarity from the Fed,2022-03-18 22:25:19+00:00,"With the Federal Reserve's first rate hike out of the way, market pros are now debating whether the market can continue the upswing it started in the past week.  A powerful rally in technology and growth stocks helped drive the stock market higher in its best week of the year. The S&P 500 was up about 6.2% for the week, ending at 4,463. The Nasdaq was up 8.2%, and the Dow gained 5.5%.  Consumer discretionary stocks gained more than 9% as the top performing sector, followed by technology, up about 7.8%. Energy was the only major sector to decline, falling 3.6%.  Some of the names that had been most punished like airlines, were among the biggest winners on the week. Airlines were up about 14.7% for the week. High growth names also bounced, with the ARK Innovation Fund, a poster child for growth, jumping about 17.4%. The fund is still down more than 46% over the last six months.  Ukraine will continue to be a focus, and headlines could continue to create volatility in the coming week. Investors are also watching the course of Covid, which is causing shutdowns of Chinese cities and is spreading again at a higher rate in Europe.  There are more than a dozen Fed speeches, including from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who appears at an economics conference Monday and at an international banking conference Wednesday. The economic calendar is relatively light, with durable goods and both services and manufacturing PMI released Thursday.  ""The anticipation of the first rate hike did more damage than the rate hike itself. We got ourselves twisted in a knot, starting in December, with the Fed pivot from transitory inflation to tapering"" [bond purchases], said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""That's kind of behind us now as a headwind. That diminishes the impact that any parade of Fed speakers will deliver.""  The market indeed ignored hawkish comments Friday from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who appeared on CNBC. Both said they want to raise rates faster than the median seven hikes the Fed expects this year.  The Fed released its interest rate forecast Wednesday, when it raised its fed funds target rate range by a quarter point to 0.25% to 0.50%, its first rate hike since 2018. The Fed also said it would look to start reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet at an upcoming meeting.  Tech and growth did well in the past week, and they are the stock groups most hurt by higher interest rates. They typically command higher prices because investors buy them for their future earnings, and easy money makes them very attractive.  Strategists say tech can continue to gain in a rising rate environment, now that some of the excesses are wrung out of the group. But they may not be the leaders they once were.  ""I think the stage has been set by the Fed for investors to focus on earnings again,"" said Julian Emanuel, head of equities, derivatives and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI. ""Bottom line...earnings estimates since the beginning of the year have risen.""  Emanuel said he expects the market could continue to rise in the near term, barring an escalation of geopolitical events. While it appears oil prices may have peaked, he said it is still not clear whether stocks put in the low for the year.  ""Sentiment is absolutely horrendous...You put it all together, and we just think it's a recipe for higher share prices looking out over the next month or two,"" Emanuel said. He said investors are now able to discount the fact the Fed has begun its rate hiking cycle.  ""We're there. We know what's going to happen. We know they're going to do 0.25% in May. We know they're going to start QT [quantitative tightening] some time at mid-year,"" he said. ""They're not raising rates enough that it's really going to hurt the market and investors can focus on earnings again."" He expects S&P 500 profits to be up 9.3% this year.  Hogan said the market is leaning towards a favorable outcome for Ukraine, such as a cease fire, although no developments suggest an end is now in sight.  ""Everyone is leaning in this direction that this will come to an end in weeks rather than months,"" he said. ""If not, the market is going to have to recalibrate that.""  Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, focuses on the short-term technicals of the market, and he said after a strong run, the market could digest some of its gains early in the week.  ""After an impressive week like this, most active traders are reducing risk into this [S&P 500] 4,400 level, not adding to it,"" said Redler. ""If we could digest a day or two after quadruple witching that might give us some signals that this could continue towards 4,600."" The quadruple expiration of options and futures was Friday.  Redler said Russia's war in Ukraine and Fed policy tightening will continue to hang over the market, and that might keep the S&P 500 in a range. ""I don't think anyone is thinking the market goes right back to all-time highs anytime soon,"" he said. ""I think we're smack in the middle of a range. This is a very neutral spot not to get short and not to add to longs. We'll see how we digest this next week. For me, I think oil put the high in for the year, and that could be helpful.""  Oil briefly popped to $130.50 per barrel earlier this month, when investors feared sanctions on Russia would restrict its oil exports and create major shortages. Since then oil has fallen back, and West Texas Intermediate crude futures were trading just under $105 per barrel Friday.  Redler said an important test for the S&P 500 will be to see if it can hold the top third of its range and stay above 4,330. ""It if can hold that, the next move could be higher,"" he said. ""That would show commitment to this week's actions.""  Technology shares made a strong comeback, and Redler said he is watching to see if they continue to lead. ""Tesla helped lead the way all week. A bunch of tech names did break their downtrends,"" he said. ""Tesla, NVIDIA and Amazon have been buyable on dips...NVIDIA gave clues that the bounce was as believable as it because it was one of the first stocks to cross its downtrend line.""  Apple and Microsoft, both higher on the week, could be important drivers of the market in the coming week.  ""Apple and Microsoft haven't been a headwind but they weren't a tailwind. If they could outperform a little bit, they could help the broader indices,"" Redler said. He said the two stocks, the biggest by market cap, were higher on the week, but they lagged the Nasdaq's gains because they had they had large sell imbalances during the quadruple witching expiration.  ""The stocks with the biggest buybacks have the biggest selling imbalances,"" Redler said.

"Burger King, Subway, M&S: Western brands in Russian franchise deals",2022-03-18 22:15:26+00:00,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelelnskyy in his address to U.S. Congress Wednesday reiterated calls for all global brands to exit Russia — a market ""flooded with [Ukrainian] blood"" — as part of ongoing efforts to apply economic pressure to the pariah state.  More than 400 companies have announced their withdrawal from Russia since the launch of its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to a list compiled by Yale School of Management.  For some brands, however, a clean break is easier said than done.  Fast food giants Burger King and Subway, British retailer Marks & Spencer and hotel chains Accor and Marriott are among a number of companies restricted from withdrawing amid complicated franchise agreements.  ""Unlike a company-owned operation, a franchise company going into an international market makes a binding, long-term contractual commitment to a sophisticated counter-party, typically a franchisee or licensee,"" Dean Fournaris, partner in Wiggin and Dana's franchise and distribution practice, told CNBC.  Under such contracts, a company — known as a franchisor — outsources its brand to a counter-party — known as a franchisee — which then owns and operates the brand in a specific location. Companies looking to expand their footprint in a particular market can find such agreements make sense from an operational or financial perspective. But, as legally binding contracts, once signed, they can leave little room for maneuver.  That has complicated some Western brands' efforts to step back from Russia — even as many peers have paused operations or exited the market entirely over their rejection of Moscow's invasion and logistical challenges that have arisen as a result.  ""Brands with only company-owned operations are better positioned to shut down locations quickly because they do not have to deal with the layer of the franchise relationship,"" Earsa Jackson, a member of Clark Hill's franchise and licensing team, said.  Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International, announced last week it had halted corporate support for its 800-plus franchised restaurants in Russia and that it would refuse approvals for any expansion. However, the outlets remain in operation under a local master franchisee.  Subway, similarly, has no corporate outlets in Russia but its approximately 450 independently-owned franchised restaurants continue to operate in the country. That as competitors like McDonald's, which owns the majority of its restaurants in Russia, said it would temporarily close 850 of its restaurants in the country, at an estimated loss of $50 million per month.  ""We don't directly control these independent franchisees and their restaurants, and have limited insight into their day-to-day operations,"" Subway said in a statement.  Retailer Marks & Spencer, meanwhile, which has 48 stores in Russia, told CNBC it has ceased supplying products to its franchisor, Turkish company FiBA, but the two remain ""in discussions"" about the brand's continued operations there.  Hotel chains Accor and Marriott have also both suspended the opening of new locations in Russia but their existing locations remain in operation by third parties.  While all of those companies have expressed dismay at the war and made various commitments to redirect Russian profits or make separate donations to Ukrainian refugees, their continued presence on the Russian high street remains largely at the discretion of their franchisors.  ""Some franchisees do not want to stop operation because they claim that the Russian people are not the problem and the brand should continue to serve its customers,"" Craig Tractenberg, a partner at the law firm Fox Rothschild, said.  And with most franchisors having made significant investments in, and continued commitment to, their local outlets, any move on their side to cease operations seems unlikely.  ""If the franchisee remains ready and willing to perform, a franchisor's unilateral decision to close a location may result in litigation due to the franchisee's lost business opportunity,"" Clark Hill's Jackson said.  That leaves many Western brands in a predicament as to how to manage their legal duties while safeguarding their brands in a global landscape that is overwhelmingly opposed to Russia's war.  ""Franchise companies and their brands are in a really tough spot when it comes to Russia. On the one hand, there is a rising public and governmental sentiment in the West that all non-essential business with and within Russia should cease pending some future undetermined event, like a cease-fire or Russian withdrawal from Ukraine,"" Fournaris said.  ""At the same time, a market withdrawal from Russia would be viewed quite differently by the Russian government and more importantly its people,"" he added.  A ratcheting up of Western sanctions and further disruptions to supply chains could offer franchisors some hope of a contractual get-out as franchised brands may no longer have the means to operate.  ""Some agreements contain excuse of performance language which could benefit franchise brands. For example, if supply chain issues make it impossible to perform, franchisors may argue that performance is excused,"" Jackson said.  But more likely, companies will be left weighing the legal and financial implications of terminating their contract with the wider longevity of their brand.  ""This business decision may overlap with a moral decision. Ultimately, the question is which decision best protects the brand,"" Tractenberg said.  Meantime, the fallout could mark a new era for franchise agreements, with participants perhaps more likely in the future to make provisions for conflict risks such as ""civil unrest, insurrection and related events.""  ""The trademark provisions could be argued to support closure where the brand would be blemished by continued operation or aiding and abetting criminal activity,"" Tractenberg added. "
U.S. officials continue to press Russia for access to WNBA star Brittney Griner,2022-03-18 19:47:46+00:00,"WASHINGTON — The State Department is still working to get access to WNBA star Brittney Griner after Russian officials arrested her on accusations of smuggling drugs into the country a month ago.  Griner's arrest came days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, triggering international backlash and a slew of punishing sanctions. The 31-year-old professional athlete has been accused of smuggling hashish oil, a charge that carries up to 10 years in prison.  Jalina Porter, principal deputy spokeswoman for the State Department, told reporters on a call Friday that U.S. officials are ""closely engaged"" on Griner's case and are calling for ""fair and transparent treatment"" of American citizens detained in Russia. Porter declined to provide further details when pressed by reporters.  State Department spokesman Ned Price told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Thursday that the Biden administration is ""deeply concerned"" about Griner's case.  ""We have repeatedly asked for consular access to these detainees and have consistently been denied access. Russia must abide by its legal obligations and allow us to provide consular services for U.S. citizens detained in Russia,"" Price said.  ""We're going to continue to press for that, to continue to see to it that Russia lives up to its international obligations. All the while, we're going to do everything we can to see to it that her rights are respected,"" Price added.  On Thursday, a person close to the ongoing situation confirmed to NBC News that Griner was ""OK"" and that her Russian legal team has met her multiple times a week during the course of her detention.  The person clarified that once a pretrial investigation on Griner has concluded a trial date would be set.  If the investigation is not finished by May 19, there will be another hearing to determine an extension. Griner's request to be transferred to house arrest has been denied. "
"European markets close higher, notch best weekly gain since 2020 amid Russia-Ukraine talks",2022-03-18 16:39:47+00:00,"LONDON — European markets closed higher on Friday, notching their best weekly gain since 2020, as investors tracked negotiations between Russia and Ukraine and digested a big week of central bank decisions.  The pan-European Stoxx 600 provisionally ended 0.7% higher, with most sectors in positive territory and major bourses pointing in opposite directions. The index closed the week up more than 5.2%, registering its best weekly performance since the week through to Nov. 6, 2020.  Travel and leisure stocks led the gains on Friday, up over 2.4%, while autos slipped around 1%.   Little progress has been made so far in talks between Russian and Ukrainian diplomats after a fourth day of dialogue, as Russian forces continue to bombard Ukrainian cities. Commodity prices rallied once again as fears of tighter sanctions and persistent supply problems re-emerged.  U.S. President Joe Biden is set to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, with the two leaders to discuss topics such as Russia's war against Ukraine and competition between the two countries, according to the White House.  Shares in Asia-Pacific were mixed on Friday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index continuing to exhibit wild volatility amid a rollercoaster week.  The Bank of Japan on Friday held its monetary policy steady in a largely expected decision, warning of ""extremely high uncertainties"" in light of the situation in Ukraine and its impact on prices.  The decision came after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved its first interest rate hike in more than three years and the Bank of England on Thursday hiked rates for the third consecutive meeting.  Stateside, U.S. stocks were mixed on Friday after a three-day rally for the S&P 500 set the equity benchmark on course of its largest weekly gain since November 2020.  Earnings before the bell on Friday came from Porsche and JD Wetherspoon.   Meanwhile, the Russian central bank held its monetary policy steady and maintained its key interest rate at 20%. The bank warned of considerable uncertainty, however, as Russia's economy undergoes a ""large-scale structural transformation"" amid a barrage of international sanctions.  In terms of individual share price movement, Swiss logistics company Interroll and biotech Bachem Holding both fell more than 9% to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after their full-year earnings reports.  Toward the top of the European blue chip index, German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall gained 4.7% after UBS, Deutsche Bank and HSBC all raised their target prices for the company's shares. British IT company Softcat climbed 6% after Berenberg upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold.""  — CNBC's Sam Meredith & Eustance Huang contributed to this report.

Here's how retail investors are hedging against the market volatility,2022-03-18 17:33:35+00:00,"The market volatility is leaving the pros and retail traders in a rut.  According to a recent American Association of Individual Investors investor sentiment survey, nearly 46% of retail investors are feeling bearish about the market. It's an increase of 16% from the average weekly numbers.  Investors are worried about rising interest rates, volatility and the Ukraine war, the group's vice president, Charles Rotblut, told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week.  To hedge the risk, investors are leaning heavily on individual stocks and exchange-traded funds. Ninety-one percent of the group surveyed is holding stocks in their portfolio and 75% is invested in ETFs.  Investors typically use ETFs to invest more broadly in the market, but Rotblut is seeing investors take a more active approach with their holdings.  ""They're mixing the trading strategies where part of the portfolio is probably more traditional, conservative allocation, but they're using the stock perhaps to be more aggressive or supplemental,"" he said in a Monday interview.  ""They're tilting towards value and incorporating trading strategies, perhaps covered call options,"" Rotblut said.  During the coronavirus pandemic, the market plunged amid uncertainty but quickly recovered from its losses. Investors at the time poured into individual stocks. Now these same investors, having just seen a bull market, are looking to take some profit.  In the same interview, Andrew McOrmond, managing director at WallachBeth Capital, said the strategy works for traders looking to avoid overexposure to a single stock.  ""They are going 'it's time to take single stock risk off the table and have some ETF allocations,'"" McOrmond said. ""That's where the growth comes from.""  Disclaimer "
UK Covid cases are back on the rise as travel restrictions dropped,2022-03-18 15:38:25+00:00,"LONDON — Cases of Covid-19 are rising once again in the U.K., according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, just as the government lifts its remaining travel restrictions.  ONS figures published Friday showed that close to 1 in 21 people, the equivalent of 3.28 million, in the U.K. were estimated to have tested positive for the coronavirus in the week to March 12.  In England alone, 4.87%, equal to around 2.1 million or 1 in 20 people, were thought to have been infected with Covid-19 last week. That was up from an estimated 3.8% of England's population in the week to March 5.  Hospitalizations linked to the virus were also up in England last week, to around 13 per 100,000 people, from 11 per 100,000 the previous week.  The uptick in cases comes as the U.K. lifted the last of its Covid travel restrictions. As of Friday morning, people entering the U.K. are no longer required to test for the virus or complete a passenger locator form.  The prevalence of the omicron BA.2 subvariant was said to have increased last week across England, Scotland and Wales, according to the ONS, while the number of omicron BA.1 subvariant infections decreased.  The BA.2 variant has been described as a ""stealth"" variant because it has genetic mutations that could make it harder to distinguish from the delta variant using PCR tests, compared with the original omicron variant, BA.1.  Indeed, the rise in cases across Europe more broadly is being attributed to the BA.2 subvariant.    Cases were found to be rising across the U.K, with Scotland estimated to have had around 7% of its population testing positive for Covid last week, up from 5.7% the week prior.  The case rate in Wales was estimated to have risen to 4.1% from 3.2% over the same period.  ONS said the percentage of cases in Northern Ireland had increased in the two weeks up to March 12 but the trend was uncertain in the most recent week.  The number of deaths linked to Covid-19 across the U.K. fell to 814 in the last week, down from 879 for the week through to March 4.  Elsewhere, China is also dealing with its worst Covid-19 outbreak since the initial phase of the pandemic. "
Russia-Ukraine war: See photos of Ukrainians affected by invasion,2022-03-27 17:34:43+00:00,"Russia's war in Ukraine just passed the one-month mark.  Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded his former Soviet neighbor on Feb. 24, an unprovoked act that has led to carnage across the country. The war has displaced more than 3.7 million Ukrainians, mostly women and children.  As desperate Ukrainians flee their homes to neighboring NATO member countries — Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania — Russian forces pummel the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv and Mariupol with missiles and artillery.  Since the invasion, the United Nations has confirmed 1,081 civilian deaths and 1,707 injuries in Ukraine but says the real toll is likely higher, Reuters reported. Ukraine says 136 children have been killed, the agency reported.  Here is a look at some of the faces and lives affected by Russia's horrific war.

Here's how Covid-19 transitions from a pandemic to endemic,2022-03-18 17:52:11+00:00,"It's been two years since Covid-19 crept across the globe, battered the U.S. economy and wreaked havoc on health-care systems unprepared to defend themselves against the novel pathogen.  Now, as the latest wave of infections driven by the fast-spreading omicron variant rapidly subsides, many are beginning to question: Is Covid-19 becoming endemic?  ""There's a high probability we're moving into an endemic setting,"" Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC's 'Squawk Box' in late February.  But what does it mean when a virus like Covid-19 becomes endemic? That can be unclear—even among global health experts.  ""We're going from the acute phase, the emergency phase, to a chronic phase where we're going to have to look at long term sustained means of continuing to combat Covid-19,"" World Health Organization spokesperson Margaret Harris told CNBC in an interview.  Meanwhile, the Biden administration recently unveiled a 96-page national preparedness plan it thinks will serve as a roadmap to return the nation to more normal routines. The White House's pandemic playbook is already facing hurdles on Capitol Hill.  Lawmakers in Congress dropped additional Covid funding in their latest $1.5 trillion spending bill. The aid is critical for ensuring future supply of booster doses, antiviral pills, tests and more, according to administration officials.  Watch the video above to find out what it means when a virus like Covid-19 becomes endemic, and how the U.S. is trying to forge its post-pandemic future. "
Live updates: Latest news on Russia and the war in Ukraine,2022-03-21 18:15:35+00:00,"This is CNBC's live blog tracking developments on the war in Ukraine. See below for the latest updates.   More than 90% of Ukrainians believe their country will win the war with Russia, a poll by local research institute Rating Group showed. The survey of 1,000 respondents also found that 74% support direct talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.  The United Nations says 10 million Ukrainians have fled their homes, including those who have left the country and others who remain within the border.  Meanwhile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a direct appeal to Moscow and the people of Russia, claiming 14,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the invasion began. Zelenskyy also warned of dire consequences if ongoing ceasefire talks with Russia fail.  And, according to Mariupol's city council, Russian bombs fell on an art school in the city where about 400 residents were in hiding.  The Hong Kong-listed shares of Rusal, a Russian aluminum producer, dropped by as much as 8.9% following an announcement by the Australian government that it would ban exports of alumina to Russia.  Several Australian ministries on Sunday jointly announced a ban on exports of alumina and aluminum ores including bauxite to Russia.  The ban is part of Australia's sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.  Last week, Canberra sanctioned two Russian oligarchs who have links to Australia's mining industry, Reuters reported. One was Oleg Deripaska, who holds a stake in Queensland Alumina, a joint venture between Rusal and Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto.  The Sydney-traded shares of Rio Tinto edged higher on Monday.  — Ted Kemp  Russian forces advancing on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv from the north-east have ""stalled,"" according to the UK Defense Ministry's latest intelligence update.  ""Heavy fighting continues north of Kyiv,"" the ministry said, adding that the city ""remains Russia's primary military objective"" despite a continued lack of progress.  ""Forces advancing from the direction of Hostomel to the north-west have been repulsed by fierce Ukrainian resistance.""  The bulk of Russia's forces remain more than 25 kilometers from the center of the city, according to the ministry.  — Eustance Huang  Some 93% of Ukrainian survey respondents believe their country will win the war against Russia, according to a poll conducted by local research institute Rating Group.  Nearly half of those surveyed hope the war will end over the next few weeks, while almost a quarter of the respondents believe the conflict will last several months.  Rating Group polled 1,000 Ukrainians who are 18 years and above from all regions, except Crimea and Donbas.  The survey also found that 74% of respondents are supportive of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's direct talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, but 89% are against a temporary truce that doesn't include a Russian troop withdrawal.  — Abigail Ng  President Joe Biden will be heading to Poland on Friday to discuss how to support Ukraine following ""Russia's unjustified and unprovoked war on Ukraine,"" the White House said.  He will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw to discuss the global response to the unfolding humanitarian and human rights crisis in Ukraine. Their bilateral meeting will take place after Biden's meetings with NATO allies, G-7 leaders and European Union leaders in Brussels.  Poland has received the bulk of the 3.3 million Ukrainians who have fled their country since the start of the war. According to the UN Refugee Agency, Poland has taken in more than two million Ukrainian refugees.  — Joanna Tan  China does not want to take a strong position on Ukraine that could undermine Russia, said Scott Kennedy of Washington D.C.-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.  It doesn't appear that Beijing has yet provided any military assistance to Moscow or violated the economic sanctions on Russia, he said.  ""But they've not said no. And I think what the U.S. is trying to do is make sure that doesn't happen. And they just can't get a yes out of the Chinese [or] any kind promise,"" Kennedy told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday.  President Joe Biden spoke to Xi for nearly two hours on Friday regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He warned China of global backlash and ""consequences"" if Beijing helps Russia on its war against Ukraine.  — Sumathi Bala  Russia called on Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms in the eastern port city of Mariupol, Reuters reports.  ""Lay down your arms,"" Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, the director of the Russian National Center for Defense Management, said in a briefing distributed by Russia's defense ministry, according to Reuters. ""All who lay down their arms are guaranteed safe passage out of Mariupol.""  Mizintsev also claimed in the briefing that humanitarian corridors for civilians would be opened to the east and the west out of Mariupol at 10 a.m. Moscow time (3 a.m. ET) on Monday.  He said Ukraine has until 5 a.m. Moscow time (10 a.m. ET) on Sunday to lay down arms and accept its offer of humanitarian corridors. Mizintsev, without providing evidence, said Ukrainian ""bandits,"" ""neo-Nazis"" and nationalists had engaged in ""mass terror"" in Mariupol, Reuters reports.  —Terri Cullen  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he planned to discuss advancing Ukraine's interests at the NATO and G-7 meetings this week, according to a Downing Street readout of the call.  Johnson also requested a battlefield assessment as well as an update on the ongoing negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian officials.  ""Both leaders stressed the continued importance of sanctions in exerting pressure on Putin and they condemned the abhorrent attacks on innocent civilians, following the appalling bombings in Mariupol,"" a Downing Street spokesperson wrote in a statement.  ""The two leaders agreed to step up their direct communication even further in the days to come,"" the spokesperson added.  –Amanda Macias  Since the Kremlin's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, NATO has readied 140,000 troops in the region and mobilized a colossal war chest of advanced military equipment in preparation.  The U.S. service members and NATO troops are currently deployed in neighboring NATO member countries and are not directly fighting with Russian forces inside Ukraine.  The alliance, which has more than 140 warships at the ready as well as 130 aircraft on heightened alert, has previously warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that an attack on a NATO member state will be viewed as an attack on all, triggering the group's cornerstone Article 5.  Ukraine, which has sought NATO membership since 2002, is bordered by four NATO allies; Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. Poland currently hosts the majority of the troops from the 30-member alliance and has thus far taken the lion's share of refugees fleeing Putin's war.  —Amanda Macias  The Chornobyl Nuclear Plant said that some employees were able to rotate out or leave after having been forced to work for more than 3 weeks straight following the Russian takeover of the facility.  As of Saturday, 64 people were evacuated, according to a translation of a Facebook post. At the same time, 46 people volunteered to replace some of the employees to maintain an appropriate level of safety.  The rotations come after the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned he was ""gravely concerned"" with the difficult circumstances the staff was facing at the site.  —Jessica Bursztynsky  The war in Ukraine has caused 10 million Ukrainians to flee their homes, including those who have left the country and others who remain within the border, the head of the U.N.'s refugee agency said.   ""Among the responsibilities of those who wage war, everywhere in the world, is the suffering inflicted on civilians who are forced to flee their homes,"" Filippo Grandi said on Twitter.   More than 3.3 million people have fled the country as of Saturday, according to data from the U.N. The bulk of those have sough refuge in Poland, with others travelling to neighboring countries such as Romania, Moldova, Hungary and Slovakia.  The U.N. had initially predicted 4 million people would leave Ukraine to escape the violence.   —Jessica Bursztynsky  Pope Francis called Russia's attacks on Ukraine a ""senseless massacre where every day there is a repetition of slaughter and atrocities.  ""There is no justification for this! I plead with the international community to truly commit to ending this abhorrent war,"" the Pope tweeted in English, Ukrainian and Russian.  ""This week again missiles and bombs have fallen on civilians, the elderly, children, and pregnant mothers. All this is inhuman!,"" he said. ""Indeed, it is also sacrilegious because it goes against the sacredness of human life, and this comes before any strategy!""  —Leslie Josephs  Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse accused the Biden administration of moving too slowly on providing weapons to Ukraine as it tries to fight off Russian attacks.  ""We don't need to have fighter pilots in the air. We don't need to have boots on the ground inside Ukraine because Ukrainians have the will to fight,"" Sasse, a Republican and member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We need to have the will to rearm them constantly.""  Sasse defended his vote against an omnibus legislation that included Ukraine aid, saying the aid totaled less than 1% of the package.  — Leslie Josephs  Russian forces have killed at least 902 civilians, including 75 children, since it began its invasion of Ukraine, the United Nations said.  At least an additional 1,459 people have been injured, including 98 children, from Feb. 24 through March 19, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The majority of casualties recorded have been caused by the use of explosive weapons with a ""wide impact area,"" the agency said. That includes shelling from heavy artillery and air strikes.  The agency said it believes the actual number of casualties are ""considerably higher,"" since information from areas with intense fighting is delayed and some reports are being corroborated.  —Jessica Bursztynsky  The Russian government is essentially feeding its soldiers ""into a wood chipper"" as it continues its invasion on Ukraine, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""  Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed about 14,700 Russian armed forces have been killed since the start of the invasion.  It's been extremely difficult to pinpoint the number of Russian deaths. American intelligence estimates more than 7,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, The New York Times said Wednesday. Russia, meanwhile, has claimed fewer than 500 deaths, the paper reported.  ""It's had the effect of him moving his forces into a wood chipper,"" Austin said of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""The Ukrainians have continued to attrite his forces and they've been very effective using the equipment we've provided them.""  Russia's campaign now has ""essentially stalled,"" with Putin being unable ""to achieve the goals as rapidly as he wants to achieve them.""  —Jessica Bursztynsky  Experts say a $50 million Colorado mansion owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich would likely be among the first assets frozen if he is sanctioned by the White House in response to the war in Ukraine, CNBC's Robert Frank reports.  Abramovich owns a 14,000-square-foot home on 200 acres in Snowmass, Colorado, near Aspen. The Russian billionaire bought the property in 2008 for $36.5 million. Abramovich also owns a 5,500-square-foot home in Snowmass Village, which he purchased in 2008 for $11.8 million.  Struggling with a lack of supply of mega-homes near Aspen, real-estate brokers hungry for listings are likely trying to reach out to Abramovich to get him to sell, according to Riley Warwick, co-founder of Aspen-based brokerage team Saslove & Warwick at Douglas Elliman Real Estate.   ""A lot of my clients have been asking about it,"" he said.  —Terri Cullen  President Joe Biden will not be visiting Ukraine during his upcoming Europe trip, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter.  ""The trip will be focused on continuing to rally the world in support of the Ukrainian people and against President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, but there are no plans to travel into Ukraine,"" Psaki said.  Biden is set to meet with European leaders at a NATO summit in Brussels on March 24. Biden's first trip to Europe since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine comes after Vice President Kamala Harris visited Poland and Romania. But some have been calling on Biden to visit Ukraine, after leaders from Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia visited the capital of Kyiv.  ""The president is going to Europe, and he will be meeting with all of our partners and allies there. I have not seen any discussions of going into Ukraine. But you have to remember, we have discouraged Americans from going into Ukraine. This is a country at war, I can't imagine that that would be on the table,"" U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said earlier in the day on CNN's ""State of the Union.""  —Jessica Bursztynsky  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushed back against Russia's false claim the country needs to be ""de-Nazified,"" saying President Vladimir Putin is extremely deep in a misinformation bubble.  ""Putin is in an information bubble, I think this is an information bunker. It is so powerful, this bunker of information, that he really thinks that Ukrainians are neo-Nazis,"" Zelenskyy told CNN's Fareed Zakaria.  Russia has used the idea of demilitarizing and ""de-Nazifying"" Ukraine as one of its pretexts for war. Zelenskyy, who is Jewish and whose family members were killed in the Holocaust, said the idea of Ukrainians being neo-Nazis is ""laughable,"" but he fears what else Putin ""is capable of doing for his mission.""  ""They cannot just say about their feelings that Ukraine is a betrayer or that we are neo-Nazis, because Russians are acting in the same manner as neo-Nazis at the moment,"" Zelenskyy said.  —Jessica Bursztynsky  A local resident retrieves what he can from his destroyed apartment, located in a five-story residential building that partially collapsed after shelling the day before.  —Getty Images  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country won't give up the two pro-Russian republics in the eastern region of the country or the Russian-annexed Crimea.  Russia has demanded that Ukraine recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk. It's also called on Ukraine to recognize Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, as Russian territory.  ""You cannot just demand Ukraine to recognize some territories as republics, these compromises are simply wrong,"" Zelenskyy told CNN's Fareed Zakaria.  —Jessica Bursztynsky  The Australian government said it would ban exports of alumina and aluminum ores to Russia as part of its sanctions against the country for invading Ukraine.  The move will limit the country's capacity to produce aluminum, ""a critical export for Russia,"" said the statement.  Australia provides 20% of Russia's alumina needs, according to the government.  Russia's Rusal International is the world's second-largest aluminum producer, according to Reuters.  —John Melloy  Russia's military claims it fired Kinzhal hypersonic missiles on Ukrainian targets again, this time hitting a fuel depot in Kostiantynivka, defense ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement posted to the Kremlin's Telegram channel, according to NBC News and the AP.  Russia said it used the Kinzhal for the first time in combat on Saturday to target an ammunition depot in Western Ukraine. CNBC could not independently verify Russia's claims of using the missile.  Russian officials say the missiles can reach targets some 1,240 miles away, according to the BBC.  Konashenkov said Russia also launched cruise missiles from warships from the Caspian sea on the fuel depot strike.   —Leslie Josephs  Civilians trapped in Mariupol city under Russian attacks, are evacuated in groups under the control of pro-Russian separatists. Men were being checked before being allowed to leave the city.  -Anadolu Agency  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that if peace talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin fail, it would mean the start of a third global war.   ""If these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third world war,"" Zelenskyy said in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria that aired Sunday morning.   Ukrainian and Russian officials have met intermittently for peace talks, which have failed to progress to key concessions. Still, Zelenksyy has called for another round of talks with Moscow.   ""I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,"" Zelenskyy said. ""If there is just 1% chance for us to stop this war, we need to take this chance.""  —Jessica Bursztynsky  Reuters reports that the front lines between Ukrainian and Russian forces are ""practically frozen,"" citing a video address by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych. The reason for the stalemate is that Russia doesn't have enough combat strength to push further into Ukraine, he said.  ""(Over the past day) there were practically no rocket strikes on (Ukrainian) cities,"" Arestovych said, according to Reuters.  —Terri Cullen  Prominent politicians and officials have sharply rebuked Boris Johnson after the British prime minister tried to draw comparisons between the war in Ukraine and the 2016 Brexit vote.  Speaking Saturday, Johnson said that it was the instinct of Britons, like Ukrainians, to choose freedom. ""I can give you a couple of famous recent examples. When the British people voted for Brexit, in such large, large numbers, I don't believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners. It's because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself,"" Johnson said.  The comments were branded tasteless by opposition figures in the U.K., while former president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said his words would offend Ukrainians.  —Matt Clinch  Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, spoke to Sky News this morning saying the situation in her country is growing ""more and more severe.""  She alleged that Moscow has committed ""nearly all possible war crimes that humanity has seen.""  She added: ""The number of civilian victims is far more than those from the armed forces of Ukraine.""  ""Ukraine will resist as long as it is needed to make sure no terror, no genocide is committed on this land in the 21st century.""

One includes Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia in the Donetsk region, with private cars of Mariupol residents being refueled in Berdyansk on the way to Zaporizhzhia.  —Matt Clinch  Russian bombs fell on an art school in the city of Mariupol where about 400 residents were in hiding, according to Mariupol's city council.  The council said the building was destroyed and ""peaceful people are still under the rubble,"" adding that there were women, children and the elderly. CNBC and NBC News could not confirm if the report was accurate. ""Information on the number of victims is being clarified,"" the council said on its official Telegram channel.  Earlier Sunday, President Zelenskyy said in a televised address that more than 4,000 residents in the besieged city of Mariupol managed to leave for Zaporizhzhya.  He said the Mariupol blockade ""will go down in history"" as a war crime. ""To do such a thing with a peaceful city that the occupiers did is the terror that will be remembered even in centuries.""   —Matt Clinch  Ukraine's president made a direct appeal to Moscow and the people of Russia early on Sunday morning, claiming 14,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the invasion began.  In his latest speech, Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke in Russian saying: ""This is 14,000 mothers ...This is 14,000 fathers. These are wives, these are children, relatives and friends.""  ""And you don't notice it? But there will only be more victims. As long as this war continues. Your war is against us, Russia against Ukraine. On our land,"" he said, according to an NBC News translation.  CNBC or NBC News has not independently verified the death toll. Estimates of Russian deaths have varied since the war started.  —Matt Clinch  Russia has made limited progress in capturing Ukraine's eastern cities even though the Kremlin continues to encircle a number of those cities, according to the latest intelligence by the U.K. Defense Ministry.  ""Instead, Russia has increased its indiscriminate shelling of urban areas resulting in widespread destruction and large numbers of civilian casualties,"" the ministry said in a Twitter post.  It warned there could be increased civilian casualties as Russia will likely ""continue to use its heavy firepower to support assaults on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses.""  —Joanna Tan  China is on the right side of history with regard to the Ukraine crisis — and time will prove it, said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to Chinese state media.  ""We have always stood for maintaining peace and opposing war,"" Wang said, according to CGTN News.  His comments came after the Friday meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S President Joe Biden, during which Biden warned of ""consequences"" if China were to provide material support to the Kremlin in its war against Ukraine.  Speaking to reporters a day after the U.S.-China meeting, Wang said Beijing will make its own assessment of the situation in an objective and fair manner.  ""We will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and we will also oppose any groundless accusations or suspicions targeted against China,"" he added.  Beijing has so far refrained from condemning Russia, and has refused to call the violence in Ukraine an ""invasion.""  —Joanna Tan  Russian progress 'significantly blunted' amid failure to control Ukraine airspace; China says it's on the right side of history "
Saudi Aramco full-year profit more than doubles on soaring oil prices,2022-03-20 09:19:31+00:00,"Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco reported blowout full-year earnings on Sunday, posting a more than doubling in year-on-year net profit to $110 billion.  Aramco's 2021 net income increased by 124% to $110 billion in 2021, compared to $49 billion in 2020, citing higher crude oil prices, stronger refining and chemicals margins, and the consolidation of its chemicals business, SABIC's, full-year results.   The numbers were in line with expectations, with analysts surveyed by Reuters forecasting net income of $109.7 billion for the full year. Aramco shares on the Saudi Tadawul Exchange rose almost 4% in Sunday trading after the result.  ""Our strong results are a testament to our financial discipline, flexibility through evolving market conditions and steadfast focus on our long-term growth strategy, which targets value growth for our shareholders,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said in the results release.  Aramco benefitted from surging oil prices during 2021, with international benchmark Brent crude rising above $80 a barrel by the end of the year, up roughly 50% for the 12-month period. Supply shortages added to a complex slew of factors driving major uncertainty across the energy and commodity complex, even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   ""Although economic conditions have improved considerably, the outlook remains uncertain due to various macro-economic and geopolitical factors,"" he added. It comes after the IEA warned that the oil market was heading for its ""biggest supply crisis in decades"" as Russian sanctions hit and buyers shun its exports.  ""We see healthy oil demand. Unfortunately there is shrinking global spare capacity, combined with low inventories and a lack of investment,"" Nasser said on an earnings call Sunday. He also blamed ""a transition plan that is totally unrealistic"" for the current pricing dynamic.   The result and earnings call also came just hours after Saudi authorities confirmed another attack on Aramco facilities on Sunday, with Houthi rebels using missiles and drones to target at least six sites across Saudi Arabia, including an Aramco fuel depot and a liquefied natural gas plant.  ""There were no injuries or fatalities, and no impact on the company's supplies to customers,"" Nasser said.   ""We've demonstrated our ability to respond swiftly and effectively,"" Nasser said, pointing to Aramco's response to a major attack on its facilities in 2019. ""We were able to restore operations rapidly, while ensuring reliability of supply to our customers.""   Aramco also declared a fourth quarter dividend of $18.8 billion, to be paid in the first quarter of 2022. The dividend is covered by a rise in free-cash flow to $107.5 billion in 2021, compared to $49.1 billion in 2020.   Aramco said it would recommend that $4 billion in retained earnings be used to pay bonus shares to investors, subject to approval. Under the recommendation, shareholders would receive one bonus share for every 10 shares owned. As a result, the total dividend for 2021 is $75 billion in cash, in addition to bonus shares.   The profit figures are a stark contrast from the company's 2020 earnings, which saw a 44% drop on the previous year due to demand collapse brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.   Nasser at the time described Aramco's 2020 financial year as one of its most ""challenging years"" in recent history.   The company also said it would invest to increase crude oil production capacity to 13 million barrels per day by 2027, expand its liquid to chemical production, and look to increase gas production by more than 50% by 2030.   Aramco has also said it wants to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across its wholly-owned operated assets by 2050. Scope 1 refers to direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company, while Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased power consumed by the company.  ""We're doing our part, but it's not enough. Other players in the industry also need to do their part and increase investment,"" Nasser said, saying demand for oil will continue to accelerate in coming years.   Capital expenditure in 2021 was $31.9 billion, an increase of 18% from 2020, primarily driven by increased activities in relation to crude oil increments, the Tanajib Gas Plant and development drilling programs. Aramco expects 2022 capital expenditure to be approximately $40-50 billion, with further growth expected until around the middle of the decade.    "

"North Korea fires multiple-rocket launcher, South Korea says",2022-03-20 05:32:33+00:00,"North Korea appeared to have fired a short-range multiple rocket launcher on Sunday, South Korea's military said, amid heightened military tensions on the peninsula after a spate of larger missile launches by the nuclear-armed North.   While they garner much less attention than the massive intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), North Korea has displayed several new types of multiple launch rocket systems in recent years, adding to an already large arsenal of artillery and rockets ideal for potentially striking targets in the South.   ""This morning there was firing in North Korea which is assumed to be multiple rocket launcher shots, and our military was monitoring the related situation and maintaining a readiness posture,"" South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, without elaborating.   North Korea's military fired four shots around 7:20 a.m. (2220 GMT on Saturday) for about an hour toward its west coast from an unidentified location in South Pyongan Province, Yonhap news agency reported.   South Korea's National Security Council held an emergency vice-ministerial meeting over the launches.   Last year South Korea approved plans to pursue a $2.6-billion artillery interception system, similar to Israel's ""Iron Dome,"" designed to protect against North Korea's arsenal of long-range guns and rockets.  About half of South Korea's 52 million people live in the capital Seoul and the surrounding areas, within range of the neighbor's long-range guns and multiple rocket launchers.   Pyongyang has conducted an unusually high pace of missile launches this year. South Korea and the United States warn that the North could resume test-firing its largest ICBMs for the first time since 2017 amid stalled denuclearization talks.   North Korea also appears to be preparing to launch a spy satellite, and new construction has been spotted at its shuttered nuclear test site. "
Cost of charging EV vs. gas prices,2022-03-20 19:59:26+00:00,"It has been true for years: Mile for mile, it's cheaper — generally much cheaper — to recharge an electric vehicle than it is to refuel one with an internal-combustion engine.  That has been a key selling point for Tesla and other EV makers, particularly in times when gas prices have soared, such as now. But this time there's a wrinkle: While gas prices have indeed soared in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, so have electricity prices — particularly in some parts of the U.S. that have been big markets for Tesla's EVs.  That raises a question: Is it still true that it's much cheaper to ""refuel"" an EV? The charts below, which show how much the cost to add 100 miles of range to the average EV or internal-combustion vehicle has changed in different markets over time, help us find the answer.  The first chart, using nationwide figures, provides a baseline. The others use data specific to Boston and San Francisco, two markets where EVs are popular — and where electricity tends to be more expensive than the national average.  The answer in all three cases is that — even with regional surges in the price of electricity — it's still quite a bit more expensive to fill your gas tank than it is to charge your EV's battery.  Electricity rates have roughly kept pace with gas price increases in Boston and San Francisco. Yet, on average across the U.S., adding 100 miles of range in your internal-combustion vehicle has become more expensive, relative to charging an EV an equivalent amount, over the last couple of months.  Wall Street banks pick their top semiconductor stocks as electric vehicle production soars  Forget Tesla — this auto stock is the one to buy right now, analyst says  Europe's moving away from Russian energy — and that could boost EV charging stocks  Is that likely to change? While oil prices are nearly certain to fall in the coming months as producers increase output, it's unlikely that the price of electricity will rise enough to make EVs less affordable over their life cycles than internal-combustion alternatives.  Using February data, Jeffries analyst David Kelley recently calculated that the total lifetime cost of ownership of an EV is about $4,700 less than that of an internal-combustion vehicle. He said that cost difference is likely to increase as more EVs come to market — and as battery prices continue to fall — over the next couple of years.  We had three questions in mind when we put together these charts:  For gasoline, the Environmental Protection Agency reported that the average new vehicle sold in the U.S. in 2020 had a combined fuel-economy rating of 25.7 miles per gallon. Driving 100 miles in that average vehicle would use 3.9 gallons of gas. (Figures for 2021 haven't been released yet.)  On the electric-vehicle side, the EPA's efficiency rating for EVs — called ""MPGe"", for miles per gallon equivalent — gives consumers an idea of how far an EV can travel on 33.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of charge. Why 33.7 kWh? That's the amount of electricity that is chemically equivalent to the energy in a gallon of regular gasoline.  The average MPGe rating for 2022-model-year EVs sold in the U.S. is about 97, so driving 100 miles in that hypothetical average vehicle would use 34.7 kWh of electricity.  The charts above compare how the price of 3.9 gallons of gas has changed relative to the price of 34.7 kWh over time, using monthly data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (for gas prices) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (for electricity rates) from February 2019 through February 2022.  —CNBC's Crystal Mercedes contributed to this article.

"Psychologist: Parents who raise resilient, socially intelligent kids do 5 things during 'hard times'",2022-03-21 14:21:01+00:00,"We all want to raise resilient, confident and socially intelligent kids. As a psychologist who specializes in adolescent development, I've found that the key is for parents to provide reassurance starting at a young age.   Kids, especially teens and tweens, sometimes need validation that what they are thinking and feeling is normal and okay. In fact, psychologists believe that validation is one of the most powerful parenting tools, and yet it is often left out of traditional behavioral parent training programs.  Validating your child's feelings doesn't necessarily mean you condone or agree with the actions they take. It simply means showing that you hear, understand and accept them. This can help teach them to effectively label their own emotions and be more in tune with their social environments, thereby increasing emotional intelligence.   Here's how successful parents convey these important messages during hard times:  Friendships help children develop important life skills like getting along with other people and solving conflicts. But no friendship is perfect.  Remind your child that all friendships go through ups and downs. In lasting relationships, close friends inevitably disappoint, irritate or mess up occasionally.  If your kid is receptive, tell them about similar social heartaches that their sister, cousin, or you endured at their age. These stories are irrefutable evidence that they are not alone and should not feel ashamed.  Unless your kid recoils at touch, physical comfort may be more immediate and impactful than any verbal assurance.  Several studies have found benefits of interpersonal touch. For example, being hugged can lower blood pressure and instill a feeling of care and safety.  Let's say your kid is feeling upset about something. Before saying a single word, you might want to rub their back, give them a hug or hold their hand. A fifth grader once told her mother: ""When I'm sad, I just need you to give me a big hug and say, 'Yeah, that really sucks. It's awful.'""  Not starting conversations right away also gives your kid time to prepare to talk about their distress.   Tweens often gauge self-worth by how many friends they have. They don't recognize yet that the quality of relationships matters more. One study found that teens who had many — but more superficial — school friends became more anxious as young adults.   Plus, contrary to what most kids think, being popular doesn't alleviate loneliness. Popularity, a social status that is driven by exerting power through rumors and put-downs, is inherently unstable and therefore difficult to maintain.  Reassure your kid that they do not need hundreds of friends, on either social media or in real life. A few will suffice, as long as they are loyal, trustworthy and supportive.   Research demonstrates that along with peer acceptance, at least one strong, healthy friendship predicts both good school performance and psychological well-being (e.g., high self-esteem and less anxiety).  I often see kids dwell on one social slight or disappointment, which in that moment looms larger and more pressing than all the positives in their lives.  While empathizing with your child's distress, refocusing their attention on their most recent triumphs and pleasures lets them appreciate the bigger and brighter picture.  Tell your kid that although they are going through a rough time now, it will not last forever. Things will get better. This is not a platitude. Social situations will change because kids will change.  They just need to be patient while they and their peers mature. If they try to make changes in their friendships, for example, remind them that turning things around takes time. But for now, what they can control is how they act in socially challenging situations.   Studies of high school students demonstrate the value of social hope. In one study, freshmen students were asked to read a short brain science article about how personality can change. Then they read anecdotes seniors had written about eventually learning to shrug off and move on from peer conflicts.   Finally, the group was asked to write encouraging advice to younger students.  After stressful talks, the intervention group had 10% lower levels of cortisol than the control group, indicating that students who read inspiring information coped better. At the end of the school year, these freshmen were 40% less likely to be depressed and earned better grades than control students.

Damage to the wiring of the cars could result in airbags deploying ""later than designed,"" which could lead to injury of people in the vehicle, according to a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The wiring issue could also cause other problems in the cars, including the vehicle's windows rolling down on their own and its electronic parking brake inadvertently engaging at low speeds.  Currently, the company does not have a fix for the issue, according to the report, however Volkswagen will offer a reimbursement program for recalled vehicles.  The recall includes the 2019 through 2023 Volkswagen Atlas, as well as the 2020 through 2023 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport.  Volkswagen will notify owners and dealers by mail on May 10, 2022, if their vehicles are included in the recall. The company will also reach out again when a fix is developed so owners can bring in their SUVs for repair.

New survey says these are the 3 most annoying co-worker habits,2022-03-19 14:15:01+00:00,"The relationships you have with your co-workers are some of the most important – and complicated – ones you'll have in your life. These people can be trusted confidantes, mentors or allies that help you climb the corporate ladder.   But a bad colleague can make you dread going to work, even if you love your job. In fact, new research from Quality Logo Products has found that more than 90% of Americans have a co-worker that annoys them, and 57% of people have considered quitting, or left their jobs, because of an annoying co-worker.  The company surveyed 1,902 U.S.-based employees in February about the behaviors they find most irritating in their colleagues.   Working from home hasn't done much to alleviate the tension either, as 55% of people reported that they still get annoyed with their co-workers several times a week in a remote vs. in office environment.  Their top pet peeves for remote colleagues include slow responses to emails or instant messages, excessive background noise on calls, and eating on camera.   Here are the three most annoying co-worker habits according to Quality Logo Products and how to handle them:   Interruptions are one of the most common problems in virtual meetings as it's hard to tell when someone's about to unmute their microphone, done speaking or dealing with an internet lag.   ""We all have to have some grace around technological issues when we're on calls,"" career coach Letisha Bereola tells CNBC Make It. ""Interruptions are almost inevitable at this point, so try to brush it off and not take it too personally.""   If you're dealing with a chronic interrupter, however, career coach Susan Peppercorn suggests politely calling attention to the issue. For example, if someone cuts you off in a meeting, you can say, ""Could you please let me finish? Then I'll turn the floor back to you.""  You might notice that other people on your team are introverts, or might struggle with speaking up for themselves, too – in that case, Peppercorn says you should ""appeal to the interrupter's pride"" as confronting them could come off as hostile or rude.   She suggests the following script: ""I notice there are people on our team who don't speak up a lot – could you help boost the voice of some of those people at our next meeting? So if someone interrupts [insert name here], could you help her get the floor back?""   Is there anything more infuriating than working hard on a project, only to have a co-worker claim it as their own? If it's a first-time offense, give them the benefit of the doubt, Bereola says, as it could have been an honest mistake.   But if it happens again, find a gracious entrance into the conversation and clearly state that you came up with the idea/project/suggestion. These templates can help you take ownership:  ""As [co-worker] was saying, my idea to [explain project] would result in [impact].""  ""Thank you for bringing that up, [co-worker], I know I shared this with you [date you spoke about the idea].""   Peppercorn also suggests talking with your manager if it's a project that you're passionate about or could impact your performance review, and keeping a paper trail of your projects so you have documented proof of your contributions.   Being open about your life and hobbies can help strengthen your work relationships, but there's a fine line between healthy banter and getting too personal.   Politics, Covid-19, money, religion and relationships ranked as the most annoying topics to discuss with a co-worker in Quality Logo Products' research.   These issues can often be emotionally charged and quickly lead to arguments among co-workers, so it's smart to be mindful of how often you bring them up with colleagues, and try to avoid office gossip at all costs, Peppercorn warns.   If a non-work-related conversation starts to ""go off the rails,"" she adds, pivot to asking your co-worker about a project they're working on, or call attention to something else in business news.   Or, just disengage. ""If you can leave the conversation by saying that you need to jump on another call, or if it's a group, stay silent, then do that,"" Bereola says.

Putin's Russia looks increasingly desperate as Ukraine war drags: Analysts,2022-03-21 15:57:22+00:00,"With Russia's invasion of Ukraine now approaching its fourth week, President Vladimir Putin's forces have exerted brutal force and destruction on the Eastern European nation, forcing people to flee and making millions homeless.  Russia's economy is now creaking under the immense weight of international sanctions and the costs of war, having largely failed to achieve major military victories in Ukraine. Close watchers of Moscow, and Putin, say there are increasing signs of desperation in Russia's military campaign and siege tactics.  ""I don't think Russia can win,"" Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told CNBC.  ""They're bogged down. They're having trouble with supplies. They are having trouble with ammunition. They are not able to take the major cities. They're not advancing. They are showing a lot of desperate measures like calling in Syrians or asking the Chinese for help, or threatening to attack the NATO countries' [weapons] supplies [to Ukraine] and raising the specter of biological or chemical or nuclear use,"" he noted.  ""These are all signs of, I think, desperation,"" Volker told CNBC on Friday, adding that they are getting squeezed between military failure on the ground, and the failure of Russia's economy due to the sanctions. ""And so time is working against them now,"" he said.  Volker said that Russia's desperation for a quick win in Ukraine means that it is now resorting to what he described as ""barbarian tactics"" including ""targeting civilians directly, shelling cities"" to try to create ""fear and exhaustion in the population.""  Russia has failed to take the capital of Kyiv and to unseat President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government, with a massive military convoy that snaked toward the city over recent weeks still dispersed on the outskirts, while Ukraine's forces have managed to resist Russian attempts to seize the country's second-largest city Kharkiv in the northeast, quite a feat given its proximity to the Russian border.  The western city of Lviv, meanwhile, has seen its airport targeted by Russian shelling, as well as a nearby military facility, but so far the city — which has become a major conduit for Ukrainians fleeing to Eastern Europe — has been relatively unscathed.  In fact, several weeks into its invasion and just one city, Kherson, has fallen to Russian forces.  Faced with this scale and spirit of resistance, there's hope among analysts that Ukraine's forces can continue to withhold, stall and even potentially stop Russia's forces advancing.  ""I've been in touch with people and Kharkiv and Lviv and Kyiv and they are motivated, they are really determined, and they are confident because they see that Russia is not making gains,"" Volker said.  Other analysts fear the war has now entered a period of potentially long, drawn-out fighting with little gained by Russian forces, and little conceded by Ukraine's.  ""The war is pretty much at a stalemate,"" Michal Baranowski, director of the German Marshall Fund's Warsaw office, told CNBC on Monday.  ""Russia was hoping for a quick victory, basically a Blitzkrieg, a quick run to Kyiv with a hope to frankly decapitate the Ukrainian government in the first few days. They failed to do it and so the tactic and strategy has changed into a really grueling, grinding war.""  He said Russia was now relying significantly more on air power and was hitting more civilian targets, such as a theater in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, where civilians were sheltering. Huge signs were painted outside the theater, on the ground, warning that children were in the building and still it was hit. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied that it targets civilians, despite the evidence to the contrary.  ""Russia is unfortunately bombing, probably on purpose, these civilian places in order to break the will of the Ukrainian people,"" Baranowski said.  If one city has become an emblem or symbol of the strength of Ukraine's resistance and resilience in the face of Russia's invasion it is Mariupol.  The city has suffered intense shelling for weeks as well as acute food, water and food shortages that have left hundreds of thousands of people in dire conditions and desperate to escape. While many managed to evacuate the heavily destroyed city last week, intense fighting has continued with street battles taking place at the weekend. Meanwhile, thousands of civilians are still trapped in the city.  Despite its bombardment and suffering, Mariupol has refused Russia's demands — and a deadline set for 5 a.m. on Monday — to surrender.  It's uncertain what Russia, which had said it would allow more civilians to leave if Ukraine had agreed to surrender, will do now its ultimatum to lay down arms has been rejected.  ""Mariupol is almost destroyed, it's Aleppo now in the middle of Europe. It's Stalingrad, giving a 20th century analogy, but those are the tactics of terror,"" Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko told CNBC on Monday.The 2016 Battle of Aleppo, in which Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces — aided and abetted by Russia — took back rebel-held areas of the city after a monthlong aerial bombing campaign, killing hundreds of civilians including children as a result and leaving the city largely in ruins. The battle (and Russia's support) were seen as a turning point in the civil war, and cementing Assad's regime.  Goncharenko said Putin and his forces appear to be resorting to siege tactics to undermine and weaken Ukrainian cities and civilians because of the strength, scale and spirit of Ukraine's resistance.  ""He just can't go further because our army is holding the ground. They [the Russian army] has been around 25 kilometers away from Kyiv for about two and a half weeks now, so they just couldn't go further and it's the same situation in other regions of Ukraine.""  Moreover, he said, counteroffensives had started in parts of the country including Kyiv and in the south, which is a focus for Russian forces trying to join up the Crimean Peninsula, which they annexed in 2014, with the pro-Russian separatist regions in the east of the country, creating a land bridge to Crimea.  Ukraine's resistance had prompted Russia to change strategy and to use more ""terror"" and scare tactics like more indiscriminate mass shelling, Goncharenko said.  He said Ukrainians have the will to stop Putin but they need more assistance from the West.  ""It's our land, it's our country, we don't have any other option. Putin underestimated us and I think that the whole world underestimated us. I saw the news at the beginning [of the war] with U.S. intelligence giving us 96 hours and after this Kyiv will fall but I can assure you, Kyiv will not fail and we will not surrender,"" he said.  Goncharenko noted that more than 100,000 people had joined Ukraine's territorial defense force, a civilian militia, including himself, but he echoed Zelenskyy's call for more sanctions, more weapons and more air power to help defeat Russia.  Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:  ""Thousands of Ukrainians are taking up arms, we will stop Putin — but what will be the price for us and for the whole world,"" he said.  In response to a request for comment, the Russian Ministry of Defense directed CNBC to a statement from more than two weeks ago which said in part that Russian forces carry out strikes only on military targets ""using high-precision weapons.""However, overwhelming photographic and video evidence, as well as official assessments from the U.S., U.K. and others, show that Russia is in fact striking civilian targets with unguided weapons.

China plane crash: 132 people on board Boeing 737 during sudden plunge,2022-03-22 02:48:19+00:00,"A China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board plunged midflight and crashed in a mountainous area of southern China on Monday, according to officials and flight-tracking data.  Flight MU5735 left Kunming at 1:11 p.m. local time (1:11 a.m. ET) and was due to arrive at Guangzhou in the southeast of the country in less than two hours, according to information on FlightRadar24.  The plane was cruising at 29,100 feet and began a sharp descent after 2:20 p.m., recovering more than 1,000 feet briefly then resuming the dive before it lost contact. It fell more than 25,000 feet in about two minutes.  ""This kind of tragedy is extremely unusual,"" Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, said of the plane's sudden, sharp drop from its cruising altitude.  China's Civil Aviation Administration said it sent a team to the Guangxi region. Debris was found but not passengers, state media reported early Tuesday, local time.  Investigators will work to recover so-called black boxes that contain cockpit voice recordings and flight data. They are also likely to examine the aircraft's previous flights, maintenance history, weather data and pilot health.  Chinese state media said the crash had caused a fire in the mountains. Video circulating on social media showed fire and smoke in the mountains and a section of a plane near a dirt path. Chinese officials have yet to confirm any passenger deaths.  If all 123 passengers and nine crew members are confirmed dead, it would be China's deadliest airline crash since 1994 and the deadliest ever for China Eastern Airlines, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.  The 737NG, or Next Generation is the model Boeing released before the Max. It has one of the best safety records of any aircraft with 11 fatal accidents out of more than 7,000 NG planes that have been delivered to customers since 1997, according to aviation data and consulting firm Cirium.  The 737-800 that crashed Monday in China first flew in June 2015. It was not a Boeing 737 Max, the plane that was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.  China Eastern Airlines confirmed the crash and the number of people on board via a statement on Weibo, which is China's version of Twitter. The airline said it is sending workers to the site of the crash and has opened a hotline for family members.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it was aware of the crash and will assist in the investigation ""if asked.""  Typically when a crash takes place, the country where the crash occurs leads the investigation. Because Flight 5735 was a U.S.-made plane, the National Transportation Safety Board has appointed an investigator for the crash.  The NTSB didn't say whether investigators would travel to China.  Boeing as the manufacturer and its regulator, the FAA, will likely assist in the investigation.  ""We have been in close communication with our customer and regulatory authorities since the accident, and have offered the full support of our technical experts to the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China,"" Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun wrote to employees. ""I will keep you apprised of information about the accident as investigation protocols allow. In the meantime, trust that we will be doing everything we can to support our customer and the accident investigation during this difficult time, guided by our commitment to safety, transparency, and integrity at every step.""  China Eastern, China's second-largest carrier by capacity according to OAG, changed the colors of its website and social media accounts to black and white in a sign of mourning.  Chinese President Xi Jinping said he was ""shocked"" to learn of the incident, according to state media CCTV. He instructed Shanghai-based China Eastern to organize search and rescue efforts and begin an investigation into the cause of the crash.  The last fatal commercial passenger airline crash China was in 2010, when 42 people died on a Henan Airlines Embraer E-190 flight, according to the ASN database.  There are more than 4,200 737-800s in service worldwide and 1,177 in Chinese airlines' fleets — the most of any country — according to Cirium.  Boeing has been trying to recover its reputation after the two crashes of the Max. The Boeing 737 Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after the second of the two crashes, occurring within five months of one another.  Indonesia's Lion Air Flight 610 crashed on Oct. 29, 2018, and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 went down on March 10, 2019. All 346 people on board the two flights were killed in the crashes.   China was the first country to ground the Max after the second crash. The U.S. and most other countries cleared the planes to return to service more than a year ago. Chinese regulators allowed the Max to resume flying in December, with changes, but the planes have not yet returned to service.  Boeing shares shed roughly 3.5% in Monday trading. Spirit AeroSystems, which makes 737 fuselages, likewise sold off 3.5%.  Boeing has been preparing to resume deliveries of its best-selling Max plane to China, a crucial milestone since airlines pay the bulk of an aircraft's price upon delivery.  ""If Boeing cannot deliver 737s to China, it will be that much harder to reduce the company's 737 inventory, and this would likely make it more difficult to boost production from the [31 planes per month] planned for this year,"" JP Morgan Boeing analyst Seth Seifman wrote in a note Monday.  Boeing reported its third annual loss in a row in January, disclosing $5.5 billion in costs tied to manufacturing flaws, which have forced the company to pause deliveries of the company's 787 Dreamliners for most of the last 17 months.

Latest news on Russia and the war in Ukraine,2022-03-22 07:18:44+00:00,"This has been CNBC's live blog covering updates on the war in Ukraine. Follow the latest updates here.  Ukraine has rejected an ultimatum to surrender its besieged port city of Mariupol to Russian forces. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Eurovision News that ultimatums won't work as trapped Ukrainians will ""fight till the end.""  Meanwhile, the Pentagon said Ukrainian forces — including civilians — have put up a strong resistance against Russian forces, and the Kremlin is struggling to achieve its goals in Ukraine. ""I think what we're seeing here is the Russians have been flummoxed, they've been frustrated,"" said Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby.  Earlier, Ukrainian authorities said Moscow had demanded Mariupol be handed over by 5 a.m. Russian forces said they would spare the lives of those who complied with their surrender ultimatum and would allow civilians to leave if their demands were met.  Thousands of civilians are trapped in the city, which is running dangerously low on vital supplies like food, water and medicines.  Nearly a month since Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian forces have been unable to achieve their objectives, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.  ""We're on day 26 [and] the Russians have clearly not achieved many, or almost all of the objectives that ... we believe they were setting out to achieve,"" said Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby at a briefing on Monday.  ""They wanted to get after population centers so that they could take control of key ports, key cities, key government institutions,"" he said, adding that the Kremlin wanted to install a government that is ""more friendly to Russia.""  So far, Kirby said, Pentagon leaders believe the Russians have taken Kherson, and the Ukrainians have launched a counterattack there.  ""I think what we're seeing here is the Russians have been flummoxed, they've been frustrated. They have failed to achieve a lot of their objectives on the ground,"" he added.  — Sumathi Bala   Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an interview with Eurovision News that his country will not submit to ultimatums from Russia.  ""People will either leave the city or those who cannot leave will fight till the end. Therefore, an ultimatum, is a bad thing because it will lead to genocide and the destruction of the Ukrainian people,"" he told the European Broadcasting Union, an alliance of public broadcasters, on Monday.  Whether it comes to Ukraine's membership to NATO, or other forms of compromises, it needs to be accepted by the people, Zelenskyy added.  ""When you talk about certain changes and they can be historic, we are not going anywhere. We will come to the referendum. Our people will have to say and give an answer to certain formats of compromises,"" he said. ""What will those be? It will be defined by our conversation and understanding between Ukraine and Russia.""  The president said residents of occupied cities such as Melitopol and Berdyansk will continue to resist Russian forces.  ""We hate these troops who are destroying us and killing our people, [and we hate] their policy. We don't care, if we want peace, we need to sit down and talk,"" he added. ""The right word is to negotiate. Negotiate as you have to. But to negotiate, not to execute ultimatums.""  — Sumathi Bala  Seven-year-old Amellia Anisovych, a refugee from Ukraine, center, sings the Ukraine national anthem at the start of a fund-raising concert in Lodz, Poland, Sunday, March 20, 2022.   Anisovych became widely known for singing a song from the movie Frozen in a bomb shelter in Kyiv in early March. She has since come to Poland with her grandmother and brother.   Her parents remained in Kyiv.  —Associated Press  Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., won't accept future donations from Koch Industries and will contribute what it has recently received to a charity dedicated to providing aid to Ukraine, spokeswoman Deb Barnes told CNBC on Monday.  The move comes after Koch Industries decided to continue doing business in Russia, even as other major U.S. and European companies flee the country to avoid sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.  Schrader's campaign received $4,500 from the Koch Industries' political action committee during the 2022 election cycle, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign donations and spending.  Ethics attorneys say that the donations could represent an effort by Koch to influence lawmakers as they work to provide further help to Ukraine, with some lawyers calling for those on Capitol Hill to return the contributions.  More than two dozen lawmakers saw nearly $110,000 from the Koch Industries PAC in February, as Russian President Vladimir Putin started moving his forces into Ukraine.  — Brian Schwartz  Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. has observed an increase in Russian naval activity in the Black Sea near the Ukrainian city of Odesa.   Kirby said that some of the bombardment around Odesa is coming from a mixture of different types of Russian warships in the sea but was unable to confirm munitions or targets.  ""We just see indications that they have increased their activity in the northern Black Sea. That's not something that we had observed over the last few days,"" Kirby said.  Earlier in the day, a senior Defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters that it was too soon to say whether Russian forces were planning an amphibious assault of Odesa.   – Amanda Macias  U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other Biden administration officials warned business leaders they should be ""prepared for the worst"" as world leaders punish Russia with crippling economic sanctions over President Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine.   Executives across energy, food and manufacturing industries met with Raimondo, President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and others to discuss the war.   While NATO allies are doing everything to pressure Putin to end the war quickly, ""we know that that might not be possible. And so we're also prepared for this to last quite a long time,"" Raimondo told reporters after the meeting.   — Dawn Kopecki     The Pentagon said Russian troops are attempting to encircle the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol but have yet to take it from Ukrainian forces.   ""They clearly want to take Mariupol. It's a city port city there on the Sea of Azov and it's a link between the Donbas area and Crimea,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said during a press conference.   ""You can see why Mariupol might be of interest but the Ukrainians are defending it bravely and have been able to stymie the Russians' efforts to take it,"" he said.  Kirby added that the Russians have attempted to encircle Mariupol from both the north and up its coast.   – Amanda Macias  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia will have to ""destroy us all"" before it will surrender the port city of Mariupol, according to a transcript of an interview he did with several public broadcasters.   Russian National Defense Control Center Head Mikhail Mizintsev has said the Kremlin would allow peaceful civilians to evacuate Mariupol — only after Ukraine's military surrendered the city and left unarmed, NBC News reported.  ""Ukraine cannot fulfill these demands. They would first have to destroy us all to have their ultimatum fulfilled,"" Zelenskyy said in the interview translated by NBC News. ""We would never give Kharkiv, Mariupol or Kyiv. Neither residents of those cities, nor I, the president can do this.""  In a separate nterview with NBC News, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said at least 14 local leaders had been kidnapped or abducted by Russian troops since the invasion began. NBC News has not been able to independently verify that, but Vereshchuk said the abductions include mayors and leaders of the territorial communities.     — Dawn Kopecki  The nearly monthlong Russian war in Ukraine is on the verge of entering a stalemate, said a senior NATO intelligence official, with Ukrainian forces preventing Russia from making progress but Russian President Vladimir Putin showing no willingness to back down.   ""If we're not in a stalemate, we are rapidly approaching one,"" said the NATO official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military assessments. ""The reality is that neither side has a superiority over the other.""  Belarus, a close Russian ally, may soon attack Ukraine itself and is preparing to potentially let Russia position nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil, the official said. Belarus has already allowed Russia's military to use its territory to invade Ukraine.  — NBC News  A senior U.S. Defense official said Russian forces in Ukraine have made little progress in their advance on Kyiv.  The official, who asked not to be named to share details of the combat, said that Russian troops are still approximately 10 to 15 miles outside of Kyiv's city center, a distance Russian forces attained weeks ago and have yet to shorten.  Last week, the same Defense official said it was the Pentagon's belief that Russian forces plan to encircle Kyiv.  The official said the Pentagon has received anecdotal reports of some Russian troops experiencing morale issues but cautioned that the U.S. was not able to assess how much of Russian President Vladimir Putin's military felt this way.  For weeks, Russian forces have been slow to alleviate long-standing logistical challenges, including the resupply of food and fuel to troops on the front.  – Amanda Macias  Russian forces have launched more than 1,100 missiles during the Kremlin's 26-day war in Ukraine, according to a senior U.S. Defense official.  The tempo of missile launches, a mixture of short and medium-range as well as cruise and ballistic, have increased out of frustration over a stalled Russian ground fight.  The official, who asked to remain anonymous to share details of the fighting, said the U.S. is no longer providing a tally of where the missiles are being fired from. In previous weeks, the Pentagon said nearly half were being fired from mobile platforms inside of Ukraine.  The Defense official was unable to confirm reports that Russian forces fired a hypersonic missile into Ukraine and instead added that the use of such a weapon might have been used to stoke fear.  – Amanda Macias  The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it summoned U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan in Moscow to formally protest President Joe Biden's decision last week to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal.""  Sullivan was told that Biden's accusation had put ""Russian-American relations on the verge of rupture,"" according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry translated by NBC News.  Biden said March 16 that he believes Russian leader Vladimir Putin ""is a war criminal"" for his attacks on Ukraine. It was the first time Biden had publicly branded Putin with that phrase.  — Christina Wilkie  Actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have raised more than $34 million in donations for humanitarian aid to Ukraine and temporary housing for Ukrainian refugees, according to the couple's Go Fund Me page.  Kunis was born in Ukraine, and she calls herself ""a proud Ukrainian.""  The money raised is going to the charitable arms of two Silicon Valley startups, housing rental giant Airbnb and shipping broker Flexport. Airbnb is providing free short-term housing to Ukrainian refugees, while Flexport is overseeing relief shipments for refugees.  Top donors to the campaign include billionaire Larry Ellison, tech venture capitalist Yuri Milner and model Karlie Kloss and her husband Josh Kushner.  --- Christina Wilkie  Editor's note: Graphic content. The following post contains images of casualties in Ukraine.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said more than 920 people have died due to the armed conflict in Ukraine.  The UN's tally, which spans from Feb. 24 to March 20, includes 925 deaths and 1,496 injuries. Of those killed, 39 are reported as children.  ""Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,"" the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights wrote in a release.  The international group also ""believes that the actual figures are considerably higher"" but adds that reporting is delayed and difficult to corroborate.   – Amanda Macias  The global Financial Stability Board is closely scrutinizing the use of crypto assets during the war in Ukraine after concerns they could be used to evade Western sanctions on Russia.  Some crypto exchanges have rejected calls to cut off all Russian users, raising concerns that crypto could be used as a way to circumvent sanctions.  Ukraine has also raised millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies after posting appeals on social media for donations in bitcoin and other digital tokens.  The FSB, which groups financial regulators, central banks and finance ministry officials from the Group of 20 economies, is sharing the information it obtains among its members.  – Reuters  President Joe Biden will speak with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson about Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine.  The 11 a.m. ET secure conference call with allies comes ahead of this week's emergency NATO leaders meeting in Brussels, Belgium.  Later in the day, Biden will also consult with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, national security advisor Jake Sullivan, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and CEOs about the U.S. response to Russia's assault on its neighbor, which has gone on for nearly a month.  – Amanda Macias  Maksym Kozytskyi, head of the Lviv Regional State Administration, announced that an Israeli field hospital will be opened in the Lviv region on March 22.  The hospital — which will be in the Yavoriv district of the city of Mostyska — will provide assistance to internally displaced people as well as residents of Mostyska and surrounding communities, Kozytskyi said in a Telegram post.  ""The medical institution will operate in specially equipped tents. Here, Israeli doctors will conduct an initial examination, as well as a separate insulator,"" he said.  ""If a person needs surgery, Israeli specialists will be able to operate on the premises of the community hospital. Three wards [will be] equipped for the inpatient stay of patients in the hospital: men's, women's and children's. Almost 100 people will work in the bridge hospital, more than 60 are doctors.""  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed Israeli lawmakers on Sunday, urging them to impose sanctions on Russia in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.  Israel has condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine, but has not imposed any economic sanctions on Moscow. Under Israeli law, sanctions can only be imposed on a country designated as an enemy state, according to NBC News.  — Chloe Taylor  Vitaliy Bunechko, governor of Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, said in an address posted to Facebook that Zhytomyr had been shelled for the first time since the Russian invasion began.  ""Zhytomyr region was shelled for the first time by Grad missiles,"" a caption accompanying the address said, according to an NBC News translation. ""Three servicemen and one civilian were killed.""  CNBC has not been able to independently verify this information.  In recent weeks, Russian forces have been widening their attacks and targeting cities further into Ukraine's west — away from the Russian border.  On Friday, missiles hit the outskirts of Lviv, a city in western Ukraine which — until the attack — had not been the site of active hostilities. Many Ukrainians fleeing their homes have poured into Lviv as Russia's invasion rages on.  — Chloe Taylor  Images show the destruction of the Retroville shopping mall after a Russian attack on the northwest of Ukraine's capital city Kyiv.  Editors' note: Images contain graphic content.  — Getty Images  Residents of Kyiv have been advised to wear medical respirators outside as the Ukrainian capital prepares for another curfew order to begin.  In a video posted to Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitcshko said the air in the capital had become contaminated in the aftermath of Russian air strikes.  ""Due to fires after air strikes in the capital and the region, air pollution is observed, so do not open the windows,"" he said. ""And when you go outside, protect your lungs by wearing a medical respirator, type FFP2.""  Meanwhile, the Kyiv City State Administration said on Telegram also on Monday that a fresh curfew would come into force in the capital from 8 p.m. local time. The curfew will last until 7 a.m. on Wednesday, authorities said.  Kyiv imposed a 35-hour curfew between Tuesday and Thursday last week.  Ukrainian officials additionally confirmed that eight people had been killed in an air strike on Kyiv's Podil district late on Sunday.  — Chloe Taylor  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that there hasn't been as much progress in talks with Ukraine as Moscow would like.  ""The Russian side demonstrates a much greater willingness to work quickly and meaningfully than the negotiators from the Ukrainian side,"" he claimed.  He said the Kremlin called on other countries to ""use their influence on Kyiv in order to make Kyiv more compliant, more constructive in these negotiations.""  Peskov also said during the briefing that a meeting between Russia and Ukraine's presidents can happen only once negotiations have been completed and any agreements between both sides have been coordinated.  ""No significant progress has been made yet,"" he told reporters. ""To talk about the meeting of the two presidents … they have nothing to agree upon so far. There are no agreements that they can approve.""  — Chloe Taylor  Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko has told CNBC that Russia does not understand compromises, and if Ukraine concedes land to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin will set his sights on the Baltic states.  — Chloe Taylor  An ammonia leak at a chemicals plant in the city of Sumy has been contained, officials have said.  As of 7:49 a.m. local time, the ammonia emissions had been eliminated, Ukraine's Parliament said on the Telegram messaging app.  The update added that employees of the plant were working to restore its technological processes, and that emergency services had completed their work at the site.  The leak was reported at 4:30 a.m. local time, with authorities saying it had been caused by Russian shelling.  — Chloe Taylor  A shelling attack on Kyiv's Podil district on Sunday evening killed eight civilians, Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office has said.  The office said Monday it launched an investigation into the shelling.  ""Large-scale destruction and eight dead,"" the office said in a statement. ""It is established that in the evening of March 20, 2022, the armed forces of the Russian Federation, using the means of warfare prohibited by international law, fired missiles at the Podil district of the capital.""  The Prosecutor General's Office said that as a result of the shelling, which led to a fire, a shopping mall was destroyed and windows in nearby houses and parked cars had been damaged.  ""According to preliminary data, eight people died,"" officials said. ""Information on the dead and injured is being clarified. Rescuers and law enforcement officers are working on the scene to document the crime.""  — Chloe Taylor  Eight humanitarian corridors will be opened in Ukraine on Monday, Ukraine's Commissioner for Human Rights Liudmyla Denisova has said.  Evacuation routes will allow civilians to escape conflict raging in several locations across Ukraine, including the cities of Berdyansk and Mangush, and the villages of Mykilske, Melekine and Kozarovychi.  The corridors will also be used to deliver humanitarian aid to cities under siege.  — Chloe Taylor  Ukraine's armed forces said Russian troops were ""terrorizing"" local populations and looting in occupied cities.  ""The enemy exports home appliances, cars, food and other material resources to the Russian Federation,"" the update said.  Officials also accused Russia of ordering working-age men in the village of Stanychno-Luhansk to go to the local police department for registration on April 1.  ""The reasons for this 'registration' are not explained, although it is connected with the next wave of mobilization to the 2nd Army Corps to be sent to the combat areas,"" Ukrainian officials said.  A spokesperson for the Russian government was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.  — Chloe Taylor  There is an ammonia leak at a chemicals plant in the city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine, according to its regional governor in an update on messaging app Telegram.  The affected area has a radius of about 5km around the plant, said Sumy regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy.  Emergency crews are working on site, but there is no threat to Sumy city at the moment as the wind direction isn't toward the city, the update said. The leak was reported at 4:30 a.m. local time.  — Weizhen Tan  The besieged city of Mariupol has rejected an ultimatum from Russia to surrender by 5 a.m. today, according to Ukrainian authorities.  Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communication said via Facebook early on Monday that Ukraine had rejected the demands from Moscow that Mayor of Mariupol Vadim Boychenko hand over the city by the deadline. It was unclear if the 5 a.m. cut-off was Mariupol time or Moscow time.  Russia had said it would open humanitarian corridors out of the city if Boychenko accepted the ultimatum.  Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's deputy prime minister, told newspaper Pravda in the early hours of Monday morning that Russian authorities had sent an eight-page letter that outlined ""a 'return to history' and other nonsense.""  ""They sent the same letter to the U.N., the International Committee of the Red Cross and hoped that international structures would react and begin to put pressure on Ukraine,"" Vereshchuk said, according to an NBC News translation.  Meanwhile, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA reported overnight that the Russian side would spare the lives of ""all those who laid down their arms,"" citing Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the country's National Center for Defense Control.  ""We call on units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, territorial defense battalions, foreign mercenaries to stop hostilities, lay down their arms and enter the territories controlled by Kyiv along the humanitarian corridors agreed with the Ukrainian side,"" Mizintsev said at a briefing on Sunday, according to RIA.  ""At the same time, all those who laid down their arms are guaranteed a safe exit from Mariupol and the preservation of life.""  Mariupol is a key target in Russia's invasion of Ukraine as its capture could help Moscow create a land corridor to Crimea — a peninsula in the country's south that it invaded and annexed in 2014.  — Chloe Taylor  The Hong Kong-listed shares of Rusal, a Russian aluminum producer, dropped by as much as 8.9% following an announcement by the Australian government that it would ban exports of alumina to Russia.  Several Australian ministries on Sunday jointly announced a ban on exports of alumina and aluminum ores including bauxite to Russia.  The ban is part of Australia's sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.  Last week, Canberra sanctioned two Russian oligarchs who have links to Australia's mining industry, Reuters reported. One was Oleg Deripaska, who holds a stake in Queensland Alumina, a joint venture between Rusal and Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto.  The Sydney-traded shares of Rio Tinto edged higher on Monday.  — Ted Kemp  You can read Sunday's live coverage here:  More than 90% of Ukrainians believe their country will win the war; Zelenskyy warns of WWIII  Russian forces advancing on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv from the north-east have ""stalled,"" according to the UK Defense Ministry's latest intelligence update.  ""Heavy fighting continues north of Kyiv,"" the ministry said, adding that the city ""remains Russia's primary military objective"" despite a continued lack of progress.  ""Forces advancing from the direction of Hostomel to the north-west have been repulsed by fierce Ukrainian resistance.""  The bulk of Russia's forces remain more than 25 kilometers from the center of the city, according to the ministry.  — Eustance Huang "
Russia tells U.S. envoy that relations are 'on the verge of rupture',2022-03-21 17:38:55+00:00,"The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it summoned U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan on Monday in Moscow to formally protest President Joe Biden's decision last week to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal.""  Sullivan was told that Biden's accusation had put ""Russian-American relations on the verge of rupture,"" according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry translated by NBC News.  Biden said Wednesday that he believes Putin ""is a war criminal"" for ordering Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. It was the first time Biden had publicly branded Putin with that phrase.  Biden's comment came hours Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other top officials met virtually with the International Criminal Court's top prosecutor, who two weeks ago opened an investigation into possible war crimes by Russia.  A State Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday from CNBC.  But the U.S. Embassy in Moscow tweeted that Sullivan met with Russian diplomats in order to demand consular access to U.S. citizens detained in Russia, ""including those in pretrial detention.""  American WNBA star player Brittney Griner is currently being held in pretrial detention outside Moscow on allegations of smuggling drugs. The American Embassy did not mention Griner by name in its tweet.  Sullivan is a Trump-era appointee whom the U.S. president asked to stay on at the start of Biden's term in 2021.  The diplomatic breakdown comes as Russia nears the one-month point in its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which was launched Feb. 24.  An initial Russian infantry advance has largely stalled outside of the country's major cities amid fierce Ukrainian resistance. This has forced the Kremlin to shift tactics from a quick land war to a conflict of attrition marked by the shelling of residential areas in an effort to wear down and demoralize the nation.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki later said Biden was speaking from his heart about what he has seen on the news about the ""barbaric actions by a brutal dictator.""  Psaki noted there is a separate legal process to determine whether Putin has violated international law and committed war crimes. That process currently is underway at the State Department, she said.  While the formal process proceeds slowly, top officials in the Biden administration have openly alleged that Putin is a war criminal and that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine.  One day after Biden's comment, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, ""Personally, I agree"" with the president's assessment of Putin.  “Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past three weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,"" said Blinken.

Russian bond yields spike as trading resumes after month-long pause,2022-03-21 14:44:09+00:00,"Some Russian assets returned to trading on Monday after almost a month on the sidelines, with bidding on OFZ government bonds open for limited hours on the Moscow Exchange.  The Central Bank of Russia announced on Friday that trading in federal loan bonds would resume on a discrete auction basis between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. Moscow time on Monday, and in the usual format between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m (10 a.m. and 2 p.m. GMT). Trading in such instruments had been halted for three weeks.  Yields on the benchmark 10-year OFZ ruble treasury bonds spiked to 19.7% in early pre-market trade, an all-time high, but had settled to around 14% by the end of the trading session.  ""For other instruments, trading on the Moscow Exchange will take place in a mode similar to that established on March 18, 2022,"" the central bank added.  The CBR held its key interest rate at 20% last week after more than doubling it in an emergency rate hike in late February, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Bank said Friday that it would begin purchasing OFZ bonds when the Moscow Exchange resumed trading them on Monday, in a bid to mitigate recent volatility in Russian asset markets.  In a separate statement, the CBR added that ""purchases will be made during the time it takes to complete the adjustment of the prices of financial instruments to the new conditions.""  The Russian stock market has been closed since Feb. 25 as stocks plummeted in light of the invasion and subsequent barrage of Western economic sanctions. The CBR has yet to confirm when equity trading can resume, as a backlog of transactions will need to be cleared. However, a number of additional financial market operations will be allowed to resume over the next two weeks.  The Russian ruble was trading at just over 104 to the dollar on Monday afternoon in Europe. "
'Great Resignation' goes global and shakes up labor market for good,2022-03-21 03:14:14+00:00,"Chloe Loh, like many other workers across the world, epitomizes the ""Great Resignation.""  ""I left my job in December,"" Loh told CNBC. ""I was looking for a role that offered more growth. I didn't see that in the role I was in, so I thought I would go look for that elsewhere.""  The term Great Resignation was coined in the United States, describing the tens of millions of Americans who changed jobs or quit working for good during the pandemic.  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data, other developed economies are experiencing similar trends.  There are about 20 million fewer jobs across the OECD's 38 member countries than before the pandemic, while 14 million of these countries' unemployed are not looking for work.   Others, like Chloe, are looking — but holding out for the right opportunity.  ""I was talking with friends about it and they said if you have realized you need to leave, but the right job has just not come up yet – you don't necessarily need to wait for that job to come up to leave. That was a bit of a lightbulb moment for me,"" she said.  So how will the Big Quit change our workforce? Watch the video above to learn more. "

Coal is a 'stupid investment': UN chief Antonio Guterres ,2022-03-21 15:12:06+00:00,"The U.N. Secretary General issued a stark warning Monday, saying the planet had emerged from last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow with ""a certain naïve optimism"" and was ""sleepwalking to climate catastrophe.""  In remarks delivered to The Economist's Sustainability Week via video link, Antonio Guterres sketched out a picture of where he felt the world stood when it came to tackling global warming.  He noted that while COP26 had seen positive developments related to issues such as cutting methane emissions, tackling deforestation and mobilizing private finance, significant challenges remained.  ""Keeping 1.5 alive requires a 45% reduction in global emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by mid-century,"" he said. ""That problem was not solved in Glasgow. In fact, the problem is getting worse.""  Guterres' reference to 1.5 relates to the Paris Agreement's target of limiting global warming ""to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.""  The Paris Agreement was reached at the COP21 climate change summit in December 2015. More than six years on, it would appear that, for Guterres, a huge amount of work still needs to be done.  ""According to present national commitments, global emissions are set to increase by almost 14% in the 2020s,"" he said. ""Last year alone, global energy-related CO2 emissions grew by 6% to their highest levels in history. Coal emissions have surged to record highs. We are sleepwalking to climate catastrophe.""  On Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the wide-ranging effects this could have, Guterres offered up an equally stark assessment. He said that ""the fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine risks upending global food and energy markets, with major implications for the global climate agenda.""  ""As major economies pursue an 'all-of-the-above' strategy to replace Russian fossil fuels, short-term measures might create long-term fossil fuel dependence and close the window to 1.5 degrees.""  ""Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use. And this is madness: addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.""  Guterres' comments come at a time when several major economies, including the European Union, are trying to find ways to reduce their reliance on Russian hydrocarbons.  Last week, the International Energy Agency said speed limits on highways should be cut by at least 10 kilometers per hour (6.2 mph) to help lower oil demand. The recommendation was part of a wider 10-point plan published by the Paris-based organization.

""Their support for coal not only could cost the world its climate goals,"" he said. ""It's a stupid investment — leading to billions in stranded assets."" It was also, he argued, ""time to end fossil fuel subsidies and stop the expansion of oil and gas exploration.""  ""But even the most ambitious action will not erase the fact that the situation is already bad. In many cases, and many places, it is irreversibly bad.""  Coal has a substantial effect on the environment and the U.S. Energy Information Administration lists a range of emissions from coal combustion. These include carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulates and nitrogen oxides. Elsewhere, Greenpeace has described coal as ""the dirtiest, most polluting way of producing energy.""

Morgan Stanley says these hydrogen stocks will win as countries build up their energy infrastructure  Bank of America names top stock picks as Russia-Ukraine conflict hastens Europe’s energy transition  Despite the existence of such goals, fossil fuels still play a huge role in the world's energy mix and companies continue to discover and develop new oil and gas fields.  On the aim of keeping 1.5 alive, Guterres laid out a broad vision for how this could be achieved.  Alongside a ""rapid, just and sustainable energy transition,"" the phase out of coal and all other fossil fuels needed to be sped-up, he said.  Other tools included focusing on adaptation, strengthening national climate plans annually and accelerating the decarbonization of sectors like cement, steel, aviation and shipping.  In addition, the most vulnerable required protection and climate finance needed to be increased. ""That's how we will move the 1.5 degree goal from life support to the recovery room,"" Guterres said.

Thoma Bravo buys Anaplan for $10.7 billion,2022-03-21 13:05:52+00:00,"U.S. private equity giant Thoma Bravo has bought British enterprise software firm Anaplan for $10.7 billion.  The deal, announced Monday, will see Thoma Bravo pay $66 per share in an all-cash transaction.  Anaplan was founded in 2006 in a barn in Yorkshire, England, by Guy Haddleton, Sue Haddleton andMichael Gould.  The financial planning software vendor boasts over 1,900 customers around the world and is viewed as a competitor to the likes of SAP, Oracle and Microsoft.  Frank Calderoni, chairman and CEO of Anaplan, said in a statement that the takeover marks the start of a new chapter for the company.  ""We are confident that Thoma Bravo's resources and insights will help us accelerate and scale our growth strategy,"" he said.  Thoma Bravo has more than $103 billion in assets under management.  The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022 providing there are no objections from regulators or Anaplan's stockholders. Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners are acting as financial advisors.  Prior to listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018 with the ticker ""PLAN,"" Anaplan raised over $240 million in funding from the likes of Amazon- and Tesla-backer Baillie Gifford, as well as Salesforce. It also relocated its headquarters to San Francisco, California.  Over the past 20 years, Thoma Bravo has acquired or invested in more than 375 companies.  Holden Spaht, a managing partner at Thoma Bravo, said in a statement that his firm has followed Anaplan -— which it called a leader in ""connected planning"" — for several years.  Last week it emerged that activist investors had taken a stake in Anaplan.  Keith Meister's Corvex Management and Scott Ferguson's Sachem Head Capital Management teamed up to pursue changes at Anaplan.  According to regulatory filings released on Thursday, Corvex and Sachem Head bought Anaplan shares because they viewed them as undervalued and ""an attractive investment opportunity."" Jonathan Soros, a son of investor George Soros, also joined in the buying spree through JS Capital Management.  The three firms combined own about 9% of Anaplan's outstanding shares, the filings show.  Anaplan's stock peaked in February 2021, and last week it was down around 40% on last year's highs.  On Monday, the company's share price surged over 25% to around $65 a share in pre-market trading.  — Additional reporting by CNBC's Jordan Novet. "
Oligarch Roman Abramovich's $50 million Colorado mansion could become a sanctions target,2022-03-22 12:14:07+00:00,"A Rocky Mountain mansion owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich would likely be among the first assets frozen by the U.S. government if he is sanctioned by the White House in response to the war in Ukraine, according to attorneys and real estate executives.  Among Abramovich's many global real estate trophies is a 14,000-square-foot modern mega-home on 200 acres in Snowmass, Colorado, just outside of Aspen. The Russian billionaire, whose yacht fleet, soccer team and giant homes in London, France and St. Bart's gave him a high profile in the West, bought the property in 2008 for $36.5 million. Local brokers say the property would likely sell for well over $50 million given soaring prices — making it the second most expensive home ever sold in the Aspen area.  ""It's an incredible property, and very rare,"" said Riley Warwick, co-founder of Aspen-based brokerage team Saslove & Warwick at Douglas Elliman Real Estate. ""A lot of my clients have been asking about it.""  Abramovich also owns a 5,500-square-foot chalet-style home in Snowmass Village, which he purchased in 2008 for $11.8 million, according to local property records. The property, just down the road from his bigger home, likely serves as a guest house, caretaker's house or ski house, since it's next to the slopes, local brokers say.  Experts say the properties are prime targets for an asset freeze if Abramovich is sanctioned. Unlike most oligarch-owned real estate in the U.S., the Snowmass properties were both purchased and remain in Abramovich's name, according to local property records. The government can more easily and quickly seize assets that are under the official ownership of a sanctioned individual, since they don't have to go through legal procedures to determine ownership.  Most U.S. real estate owned by Russian billionaires and oligarchs is held through anonymous shell companies or LLCs to hide their true ownership. Many oligarchs also transferred their U.S. properties in recent years to relatives or associates. Oleg Deripaska has transferred his U.S. real estate, including two townhouses in Manhattan and a home in Washington, D.C., to relatives. Abramovich transferred ownership of three Manhattan townhouses to his ex-wife Dasha Zhukova in 2018.  Abramovich has been sanctioned in the U.K. and Canada but not in the European Union or the U.S. The White House is currently weighing whether to include Abramovich in its next round of sanctions, according to people familiar with the discussions.  Abramovich's spokesperson couldn't be reached for comment. A Denver attorney, Brad Schacht, who represented Abramovich in a lawsuit against Comcast Cable stemming from a fiber-optic project on the property, didn't respond to a request for comment.  The threat of a Justice Department seizure has already sparked widespread speculation and intrigue in Aspen, a small town with outsized wealth and super-sized homes. Wal-Mart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke, L Brands founder Leslie Wexner, food-and-beverage magnates Stuart and Linda Resnick own homes there, along with Jeff Bezos' parents and media tycoon Byron Allen. Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell are longtime Aspenites, and the Kardashians, Kate Hudson and Kevin Hart are among the parade of regular Hollywood visitors.  Locals say Abramovich used to have a higher profile in town, hosting a New Year's Eve party in 2008 featuring the Pussycat Dolls. He has also given to local charity, with his name listed prominently as a donor on the side of the Chabad of Aspen. Local property tax records show he was recently billed $68,000 in property taxes for the big house and $29,000 for the smaller property.  Over the past decade, however, Abramovich has stayed out of the local limelight. Local business owners and residents say he rarely if ever visits. The property is ideally suited for privacy, surrounded by 200 acres at the end of a remote, narrow mountain road with only one other home. Abramovich could easily make the 15-minute drive from his private jet and stay in his house without any public scrutiny, locals say.  ""That house is very private and removed,"" real estate broker Warwick said. ""He could easily slip in and out without anyone noticing.""  The home is well known in architectural circles and was designed by New York-based Voorsanger Architects. Perched nearly 1,000 feet above Snowmass Village, it rises like a giant glass wedge along Wildcat Ridge. Its steel folded-plate roof, which looks like a giant wing, was designed for heavy snow loads and cantilevers 40-feet over the driveway.  Inside, the home is clad in sleek black walnut with floor-to-ceiling windows offering dramatic views of Capitol Peak, Mount Daly, the Roaring Fork Valley and Aspen. A 12-foot-tall moss-rock wall divides the east and west wings. Brokers say Abramovich added millions of dollars worth of improvements to the home, including space underground.  If Abramovich is sanctioned, the U.S. Justice Department's new KleptoCapture Task Force would likely be able to freeze the property, but not seize it or take ownership. Sanctions experts say the only way the government can take title is if they can prove Abramovich has committed a U.S. crime.  Meantime, potential wealthy buyers are already circling. Like many ultra-rich towns after the pandemic, Aspen has a shortage of luxury homes for sale, with far more buyers than sellers. Supply of single-family homes in Aspen is down 60% from a year ago, according to Douglas Elliman Real Estate. The average sale price of a home in Aspen is now a record $13 million.  ""A lot of my clients are asking what the status of the home is, and whether it's been frozen,"" Warwick said. ""There has been no information.""  Warwick said brokers hungry for listings have also likely been reaching out to Abramovich to get him to sell.  ""He's not the easiest guy to get a hold of right now,"" he said. ""But I wouldn't be surprised if lots of brokers are trying.""  Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC. "
"Disney CEO Chapek under pressure, at odds with ex-boss Bob Iger",2022-03-20 21:43:28+00:00,"April 12, 2020. That's the day former Disney CEO Bob Iger's relationship with his handpicked successor, current Disney CEO Bob Chapek, began to fall apart.  Iger had stunned the world in February of that year by resigning as Disney's chief executive, effective immediately. He elevated Chapek, whom Iger and the board had long seen internally as the front-runner for the position given his operational experience and decades at the company. Iger would stick around as executive chairman and direct the company's ""creative endeavors"" to help with the transition.  The timing of a CEO change at arguably the world's most famous entertainment company couldn't have been worse. Just weeks after Iger stepped down, Disney began closing its theme parks around the world during the initial stages of the Covid-19 quarantine.  Iger and Chapek seemed to be ready for the pandemic challenge together.  ""I can't think of a better person to succeed me in this role,"" Iger said March 11, 2020, during the company's annual shareholder meeting, a day before the company announced it would begin closing its parks.  Chapek returned the optimism.  The pressure is on Disney CEO Bob Chapek, whose contract is up early next year. Some key takeaways:  ""I've watched Bob [Iger] lead this company to amazing new heights, and I've learned an enormous amount from that experience,"" Chapek said.  One month after those comments, with everyone stuck at home, then-New York Times media columnist Ben Smith published a story after reaching Iger by email. He reported Iger wasn't going to turn Chapek to the wolves as a brand-new CEO while the world was falling apart. Iger told Smith he would stick around to help run the company.  ""A crisis of this magnitude, and its impact on Disney, would necessarily result in my actively helping Bob [Chapek] and the company contend with it, particularly since I ran the company for 15 years!"" Iger said in his email.  Chapek was furious when he saw the story, according to three people familiar with the matter. He had not expressed a need or desire for extra help. He wasn't looking for a white knight. Iger had postponed his retirement as CEO three times already. Chapek felt he was essentially doing it again, leaving him as a hapless second banana, according to people familiar with his thoughts. Chapek was already reporting to Iger, the board's chairman, anyway.  The Disney board had little interest in starting a brawl, especially given the state of the company and the world, the people said. Three days after Smith's story was published, Disney accelerated its timeline and named Chapek to its board.  ""It was a turning-point moment,"" said one of the people familiar with Chapek's reaction to Iger's interview with Smith.  Since that incident, Iger and Chapek haven't been able to mend their relationship, according to about a dozen people familiar with the matter who spoke with CNBC for this story. The people asked to remain anonymous because the relationship and discussions about it are private.  In the months that followed, Chapek began making key decisions about Disney's future — including a dramatic reorganization of the company and outing actress Scarlett Johansson's salary following a dispute over her Marvel movie ""Black Widow"" — without Iger's input. Internal messages about business strategy from both men would sometimes conflict, as it became clear the executives weren't speaking with one voice, several people noted.  While much of the public narrative has centered around Iger's ""long goodbye"" — he departed as chairman in January — Chapek, 61, has actually been firmly in control of Disney for more than 18 months.  Normal times would have allowed Iger and Chapek to work more closely. Instead, the two executives barely spoke to each other. Chapek has a small circle of close confidants with whom he makes major decisions — longtime right-hand man Kareem Daniel, chief of staff Arthur Bochner, and, to some degree, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy, whom Iger promoted to the role in 2015, according to people familiar with the matter.  Iger hasn't been part of that circle.  Late last year, just weeks before his departure as executive chairman, Iger threw himself a going-away party, inviting more than 50 people at his house in Brentwood, a suburban Los Angeles neighborhood. He spoke at length about his time at Disney in front of the crowd. Chapek attended, but there was little interaction between the two men, according to people who attended the party. Guests — including veteran Disney executives and on-camera talent, such as broadcasters Robin Roberts, David Muir and Al Michaels — sat at two long tables at Iger's house.  Iger and Chapek sat at opposite tables. Chapek sat near several of his direct reports, including Daniel. Iger sat next to film director and mogul Steven Spielberg. While Iger spent about 10 minutes publicly praising former colleagues, he barely mentioned Chapek, said the people.  ""It was extremely awkward,"" said one of the guests, who asked to remain anonymous because the party was private. ""The tension was palpable.""  Both Iger and Chapek declined to comment on their relationship with each other.  Chapek's decision to move away from Iger showed chutzpah, but it also put him on an island against a Disney icon, who also happened to be the chairman of his company and a large shareholder. He also hasn't been able to benefit from the myriad relationships Iger developed from decades at Disney.  Anyone succeeding Iger, who had been Disney's CEO since 2005, was going to have a difficult time filling his shoes. Iger was generally beloved by Hollywood and highly respected as a CEO, particularly after orchestrating a series of intellectual property acquisitions — of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm — which will likely go down in media history as three of the smartest deals ever. Iger, 71, has even flirted with running for president of the United States.  Chapek, meanwhile, has a harder exterior and at times, according to colleagues, struggles with emotional intelligence — which happens to be Iger's strength.  The differences between the executives' leadership styles have come to light quickly in Chapek's tenure.  Disney's public spat last year with Johansson over compensation after ""Black Widow"" streamed on Disney+ at the same time it hit theaters during the pandemic embarrassed Iger, who prided himself on smooth relationships with A-list talent. While the controversy happened under Chapek's watch as CEO, Iger was still chairman and working with creative talent.  This month, Chapek's public acknowledgement that he let Disney employees down by not fighting harder against Florida's ""Don't Say Gay"" legislation has been another reminder to Iger loyalists that Disney's brand may be at risk with Chapek at the helm. Weeks before, Iger took a public stance against the legislation.  The messy execution has angered Disney employees. Deadline reported it spoke with several longtime Disney employees who said Chapek's handling of the situation led to ""the worst week they've ever had working at the company."" Several Disney employees have called Iger in recent weeks to express their disappointment in Chapek, according to two people familiar with the matter. Chapek met with creative leaders at Disney earlier this month to hear their concerns about his response to the bill, CNBC previously reported.  Perhaps the biggest division between Chapek and Iger was a more mundane one — Chapek's decision to remove so-called profit-and-loss, or P&L, power from many of Disney's veteran division leaders and consolidate all of that control under Daniel.  While public controversies generate headlines, it's likely to be Chapek's internal changes, and how successful they become, that will determine his future as Disney's CEO.  In October 2020, about eight months after he took over as CEO, Chapek announced Disney was strategically reorganizing its media and entertainment businesses. This was Disney's second major reorganization in less than three years. The key part of the announcement was the following:  ""The new Media and Entertainment Distribution group will be responsible for all monetization of content —both distribution and ad sales — and will oversee operations of the Company's streaming services. It will also have sole P&L accountability for Disney's media and entertainment businesses.""  Those two sentences upended how Disney has done business for decades. The change gave Daniel, the leader of the new Media and Entertainment Distribution group, called DMED internally, one of the most important jobs in the history of media. The decision was instantly polarizing, leading to a burst of internal frustration among some veteran Disney employees who no longer controlled the budgets of their divisions, according to people familiar with the matter.  Chapek wants to streamline Disney so content decisions across distribution platforms can be made in synchrony. Instead of division heads running their own fiefdoms, Chapek and Daniel can steer Disney by controlling the budgets of each group and deciding where content ends up — streaming or cable or broadcast or movie theaters. Executives can then focus on making content, or selling ads, or building streaming technology, with direction from Chapek and Daniel. Historically, the heads of Disney TV or ESPN or Hulu or film would run their entire businesses.  Conceptually, Chapek's idea actually isn't all that different from what Iger had begun to put in place with the organization of Disney+. In early 2018, Iger met with Robert Kyncl, chief business officer at Google's YouTube, according to people familiar with the meeting. Before Google, Kyncl had worked for seven years at Netflix, overseeing content partnerships.  Kyncl told Iger if he wanted Disney to start trading at Netflix-like multiples — which were, at the time, orders of magnitude higher than Disney's — Iger needed to run operations like a technology company. Google separated its content and distribution divisions. The same roles didn't live within smaller groups, the way Disney had been structured for years.  Kyncl declined to comment to CNBC about the meeting.  If Disney wanted investors to see its burgeoning streaming service as the growth engine in a digital-first world, Iger realized he needed to centralize power around Disney+. According to two people familiar with the meeting, Iger urgently asked then-Disney head of strategy Kevin Mayer to return from the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas so Iger could show him a new organizational structure, which he drew on a whiteboard in front of Mayer. Mayer would become the head of Disney's new direct-to-consumer unit, in charge of the company's streaming platforms: Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Disney officially reorganized in March 2018.  Power struggles followed. Mayer and Disney TV studio head Peter Rice fought about who had the authority to decide which shows aired on Disney+. Rice's principal issue was that content executives could no longer have direct conversations with Hollywood talent and tell them whether Disney would make their show or not. Rice feared losing greenlight power would affect Disney's relationship with Hollywood. If studio executives didn't have the power to approve projects, they'd quickly lose credibility with creators, who would want to speak with the people at Disney who possessed that authority.  Iger had to solve the disputes by making control decisions on the fly. Mayer won the main argument — he would have greenlight power for Disney+. Mayer left Disney in 2020 to become TikTok's CEO, months after Iger chose Chapek as CEO.  Mayer and Rice declined to comment for this story.  While Chapek didn't consult Iger about his October 2020 reorganization, he did cite many of the same principles that Kyncl and Iger discussed in 2018.  ""Managing content creation distinct from distribution will allow us to be more effective and nimble in making the content consumers want most, delivered in the way they prefer to consume it,"" Chapek said in a statement announcing the changes.  When he became CEO, Chapek went on a listening tour of executives to find out what was working and what wasn't. He heard from both distribution and content executives that the current arrangement had become dysfunctional.  Chapek decided to reverse Iger's decision to have greenlighting authority rest with the head of the streaming services. He gave that power back to content heads, who have more money than ever before to make programming — Disney plans to spend a record $33 billion on content for fiscal 2022. That's largely pleased Disney's content leaders, who can now tell creators directly whether Disney will work with them, according to people familiar with the matter.  But with Daniel getting P&L control, long-term Disney executives also lost the ability to run the businesses of their own divisions. Some creative leaders didn't mind, preferring to focus on making content rather than selling advertising or working on wholesale distribution agreements with pay-TV providers. Others didn't appreciate their loss of control over budgets.  Kelly Campbell's decision to leave her job running Hulu to lead NBCUniversal's Peacock in October was at least partially motivated by her desire to have more control over a business than what Disney allowed her, according to a person familiar with her thinking.  Campbell declined to comment for this story.  One film executive told CNBC that Disney operated smoothly when Alan Bergman, chairman of Disney Studios, and Alan Horn, former chief creative officer of Disney Studios, were in charge of the studio's P&L. Film producers knew standard facts, such as a movie's marketing budget or a film's release date. In the new world, with Daniel in charge, it's much harder to find out answers because the creative point people simply don't know, the person said.  Others saw Chapek's restructuring as simply pushing the envelope on a trend Iger already started —making it clear to Wall Street that streaming was the company's new priority. By putting Daniel in charge of a variety of different budgets, Chapek could more easily steer all of Disney in the same direction. Decisions could be made more quickly.  This month, Disney put its new Pixar movie ""Turning Red"" directly on Disney+ instead of in theaters first. That decision would have taken ""months"" under Iger's structure, with division heads flexing their power and knowledge of the market, according to three people who participated in the discussions. Instead, the debate took weeks, with Pixar executives ultimately agreeing that the movie should go to Disney+ first, the people said. ""Turning Red"" is the No. 1 film premiere on Disney+ globally to date, based on number of hours watched in the first three days.  As with any corporate reorganization, the proof will be in the results. Disney has a target of 230 million to 260 million global Disney+ subscribers by the end of 2024, compared with about 130 million Disney+ subscribers today. If Disney can get there, Chapek and Daniel can claim success — assuming they also revive the company's shares, which have fallen about 30% in the past 52 weeks, even as crowds have returned to Disney's theme parks around the world.  Daniel's P&L oversight for all movie, TV and film distribution, advertising, sales, technology and other divisions — jobs that used to be done by a cadre of Disney employees with 20 or 30 years experience each — gives him one of the most powerful jobs ever created in media. Disney's fiscal 2021 revenue topped $67 billion and has a market capitalization of about $240 billion. Disney routinely outspends all other global companies by billions of dollars a year on entertainment content.  Iger never agreed with giving Daniel so much control. The former CEO felt stripping division heads of their budget control wasn't the right structure for Disney because the company was too diverse and complex.  Daniel is a polarizing figure among colleagues who have worked with him.  He's described by five former and current co-workers as smart, hard-working and gregarious. He studied electrical engineering and got an MBA from Stanford. He'll slap people's backs and is fun to engage with outside of work, three of the people said. He's demanding of his direct reports and holds them accountable, the people said.  Daniel is Black, an extreme rarity among the primary leaders of global media companies. He's the first Black senior executive ever to report directly to the Disney CEO in the history of the company. That carries weight with certain employees, who respect the symbolism of a minority leader in such a high-profile role.  Like Chapek, Daniel has worked in a variety of Disney units, including studio distribution, consumer products, games and publishing, Walt Disney Imagineering, and corporate strategy. He's been close to Chapek for two decades, first working for him as an MBA intern in 2002. When Daniel moved to corporate strategy, he again worked with Chapek on a variety of projects in 2007 and 2008. He worked under Chapek in distribution for Walt Disney Studios in 2009, when he was part of the M&A team that bought Marvel Entertainment, before following him to consumer products in 2011.  Chapek was particularly impressed with Daniel's consumer focus when the two worked together to shorten the theatrical window from four months to three months at the end of 2009, according to a person familiar with the matter.  But some of the same people who note Daniel's strengths also told CNBC the job may be too big for him — or almost anyone.  ""He arguably has the most important job at Walt Disney, outside of CEO, and he has almost no experience running any of these businesses that were previously run by people that had decades of experience,"" said one former coworker.  Chapek disagrees with that assessment, according to a person familiar with his thinking. He understands the job is massive in scope but feels that Daniel is suited to handle it given his varied experiences at Disney, including as president of consumer products, games and publishing, and president of operations at Walt Disney Imagineering.  Since his promotion announcement in October 2020, Daniel hasn't done any published or televised interviews. He declined to comment for this story.  Ideally, Chapek would like consumers to experience a more unified digital Disney experience, whether it's logging into Disney+ or buying merchandise from the online Disney store or managing theme park experiences with Disney's Genie service, which is a kind of digital concierge. Internally, some employees informally speak of this grand challenge of unifying Disney technology and experiences as ""One Disney.""  Chapek and Daniel want to hasten the pace of Disney's digital transformation. In January, Chapek established company goals to ""set the stage for our second century, and ensure Disney's next 100 years are as successful as our first."" Two of the main themes were breaking down silos and innovation.  Disney, by nature and history, isn't a technology company, even though it's trying to restructure itself to be like one. In general, its employees don't have the same type of technological know-how that you'd find at Apple and Google.  That's problematic for a company that wants to trade at a technology-like multiple. According to a person familiar with the matter, Disney has struggled to build back-end technology to sell advertising on all of its streaming services — Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ — and traditional distribution channels. Disney+ and ESPN+ run on streaming infrastructure from BAMTech, a spin-off of MLB Advanced Media that Disney bought in 2017. Hulu has its own separate infrastructure.  Chapek and Daniel are still trying to streamline the organizational structure. Disney hires people dedicated to marketing or selling ads for its streaming services, ESPN, ABC and Disney's entertainment cable networks, including some from its acquisition of 21st Century Fox. Those jobs can be duplicative and work against a ""One Disney"" experience.  Chapek has several times mentioned Disney building its own metaverse, although he hasn't gone into detail about what exactly that means. Last month, Chapek promoted veteran executive Mike White to be Disney's senior vice president in charge of ""next generation storytelling."" In a memo seen by CNBC last month, Chapek said White's goal will be ""connecting the physical and digital worlds"" around Disney entertainment.  Chapek will also have to decide what to do with Disney's current assets. Some media analysts, such as LightShed's Rich Greenfield, have argued Disney would be best off spinning out ESPN and combining it with a digital sportsbook. But that hasn't been Chapek's priority. ESPN relies on traditional TV affiliate fees, and it may not be strategically aligned with Disney's direct-to-consumer ambitions, but the company has no plans to spin off or sell the sports network, said people familiar with the matter. ESPN has considered licensing its name to sports betting companies, but Disney isn't interested in buying one, the people said.  Chapek will need time to show his own employees and shareholders that he can be trusted to accomplish goals he lays out. Nearly everyone interviewed for this story said that while Chapek may not be a ""people person,"" he's a skilled and determined operator. Disney's fiscal first-quarter results blew away analyst estimates on earnings per share, revenue and total Disney+ subscribers.  Several current Disney executives noted that Chapek's No. 1 priority — setting up Disney for a digital world where streaming dominates and legacy distribution models fade away — is exactly what Iger believed in. That adds an element of sorrow to the men's failed relationship. Their end goals are the same.  It's possible Disney employees and the broader media and entertainment world simply get used to Chapek's method of leadership with time. Chapek clearly isn't Iger, but perhaps his biggest challenge will be convincing everyone it's OK not to be.  Chapek's contract is up at the end of February 2023.  Iger regrets how the change of control has transpired, one person said. But he's also not returning to Disney, he told Kara Swisher in a January interview.  ""I was CEO for a long time,"" Iger said. ""You can't go home again. I'm gone.""  Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.  WATCH: Disney CEO Bob Chapek addresses Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' bill "
"Russia-Ukraine war: oil prices jump, IEA calls for cut in energy usage",2022-03-21 05:58:14+00:00,"Oil prices jumped even higher on Monday after Russia-Ukraine talks appeared to yield no sign of progress, and markets continued to fret over tight supply — sparking a call by the International Energy Agency to reduce oil demand.  Crude futures were up more than 3% on Monday morning during Asia trading — international benchmark Brent crude was at  $111.46, and U.S. futures at $108.25.  Oil prices have been volatile in recent weeks – soaring to record highs in March before tumbling more than 20% last week to touch below $100. They jumped again in the latter half of last week to rise above that level.  In a note on Monday, Mizuho Bank said two factors were pushing oil prices higher: lingering Russia-Ukraine uncertainty as well as hopes that China's latest Covid impact could be less dire than anticipated amid expectations of easing restrictions. The key hub of Shenzhen partially opened up Friday, as five districts were allowed to restart work and resume public transportation, Reuters reported.  Ukrainian and Russian officials have met intermittently for peace talks, which have so far failed to progress to key concessions. Still, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy has called for another round of talks with Moscow.  ""If these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third world war,"" Zelenskyy told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an interview that aired Sunday morning.  ""The breakdown of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine saw crude oil prices extend their rebound on Friday,"" ANZ Research analysts Brian Martin and Daniel Hynes wrote in a Monday note. ""However, it failed to offset the losses earlier in the week, with Brent crude ending down more than 4%.""  Meanwhile, tight supply continued to worry markets, sparking a call by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday for ""emergency measures"" to reduce oil usage.  The Russia-Ukraine war has led to worries over supply disruptions as a result of U.S. sanctions on Russian oil and gas. The U.K. and European Union also said they would phase out Russian fossil fuels. Russia supplied 11% of global oil consumption and 17% of global gas consumption in 2021, and as much as 40% of Western European gas consumption in the same period, according to statistics from Goldman Sachs.  European Union governments are set to meet U.S. President Joe Biden this week as the EU considers an oil embargo on Russia over the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  The Commonwealth Bank of Australia warned Monday that oil prices have fallen below recent peaks because markets are still largely pricing oil by ""assessing the likelihood of a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict.""  ""Physical shortages, linked to current sanctions on Russia, though will eventually play a more dominant role in oil price determination,"" said Vivek Dhar, the bank's director of energy commodities research, in a note.  ""The industry's apparent inability to fill any potential gap has seen calls for consumption to be reduced,"" the ANZ Research analysts said.  Morgan Stanley says these hydrogen stocks will win as countries build up their energy infrastructure  Bank of America names top stock picks as Russia-Ukraine conflict hastens Europe’s energy transition  OPEC+ in its latest report showed some producers are still falling short of their supply quotas, with Reuters citing sources who said that the alliance missed its targets by more than 1 million barrels a day.  In a 10-point plan, the IEA's suggestions to reduce oil demand included reducing speed limits for vehicles, working from home for up to three days a week, and avoiding air travel for business.  ""We estimate that the full implementation of these measures in advanced economies alone can cut oil demand by 2.7 million barrels a day within the next four months, relative to current levels,"" the IEA said Friday.

Berkshire to buy insurer Alleghany for $11.6 billion in Warren Buffett's biggest deal in years,2022-03-21 20:11:56+00:00,"Warren Buffett just announced his biggest deal since 2016.  Berkshire Hathaway said Monday morning it agreed to buy insurance company Alleghany for $11.6 billion, or $848.02 per share, in cash. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate said the deal ""represents a multiple of 1.26 times Alleghany's book value at December 31, 2021,"" as well as a 16% premium to Alleghany's average stock price in the past 30 days. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.  This transaction would mark Berkshire's biggest acquisition in six years when the conglomerate bought industrial company Precision Castparts for $37 billion, including debt.  Through its subsidiaries, New York-based Alleghany is involved in a number of different insurance businesses, including wholesale specialty, property and casualty, and reinsurance. Alleghany is also a conglomerate just like Berkshire, owning a steel company, a toy maker and funeral services firm, along with its primary insurance business.  ""Berkshire will be the perfect permanent home for Alleghany, a company that I have closely observed for 60 years,"" Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and CEO, said in a statement.  Insurance is one of Berkshire's bread-and-butter businesses as it already owns Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance and others that have been driving growth in recent years.  Alleghany CEO Joseph Brandon — who previously led General Re — hailed the deal as a ""terrific transaction for Alleghany's owners, businesses, customers, and employees,"" noting that ""the value of this transaction reflects the quality of our franchises and is the product of the hard work, persistence, and determination of the Alleghany team over decades.""  Alleghany and its units will operate independently after the deal closes.  The deal may surprise some Berkshire shareholders, as Buffett and his right-hand man — Vice Chairman Charlie Munger — have expressed frustration in their search for a big acquisition. In his 2022 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett said he and Munger found little that ""excites"" them in terms of large deals.  ""Throughout 85 years the Kirby family has created a business that has many similarities to Berkshire Hathaway,"" Buffett said. Jefferson W. Kirby is chair of the Alleghany board of directors.  Alleghany started out in 1929 as a holding company for railroads and eventually pivoted to insurance, which has parallels to Berkshire's roots as a textile manufacturing company more than a century ago before it became a multifaceted conglomerate.  To be sure, $11.6 billion is a small number when compared with Berkshire's massive cash hoard of $146.72 billion at the end of 2021.  ""For Berkshire, the transaction increases its presence in the specialty insurance and reinsurance segments at a time when market conditions remain attractive for growth,"" said Cathy Seifert, a Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research.  Shares of Alleghany jumped nearly 25% on Monday. Berkshire's Class A shares rose more than 2% to hit an all-time high after closing above $500,000 for the first time last week.  Alleghany is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Willkie Farr & Gallagher through the transaction's completion. "
Nickel price falls 15% to hit new limit down on London Metal Exchange,2022-03-21 11:51:25+00:00,"LONDON — Nickel prices resumed their freefall on Monday, with the benchmark three-month contract falling 15% to hit another new trading limit.  The price hit $31,380 a metric ton as it opened for trade on the London Metal Exchange, according to Refinitiv data.  The 145-year-old exchange, which still has some open outcry trading, has had a wild couple of weeks of nickel trading, with price surges, technical glitches and trading suspensions.  Commodity prices jumped earlier this month on supply fears related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with a barrage of Western sanctions raising disruption fears. Russia is a key producer and exporter of metals and grains and is the world's third-largest producer of nickel — a key ingredient in stainless steel and a component in lithium-ion batteries.  On March 8, nickel prices more than doubled in a matter of hours. The price climbed above $100,000 a metric ton as China's Tsingshan Holding Group, one of the world's top producers, bought large amounts to reduce its short bets on the metal.  Trading was halted on the LME as the move added to a significant price rally. On Wednesday last week, the LME attempted to resume nickel trading after the rare shut down. However, a ""systems error"" allowed a small number of trades to go through below a newly imposed 5% daily price limit, and the exchange was temporarily halted once again.  The LME then installed a trading range of 8% for Thursday and 12% for Friday. Both sessions saw the price immediately hit its lower limit when trading began. Reuters reported Friday that volumes were low and few buyers were willing to pay the LME price, which was above that on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Speaking before the open on Wednesday, Matthew Chamberlain, CEO of the LME, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" that the exchange was ""absolutely mindful of the impact that this has had on so many people and we need to make sure that it doesn't happen again.""  Chamberlain said the LME had ""deliberately prioritized stability"" by setting a relatively narrow range of daily trading limits, but these could soon be widened if the exchange observed a ""more orderly market.""  —CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this article.

"China sticks to zero Covid, managing outbreak one local city at a time",2022-03-21 06:26:59+00:00,"BEIJING — As some parts of China reopen, others are imposing new Covid-related restrictions, reflecting the challenge government officials face in controlling the worst outbreak since early 2020.  Chinese authorities are trying to maintain their zero-Covid strategy that used swift lockdowns to help the economy grow in 2020. Beijing has increasingly emphasized how the strategy needs to be ""dynamic.""  But local officials now face multiple challenges at once: Keeping their jobs whose performance hinges on controlling Covid outbreaks, limiting the spread of a highly transmissible variant and supporting enough growth to achieve the national GDP target of around 5.5% set by Beijing.  ""Officials at all levels must give top priority to epidemic response,"" according to a readout Friday of a top-level government meeting chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping.  ""Anyone who fails to perform their duties and responsibilities and thus leads to a drastic escalation will be investigated and held to account right away in accordance with discipline and regulations,"" the readout said.  Dozens of local Chinese officials have lost their jobs or received punishments after failing to prevent the latest spike of cases.  Mainland China's new daily Covid cases remained well above 1,000 over the weekend, with hundreds of asymptomatic ones.  The northern province of Jilin reported Friday the first two deaths in the latest Covid wave, which stems primarily from the highly transmissible omicron variant. The number of new cases and deaths is still low compared with other major countries.  On the economic front, regions are affected by business disruptions and uncertainty, even if stricter Covid controls don't necessarily halt production outright.  China's steel-making hub of Tangshan city ordered that as of Sunday, all non-emergency vehicles are banned from local roads, except for those that obtain special approval. Several districts ordered residents to stay home and told businesses such as gyms to close.  There was no specific order for steel mills. But Chinese financial news outlet Cailian reported, citing locals, that Tangshan's steel trade and logistics businesses had stopped work, while some producers had retained a few workers for basic production.  Tangshan reported nine confirmed Covid cases this weekend.  In southern China, the tech and manufacturing city of Shenzhen has kept ports open despite orders last week to halt other business activity and factory production.  Shipping giant Maersk said late last week Covid testing requirements for truck drivers and stricter road control between Shenzhen and nearby cities means trucking services in the area will likely ""be severely impacted by 40%."" That's up from the company's assessment a few days earlier of a 30% impact.  ""Consequently, there will be longer delivery time and a possible rise in transport costs such as detour fee and highway fee,"" Maersk said.  Shenzhen reported 82 new cases over the weekend — relatively high for China. However, municipal authorities declared Sunday that the outbreak was ""controllable."" They announced the city would resume ""normal"" operations and production Monday, including public transportation.  It's less clear how normal life can be in practice. The city said anyone taking public transit must show a negative virus test taken within the last 48 hours.  Some neighborhoods remain under lockdown, and non-essential businesses are to remain shut, the city said. Authorities told parents to help their children with online learning — without making it clear whether businesses would allow employees to work from home.  Morgan Stanley says these Chinese stocks could rebound — Alibaba, Tencent aren't on the list  Wall Street banks name their favorite Asia stocks — and Citi says one could have upside of 167%  Xpeng and more: Morgan Stanley says these stocks will benefit from rising oil prices  Similarly, in a southern manufacturing center of Dongguan, local authorities emphasized the need for ""targeted"" Covid control measures, including ""one policy per business"" or factory.  Dongguan's city-wide lockdown measures announced last Tuesday are set to expire at the end of Monday, although public transit resumed operations on Friday.  The city reported a total of two new confirmed Covid cases over the weekend.  Shanghai has taken one of the most targeted lockdown policies in China, as authorities seek to balance economic growth with Covid control. The city reported 41 new confirmed cases for the weekend.  However, the outbreak is still taking its toll on big businesses. Shanghai Disney Resort announced it would be closed from Monday until further notice due to the pandemic. "
German firms sign deals in UAE,2022-03-21 12:43:28+00:00,"German companies have signed agreements with firms in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to build up a hydrogen supply chain, Germany's economy ministry said on Monday, as Berlin looks to cut carbon emissions and reduce its reliance on Russian energy.  The deals were signed during a visit by German Economy Minister Robert Habeck to Gulf states to discuss long-term energy supplies. Berlin is investing in cleaner energy and aiming to cut its reliance on Russian energy as part of Western efforts to put pressure on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.  Germany's Hydrogenious and Uniper, along with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Japan's JERA, will undertake a joint demonstration project for hydrogen transport, the ministry said in a statement.  The agreement aims to build a supply chain of hydrogen produced by renewable energy from the UAE to Wilhelmshaven in Germany, based on Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) technology.  ADNOC also signed contracts with German copper manufacturer Aurubis and energy firms RWE, Steag and GEWEC to ship so-called blue ammonia —a low carbon method of producing the compound — to Germany.  Hamburger Hafen & Logistik AG (HHLA) and ADNOC will cooperate to transport the blue ammonia.  The CEO of Thyssenkrupp, which hopes to list its hydrogen unit Nucera on the stock market this year, accompanied Habeck on the trip.  Additionally, German research organization the Fraunhofer Society and the Emirati ministry of energy and infrastructure agreed to deepen the exchange of expertise in sustainable energy and applied hydrogen technology.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, which rose more than 1% in early trade, erased gains and closed 0.89% lower at 21,221.34. The city's benchmark index finished more than 4% higher last week following a volatile week which swung between big gains and losses.  Trading in the Hong Kong-listed shares of China Evergrande and its property services and new energy vehicle unit was halted on Monday, according to exchange notices. Evergrande said the trading halt was related to the pending release of an announcement containing inside information.  Meanwhile, Hong Kong-listed shares of Russia's Rusal dropped 5.4%. The firm said Monday it was evaluating the impact of a ban announced Sunday by the Australian government on exports of alumina and aluminum ores to Russia.  Mainland Chinese stocks, on the other hand, closed in positive territory. The Shanghai composite rose fractionally to 3,253.69 and the Shenzhen component advanced 0.414% to 12,379.64.  China's one-year loan prime rate was kept unchanged at 3.7% on Monday, largely in line with expectations from a Reuters survey.  Investors have been watching for hints of policy support from Beijing following a Chinese state media report last week that signaled support for Chinese stocks.  UBS Global Wealth Management's Eva Lee said policy easing measures by Chinese authorities — including one to two rounds of cuts in the reserve requirement ratio for banks — are expected ahead. She added the earliest of any actions may be in early April, based on past practices.

The price of oil has been volatile since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, rising rapidly to highs not seen in 13 years before falling sharply. As of Monday afternoon Singapore time, Brent is up more than 40% for the year.  ""Oil is high right now but ... if you look at what happened with Crimea in 2014 after the Russians invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea initially oil prices were more than $100 a barrel but they eventually came down,"" Vasu Menon, executive director of investment strategy at OCBC Bank, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday.  ""We don't think prices will go back down to $20, $30 a barrel but ... they could ease back below the $100 mark in the coming months,"" he said.

Hong Kong plans to scrap flight ban on 9 countries on April 1,2022-03-21 04:56:39+00:00,"Hong Kong plans to relax some anti-Covid measures next month. That includes lifting a ban on flights from nine countries, reducing quarantine time for arrivals from abroad and reopening schools.The moves, announced on Monday by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, could quieten some criticism from residents who have become increasingly frustrated with the city's stringent measures, some of which have been in place for over two years.The flight ban would be lifted from April 1, while hotel quarantine for arrivals could be cut to seven days from 14 if residents tested negative, Lam told a news briefing. She had previously said measures would be in place until April 20.  Schools would resume face-to-face classes from April 19, after the Easter holidays, while public venues including sports facilities would also reopen from April 21, she said.  Hong Kong's border has effectively been shut since 2020, with very few flights able to land and hardly any passengers allowed to transit, effectively isolating a city that had built a reputation as a global financial hub.  The ban had made it very difficult for residents to return to the Chinese-ruled territory, with many spending time known as ""washing out"" in other countries for two weeks before being allowed to return.  The rules, together with constant mixed messaging from the government, including over whether a citywide lockdown and mass testing would take place, have triggered an exodus of residents in the past two months.  Net outflows show more than 54,000 people have left Hong Kong so far in March, compared with more than 71,000 in February and nearly 17,000 in December before the fifth wave of the pandemic hit, prompting fears for the city's longer-term competitiveness.  Businesses and the city's economy are reeling from widespread closures, while doctors say many of the city's 7.4 million residents are grappling with rising mental health issues, particularly among low-income families.  A plan to carry out mass coronavirus testing would be put on hold, Lam said, citing experts who said it was not a suitable time.  While the former British colony has officially stuck to the ""dynamic zero"" coronavirus policy, similar to mainland China, which seeks to curb all outbreaks, it has been shifting to mitigation strategies as deaths skyrocketed.  Hong Kong has registered the most deaths per million people globally in recent weeks — more than 24 times that of rival Singapore — owing to a large proportion of elderly people who were unvaccinated as the highly transmissible omicron variant ripped through care homes since February.The densely packed city has recorded more than 1 million infections since the pandemic started and about 5,000 deaths — most of them in the past month.  As many as 4 million people could be infected, according to estimates from health experts, as many residents have contracted the virus and isolated at home without notifying authorities.   "
Health experts predict uptick in U.S. Covid cases due to new BA.2 variant,2022-03-20 19:25:13+00:00,"U.S. health experts are warning an emerging, highly contagious Covid omicron variant, called BA.2, could soon lead to another uptick in domestic coronavirus cases.  White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said BA.2 is about 50% to 60% more transmissible than omicron, but it does not appear to be more severe. Health officials continue to stress coronavirus vaccines and boosters remain the best ways to prevent serious illness from the virus.  ""It does have increased transmission capability,"" Fauci said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""However, when you look at the cases, they do not appear to be any more severe and they do not appear to evade immune responses either from vaccines or prior infections.""  The variant has already caused cases to increase in China and parts of Europe. It is estimated to account for about 25% or 30% of new cases in the U.S., but it could become the country's most dominant variant, Fauci said.  Fauci said he expects ""an uptick in cases"" due to BA.2, but not necessarily a massive surge like other variants have caused. That's despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently relaxing mask recommendations for most Americans.  U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a board member of Covid vaccine maker Pfizer and a former head of the Food and Drug Administration, also expressed similar views on Sunday regarding BA.2.  Murthy said the variant could cause a new spike in cases but that the country is in a better position now than it was in the previous two years, when Covid-19 ""defined our lives.""  ""We should be prepared, Covid hasn't gone away,"" Murthy said during ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Our focus should be on preparation, not on panic.""  Gottlieb, echoing previous comments days before to CNBC, said he also expects ""some uptick"" due to BA.2 but ""not a big wave of infection.""  ""I think we're going to continue to see low levels of infection through the summer. But before we get there, we're probably going to see some tick-up of infection like the Europeans are seeing right now, maybe not as pronounced,"" Gottlieb said Sunday during CBS's ""Face the Nation.""  The CDC reported more than 31,200 new Covid-19 cases Saturday, including 958 deaths. Both are significantly down from the beginning of the year.  Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer, genetic testing start-up Tempus, health-care tech company Aetion and biotech company Illumina. He also serves as co-chair of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' and Royal Caribbean's ""Healthy Sail Panel."" "
Shanghai Disney to close starting Monday amid Covid outbreak in China,2022-03-20 17:00:25+00:00,"The Shanghai Disney Resort said on Sunday it will temporarily close until further notice starting Monday, citing the new coronavirus outbreak in China.  ""Due to the current pandemic situation, Shanghai Disney Resort, including Shanghai Disneyland, Disneytown and Wishing Star Park will be temporarily closed from Monday, March 21, 2022,"" it said in a statement.  ""We will continue to monitor the pandemic situation and consult local authorities, and will notify guests as soon as we have a confirmed date to resume operations,"" it added.  China is fighting its biggest wave of locally transmitted Covid cases since it contained the initial outbreak centered on Wuhan in 2020. Shanghai has shut schools and launched a city-wide testing program that has seen dozens of residential compounds sealed off for at least 48 hours.  On Sunday, mainland China reported 1,656 new locally transmitted cases for March 19. "
Biden administration rules Myanmar army committed genocide against Rohingya,2022-03-20 19:44:40+00:00,"The Biden administration has formally determined that violence committed against the Rohingya minority by Myanmar's military amounts to genocide and crimes against humanity, U.S. officials told Reuters, a move that advocates say should bolster efforts to hold the junta that now runs Myanmar accountable.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken will announce the decision on Monday at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. U.S. officials said, which currently features an exhibit on the plight of the Rohingya. It comes nearly 14 months after he took office and pledged to conduct a new review of the violence.  Myanmar's armed forces launched a military operation in 2017 that forced at least 730,000 of the mainly Muslim Rohingya from their homes and into neighboring Bangladesh, where they recounted killings, mass rape and arson. In 2021, Myanmar's military seized power in a coup.  U.S. officials and an outside law firm gathered evidence in an effort to acknowledge quickly the seriousness of the atrocities, but then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to make a determination.  Blinken ordered his own ""legal and factual analysis,"" the U.S. officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The analysis concluded the Myanmar army is committing genocide and Washington believes the formal determination will increase international pressure to hold the junta accountable.  ""It's going to make it harder for them to commit further abuses,"" said one senior State Department official.  Officials in Myanmar's embassy in Washington and a junta spokesperson did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment on Sunday.  Myanmar's military has denied committing genocide against the Rohingya, who are denied citizenship in Myanmar, and said it was conducting an operation against terrorists in 2017.  A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded in 2018 that the military's campaign included ""genocidal acts,"" but Washington referred at the time to the atrocities as ""ethnic cleansing,"" a term that has no legal definition under international criminal law.  ""It's really signaling to the world and especially to victims and survivors within the Rohingya community and more broadly that the United States recognizes the gravity of what's happening,"" a second senior State Department official said of Blinken's announcement on Monday.  A genocide determination does not automatically unleash punitive U.S. action.  Since the Cold War, the State Department has formally used the term six times to describe massacres in Bosnia, Rwanda, Iraq and Darfur, the Islamic State's attacks on Yazidis and other minorities, and most recently last year, over China’s treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslims. China denies the genocide claims.  Blinken will also announce $1 million of additional funding for the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM), a United Nations body based in Geneva that is gathering evidence for potential future prosecutions.  ""It's going to enhance our position as we try to build international support to try to prevent further atrocities and hold those accountable,"" the first U.S. official said.  Days after U.S. President Joe Biden took office, Myanmar generals led by Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing seized power on Feb. 1, 2021, after complaining of fraud in a November 2020 general election won by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi's party. Election monitoring groups found no evidence of mass fraud.  The armed forces crushed an uprising against their coup, killing more than 1,600 people and detaining nearly 10,000, including civilian leaders such as Suu Kyi, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a campaign group, and setting off an insurgency.  Reuters was unable to independently verify the figures from the AAPP. The junta has said the group's figures are exaggerated and that members of the security forces have also been killed in clashes with those opposing the coup. The junta has not provided its own figures.  In response to the coup, the United States and Western allies sanctioned the junta and its business interests, but have been unable to convince the generals to restore civilian rule after they received military and diplomatic support from Russia and China.  Blinken's recognition of genocide and crimes against humanity refers mainly to events in 2017, before last year's coup. The step comes after two State Department examinations -- one initiated in 2018 and the other in 2020 -- failed to produce a determination.  Some former U.S. officials told Reuters those were missed opportunities to send a firm message to the Myanmar generals who later seized power.  Activists believe a clear statement by the United States that genocide was committed could bolster efforts to hold the generals accountable, such as a case in the International Court of Justice where The Gambia has accused Myanmar of genocide, citing Myanmar's atrocities against the Rohingya in Rakhine state.  Myanmar has rejected the charge of genocide and urged the court's judges to drop the case. The junta says The Gambia is acting as a proxy for others and had no legal standing to file a case.  The International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate court at The Hague, is also investigating the deportation of Rohingya from Myanmar, and the IIMM in Geneva is gathering evidence that could be used in future trials.  Myanmar opposes the investigations and has refused to cooperate, asserting the ICC does not have jurisdiction and that its decision to launch a probe was swayed by ""charged narratives of harrowing personal tragedies which have nothing to do with the legal arguments in question.""  John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said Myanmar's military has faced ""few real consequences for its atrocities, whether against Rohingya or other ethnic minority groups in Myanmar.""  As well as imposing more economic sanctions on the junta, the United States should press for a U.N. Security Council resolution that would refer all the military's alleged crimes to the International Criminal Court, Sifton said. If Russia and China veto a resolution, as is likely, Washington should lead action in the U.N. General Assembly, he said.  ""Condemnations of Myanmar should be coupled with concrete actions,"" he said.  Before Blinken made the decision this month, officials debated whether blaming Myanmar's government -- rather than specifically its military -- for the atrocities could complicate U.S. support for the country's deposed democratic forces, according to a source familiar with the matter.  The State Department opted to pin the blame on the military, said the second senior department official.  ""It's not clear to what degree the civilian leadership had control over actions that were happening in Rakhine State and so that's where the determination ends at this point,"" said that official, who did not comment on the internal deliberation.  Suu Kyi, forced to share power with the generals, traveled to the International Court of Justice in 2019 to reject the genocide charges brought by The Gambia.  She said the country would itself prosecute any soldiers found to have committed abuses, but maintained the alleged violations did not rise to the level of genocide, for which the specific intent to destroy a group has to be proven.  When they seized power, the generals put Suu Kyi on trial in nearly a dozen cases that could see her sentenced to more than 100 years in prison. She remains in detention. "
