Russia’s previously proposed security guarantees to the United States and NATO are no longer valid because the situation has changed drastically, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said on Saturday.
Asked in an interview with Russia’s Channel One television broadcaster whether Moscow’s proposals on security guarantees for the United States and NATO were still in force, Ryabkov replied that he ""would not be saying that proposals of such type may remain in force.""
""On the whole, the configuration has completely changed and the current situation is drastically different,"" the high-ranking diplomat said. ""The issue now is to provide for reaching the aims, which were set by our authorities before launching a special military operation.""
Ryabkov stressed that the Russian side resorted ""to its utmost efforts to maintain and provide for the European security architecture without a collapse, which emerged following an absolutely irresponsible and criminal policy implemented by the current regime in Kiev and its curators in the West, led by the United States.""
""If we speak about the future of the European security architecture as well as about the future regarding the arms control, the question is again about how our opponents, our enemies led by the United States, will be ready and whether they will be ready at all for talks,"" he said.
""We of course, if the Americans are willing, are ready to resume the dialogue and definitely are set and able to work in this direction, including within the frames of the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms [the New START Treaty], which stalled as well. Everything depends on Washington now,"" Ryabkov noted.
He also stated that on February 25, the day after Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine, ""American colleagues announced their decision to wrap up and close a dialogue on the strategic European security.""
""I would like to use this moment to warn them against taking incautious steps,"" Ryabkov added.
On December 17, 2021, the Russian Foreign Ministry published Russia’s two draft agreements on security guarantees, which Moscow expected from Washington and NATO.

""Instead of discussing the subject of European security, how to preserve and strengthen the architecture that has developed in Europe in recent decades, we were literally forced to discuss issues that have nothing to do with this,"" the diplomat said. ""We see what it led to. This is a strategic miscalculation on the part of the United States, its allies, clients, and its satellites.""

Rogozin said the foreign partners didn’t explain the reasons for and the content of the sanctions, despite repeated requests by Roscosmos.
The head of Roscosmos said that the Russian and US segments of the ISS are interconnected. The Russian segment is controlled from the Mission Control Center near Moscow (which is under sanctions), which ensures the maintenance of the station's orbit and provides backup for running the life support systems of the US segment. From 2010 to 2019, Russian manned spacecraft Soyuz MS were the only means of sending cosmonauts and astronauts aboard the ISS, while Progress MS spacecraft deliver cargo, food and fuel. Both craft are launched by Soyuz-2.1a boosters, which are produced at the Progress rocket and space center, which is also under sanctions.
""The Soyuz manned spacecraft and the Progress cargo spacecraft are currently the backup means of delivering foreign crews and cargo to the ISS and returning them to the Earth,"" Rogozin said.

""It shows that the destruction of the ISS poses the least danger to Russia,"" he said. ""But the population of some other countries, including those led by the ‘dogs of war,’ should think hard about the price of the sanctions they initiated against Roscosmos, and the price of the international cooperation in space, which is being obsessively destroyed by the West.

Possibility of Putin-Biden meeting not being looked at — Kremlin spokesman -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy,"MOSCOW, March 14. /TASS/. Moscow and Washington are not looking at organizing a meeting between Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Joe Biden of the United States, Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov told TASS on Monday.
The US media reported earlier that President Biden is expected to pay a visit to Europe to discuss the situation around Ukraine.
""No, there are no such discussions,"" Peskov said when asked whether a possible meeting between Presidents Putin and Biden is being looked at.
According to NBC TV, during his trip to Europe, Biden is likely to visit Brussels, where NATO and EU steering bodies are headquartered. No further details of the trip and its concrete dates have been provided.
Amid Russia’s special operation in Ukraine, the United States has repeatedly stressed that it maintains close cooperation and coordination with its European allies.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation in response to a request for help by the heads of the Donbass republics. He stressed that Moscow had no plans of occupying Ukrainian territories, but aimed to demilitarize and denazify the country.
When clarifying the unfolding developments, the Russian Defense Ministry reassured that Russian troops are not targeting Ukrainian cities, but are limited to surgically striking and incapacitating Ukrainian military infrastructure. There are no threats whatsoever to the civilian population.

"Halt of Russian energy imports could cost Germany up to 3% of GDP, study says -  Business & Economy","BERLIN, March 14. /TASS/. In the short term, a halt to Russian energy imports could cost Germany up to 3% of its gross domestic product, according to estimates by the EconPol Europe network. The results of the calculation were presented by the press service of Ifo (Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich).
The authors noted that imports of oil and coal could be replaced by supplies from other countries, but this is not so simple.
""Germany should take quick and decisive action to reduce its dependence on Russian gas. Without appropriate measures today, we run the risk of being vulnerable to blackmail this winter,"" says Prof. Karen Pittel, member of the EconPol network and Director of the ifo Center for Energy, Climate, and Resources.
""The cost of stopping energy imports would be significant, considering that the coronavirus pandemic cost about 4.5% of economic output,"" says Andreas Peichl, EconPol network member and Director of the ifo Center for Macroeconomics and Surveys. According to him, ""major economic slumps and upheaval cannot be ruled out either,"" as the strength of the potential shock injections a high degree of uncertainty into the simulation.
Peichl added that large parts of industry have not yet recovered from the effects of the pandemic, and that must also be taken into account.
 
The study says that replacing Russian gas imports is complicated.
""Gas could be imported from countries other than Russia, coal and nuclear energy could be used instead of gas in power generation, and gas reserves could be replenished over the summer. However, these measures would only partially offset the deficit in gas consumption over the next 12 months,"" the experts say.
In this regard, ""policies should aim to increase incentives for substituting and conserving fossil fuels as quickly as possible, even if an embargo is not imminent,"" they noted.
""Taking action now means we don’t have to make even tougher adjustments this year or next when push comes to shove. Since such a move would drive prices up even further, targeted support measures would have to be taken for industries and social groups that have been especially hard-hit,"" Pittel says as quoted by the press service.
Earlier, Vice-Chancellor, Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection of Germany Robert Habeck said that his country was ready to stop imports of Russian energy resources - oil, gas and coal. According to him, the German authorities have been working on such a scenario since December last year. Habeck argued that Germany could do without Russian gas supplies this winter, spring and summer. He also said that Germany intends to make every effort to diversify energy supplies ""with Tesla speed.""

""We will continue our strategic line toward developing, as part of the OEWG, the norms, principles and rules of responsible behavior of states in the information space and make them legally binding, promote the concept of the UN Convention on the provision of IIS (international information security - TASS), consolidate Russian approaches in a future UN convention against the use of ICTs for criminal purposes,"" he said.
Security and sovereignty
When asked whether Russia should think about reconsidering its approaches to accelerated digitalization, the deputy minister said that the digitalization process has already been launched and is irreversible. ""Digitalization of the economy is considered by many countries as one of the main drivers of their own development, ensuring security and protecting sovereignty,"" he said. ""For our country, the digital economy is designed to accomplish, among other things, the tasks of ensuring information security based on domestic developments in the transfer, processing and storage of data, which guarantees the protection of the interests of the individual, business and the state, as well as the creation of a global competitive infrastructure.""
""I will not take on technical issues that fall within the competence of other Russian government agencies,"" the diplomat went on to say. ""I will only touch on the political aspects of this area and the contribution of the Russian Foreign Ministry to this process.""
Syromolotov said that crimes in the information space are truly global in nature, cause significant damage to the economic activities of states, business structures and the well-being of millions of people and are increasingly used as a disguise to undermine the domestic social and political and social and economic situation and pose a threat their sovereignty.
 
The deputy minister said that at a Russian initiative, two main negotiating processes have been launched and are operating in the UN system. ""In accordance with UNGA Resolution No. 74/247 of December 27, 2019, a Special Committee was established to develop a comprehensive international convention on combating the use of ICT for criminal purposes,"" he said. ""The Russian representative was elected as its vice-chairman.""
""UNGA Resolution No. 75/282 that was proposed by us and adopted by consensus designated an acceptable plan and procedure for further work of the special committee,"" he said.
In addition, the deputy minister drew attention to the fact that on July 27 last year, Russia was the first among the UN member states to officially submit to the special committee a draft convention on combating the use of ICT for criminal purposes, which was co-sponsored by China, Belarus, Nicaragua and Tajikistan and received support from some other countries.
The most important trek, Syromolotov said, is the OEWG on security issues in the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and ICTs per se 2021-2025, which was created in accordance with UN General Assembly resolution No. 75/240 of December 31, 2020, and authorized to continue the development of rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior of states in the information space as one of its priorities.
According to the diplomat, by adopting on December 6 last year the consensus resolution of the UN General Assembly No. 76/19, proposed by Russia jointly with the United States, it was possible to consolidate the OEWG as the only negotiating mechanism on international information security under the auspices of the UN and confirm its mandate.
Important post
In addition, Syromolotov said that Russia expects Rashid Ismailov to take the post of Secretary General of the International Telecommunication Union. ""The most important thing for us is to promote the candidacies of Russian representatives to the governing bodies of the International Telecommunication Union: Rashid Ismailov for election as Secretary General of the International Telecommunication Union and Nikolay Varlamov for re-election as a member of the new composition of the committee of the Radio Regulations Board during the elections at the Plenipotentiary Conference in 2022 (Bucharest, September 26 - October 14, 2022 - TASS).""

""Moscow has paid attention to the recent statements from senior US and EU officials [National Security Advisor Jake] Sullivan and [EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep] Borrell that Putin is allegedly frustrated that his troops are not advancing in major cities, including Kiev, the way he thought they would, and that allegedly because of this he, Putin, increases the number of targets he attacks and tries to damage every part of the country,"" Peskov said.

Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 passenger flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed on July 17, 2014, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, killing 298 people on board, who were citizens of ten countries. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) announced in June 2019 that it had identified a group of four suspects involved in the incident. The prosecutor's office has demanded life imprisonment for all of the accused.
Russian officials have repeatedly expressed distrust in the results of the investigation team, pointing to the groundlessness of the prosecution's arguments and reluctance to use Moscow's findings in the investigation. Moreover, as the Russian Foreign Ministry previously recalled, Moscow initially proposed working together, but instead international investigators removed Russia from full participation in the JIT, assigning Russian efforts to just a secondary role.

Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has signed a law allowing the authorized banks to sell gold bars to individuals for currency. The document has been published at the website of official legal information.

urkey no longer considering purchase of Patriot missile systems from US -  Military & Defense,"Ankara, March 14. /TASS/. Ankara is no longer considering the possibility of purchasing the Patriot missile systems from the United States, Head of Turkey’s Presidency of Defense Industries Ismail Demir said on Monday.
""There is currently no demand for the Patriot missile systems. As far as our defense industry is concerned, we have closed this page,"" the Sabah newspaper quoted him as saying.
Meanwhile, in Demir’s words, the implementation of Ankara’s contract to purchase the S-400 air defense systems from Russia ""continues without any issues.""
Moscow and Ankara signed a contract for the delivery of the S-400 systems in 2017. Turkey became the first NATO country to purchase these systems from Russia. The US is still continuing efforts to push Turkey to abandon the Russian systems. In particular, Washington earlier excluded Ankara from the F-35 development program. The US also kept threatening to impose unilateral sanctions on Turkey over the S-400 deal but did not rush to take such steps for fear of further tensions with its key NATO ally as Ankara had warned that such restrictions would not go unanswered. However, Washington finally introduced the sanctions in question in December 2020.

Press review: Why Iran struck northern Iraq and EU may have to launch Nord Stream 2 -  Press Review,"Izvestia: What further talks between Russia and Ukraine may bring
 
Moscow and Kiev have chances of reaching compromises in talks, said experts interviewed by Izvestia. However, much will depend on the Ukrainian authorities’ ability to develop a common position. Political scientists have already taken note of some progress on the diplomatic track, but it’s too early to talk about positive outcomes.
Video talks with Russia’s delegation are going on non-stop, said Advisor to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s Office Mikhail Podolyak. At the same time, member of the Russian delegation and head of the State Duma’s Committee on International Affairs Leonid Slutsky specified that dialogue between Moscow and Kiev continued on the so-called Belovezhskaya Pushcha platform.
Deputy Chairman of the Russian Federation Council Foreign Affairs Committee Andrei Klimov believes that Russia and Ukraine could reach an agreement if Kiev was capable of making independent decisions. ""I can’t help feeling that some other forces, particularly those from Washington and the United Kingdom, are also involved in the conversation,"" he said.
According to Center for Political Analysis and Social Research Director Pavel Danilin, some positive messages have been voiced during the negotiations. Still, the fact that the statements by some of Kiev’s representatives sometimes run counter to what their own colleagues say complicates the situation.
The negotiation process between Russia and Ukraine is proceeding in a more intensive manner than it did in early March, Director General of the Agency for Political and Economic Communications Dmitry Orlov pointed out. ""The parties need to determine a common framework and a starting point for the talks in order to make sure that they produce results,"" he noted. According to the expert, the framework may include guarantees of Ukraine’s natural status for 20-25 years based on constitutional changes, the dissolution and disarmament of paramilitary groups such as the Azov Battalion and Ukraine’s consent to recognize Crimea as part of Russia and the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as independent states.
 
Nezavisimaya Gazeta: Iran attempts to divert global focus from Russia’s special operation
 
The Biden administration has been urged to abandon nuclear talks with Tehran after US facilities in northern Iraq came under missile fire in the early hours of March 13. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed responsibility, saying that Israeli intelligence positions had been targeted. The series of attacks came as a surprise for those who expected the talks on the Iran nuclear deal to resume, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.
Opinions started circulating on social media that in this way, Tehran sought to join in on Russia’s actions in Ukraine. However, experts are skeptical about this theory.
Russian International Affairs Council expert Anton Mardasov has doubts that Russian intelligence agencies could have held consultations with their Iranian and Chinese colleagues, asking them to rise up against the Americans. However, Tehran views the Ukrainian developments as part of a common struggle against the West, so it seeks to demonstrate its ability to exert pressure, the expert noted.
""Developments in Ukraine are some kind of a trigger that makes it possible for countries involved in the fight against the West to show their contribution to the battle against its ‘hegemony.’ As for the United States, where inflation rates had started to skyrocket even before all this happened, a new round of oil price hikes in the wake of the Iranian events is a very negative scenario,"" Mardasov emphasized.
""Perhaps, Russia could somehow benefit from a resurgence of Iran’s confrontation with the US and Israel because it diverts attention from the Ukrainian developments,"" the analyst said. ""It is sort of a favorable scenario because it to some extent makes countries address other frozen conflicts,"" Mardasov stressed. However, according to him, the incident may disrupt the Vienna talks.
 
Izvestia: Architecture of international relations to crumble without Russia, senior diplomat cautions
 
Russia will seek arbitral proceedings over the United States’ misuse of its position as the UN host in terms of visa issuance to Russian diplomats, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin said in an interview with Izvestia.
He slammed the recent US move to declare 12 diplomats from the Russian mission to the United Nations personae non grata as a blatant violation of the obligations that the United States has as a country hosting central UN bodies. ""We have repeatedly delivered demarches to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and we will continue to work with him because the issue needs to be resolved,"" the senior diplomat added.
When asked if it was possible to exclude Russia from the UN Security Council, Vershinin noted that such initiatives were ""completely unrealistic."" ""There are some procedural issues, since it takes two-thirds of UN member states to vote and ratify changes to the essential provisions that regulate the UN Security Council’s activities and membership. All five permanent members of the UN Security Council, including Russia, must be among those member states. Clearly, such a decision won’t pass,"" he explained.
""There is also another crucial thing. Without Russia, the entire architecture of international relations would crumble because Russia’s independent and balanced policy is what helps find solutions and prevent extreme decisions during discussions in the Security Council. And let’s be clear: as for the UN Security Council’s members, important African, Asian and Latin American countries are underrepresented there, while Western countries are overrepresented. That said, given their number, they are capable of pushing solutions that, in our view, aren’t in line with the global community’s goals and interests. This is why the veto power is very important for finding balanced and compromise solutions that are consistent with the need to resolve issues in the interests of the international community,"" the Russian deputy foreign minister emphasized.
 
Nezavisimaya Gazeta: Taiwan to resist potential assault by China according to Ukraine’s scenario
 
The United States has recommended that Taiwan take note of Ukraine’s experience and use US-made weapons and guerrilla tactics in case Chinese paratroopers land on the island. Meanwhile, former officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army say that in the event of an operation to unite the island with mainland China, the army’s main goal will be to minimize its own casualties and damage to civilians, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.
Senior Researcher at the Higher School of Economics Vasily Kashin believes that ""the experience of the military operation in Ukraine will be studied in depth throughout the world."" ""However, it is unclear what conclusions the Chinese will draw. The Chinese thoroughly study the military experience of other countries in a bid to offset the fact that they haven’t conducted military activities for 30 years. I think that it will be crucial for them to obtain information about ways to suppress air defenses and the impact that Russian air and missile strikes have had on Ukrainian airfields because this is what they will have to do if a conflict around Taiwan breaks out,"" the analyst noted.
As for guerilla tactics, China has more experience in the field than Ukraine and probably the entire world. For decades, providing weapons to the population has been an important part of the people’s war doctrine developed by Mao Zedong. ""China has a relevant doctrine and an organizational structure, and a militia made up of eight million people. They lead a normal civilian life and take part in military training once a year. These people are called up for dealing with the aftermath of natural disasters and maintaining public order,"" the expert explained.
The Taiwanese people aren't actually betting on a guerilla war, because if the Chinese army lands on Taiwan, seizes ports and continues to send more troops, it will gradually mop up the island. Particularly because the People's Armed Police may be sent to support regular troops. The People's Armed Police is 600,000 strong, while the Chinese army is 2 mln strong, Kashin said.
 
Rossiyskaya Gazeta: Europe may urgently need to launch Nord Stream 2
 
The issue of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline may return to the European forefront, if Russian gas transit via Ukraine stops. Until recently, such a development seemed impossible because there is a valid contract between the two countries until the end of 2024, but now, a simple failure may disrupt gas transit, Rossiyskaya Gazeta notes.
It appears to be impossible to offset the possible disruption of gas transit through Ukraine without launching Nord Stream 2, Deputy Director General of Russia’s National Energy Security Fund Alexei Grivach said. If Ukrainian transit stops and Europe’s demand for gas remains at last year’s level, then Russian gas shortages will amount to 25-30 bln cubic meters. However, Europe will most likely need more gas in 2022 because it will have to fill its underground storage facilities that were practically depleted during the winter. Fulfilling this objective may require about 60 bln cubic meters of gas.
Still, Finam analyst Sergey Kaufman believes that Nord Stream 2 is unlikely to be launched even in an emergency situation because the gas pipeline hasn’t been certified. According to the expert, the project can hardly be expected to be resumed following all the statements echoed by EU officials.
However, the political and economic situation in the world is rapidly changing. Just 18 months ago, no one could have imagined that oil, gas and coal prices would hit record highs. And here is where the question arises of how long the Nord Stream 2 pipeline can lie on the floor of the Baltic Sea without operation.
The pipes are new and their expected lifetime is 50 years, Grivach specified. However, they require regular maintenance. It is unclear if the project’s operator will be able to continue its activities to maintain the pipeline under sanctions. But all in all, the situation remains under control on both the Russian and German sides, the expert stressed.

Washington seeks to earn political points by blaming Russia for fuel crisis — embassy -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy,"WASHINGTON, March 16. /TASS/. The media campaign to blame the fuel crisis in the United States on Russia confirms Washington’s desire to earn political points on Russophobia, the Russian embassy in Washington said in its Telegram channel on Tuesday.
The embassy said it had noted a report by the Fox Business channel, which says that the White House officials have begun to involve popular bloggers in a propaganda campaign aimed at pinning the blame for the fuel crisis in the United States on the Russian leadership.
""This news confirms Washington's desire to earn political points on Russophobia. It is clear to reasonable people that the external enemy image of Russia is needed for the US leadership to justify its own failures in addressing domestic problems,"" the embassy said.
""Here they prefer to ignore the fact that the true cause of the crisis and the record inflation in the United States is unsecured trillion-dollar financial injections into the economy and sanctions wars against undesirable states,"" Russian diplomats continued.
They underscored that it wasn’t Russia’s decision to stop fuel supplies to the US.
""It was the US administration that ceased purchasing hydrocarbons from Russia, ignoring the needs of ordinary American citizens,"" the Russian diplomatic mission said. ""Russia is a reliable supplier of energy resources. This fact has been proven through decades of mutually beneficial partnership with all countries of the world.""
According to the Russian embassy, ""the politicization of economic problems by the United States has demonstrated its lameness, which is delivering a strong and painful blow to the welfare of ordinary Americans. Such a policy results in further deterioration of bilateral relations between Russia and the USA and causes a serious damage to the ties between our peoples.""

Zelensky dismissed military commander over missile strike at Donetsk — DPR -  World,"DONETSK, March 15. /TASS/. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky ruled to relieve of duty the commander of Kiev’s military operation in Donbass, Alexander Pavlyuk, over his decision to fire a Tochka-U missile towards Donetsk without authorization, deputy department head of the DPR Militia Eduard Basurin said on Tuesday.
""The decisive factor in Pavlyuk’s dismissal was his arbitrary decision to fire a missile with a cluster warhead from the Tochka-U tactical system towards the Donetsk city center, which left 21 citizens of the republic dead and 37 injured,"" Basurin said in a statement, posted in his Telegram channel.
Among other reasons behind the dismissal, he named several major failures of the Ukrainian armed forces in Donbass.
""According to our source, the military leadership of Ukraine lost credibility due to Pavlyuk’s total inability to organize proper defense of the Ukrainian armed forces, as well as due to the loss of Volnovakha and the blocking of Ukrainian troops in Mariupol,"" Basurin said.

Russia to put for voting its UNSC draft resolution on Ukraine on March 16 -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy,"UNITED NATIONS, March 15. /TASS/. Russia will put its draft resolution on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine for voting at the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday, Russian First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky said on Tuesday.
According to the Russian diplomat, the text of the resolution initiated by France and Mexico, which they have decided to put for voting at the UN General Assembly, was 99% agreed. ""It was not put for voting only because our Western colleagues want to fill it with political elements condemning Russia, which cannot be included in humanitarian resolutions,"" he wrote on his Telegram channel.
""We initiated our draft based on the 99% agreed text and asked to put it for voting tomorrow, on March 16,"" he noted.
According to the Russian diplomat, Russia has been emphasizing from the very beginning that it is not against the humanitarian resolution if it is not politicized. ""But the Western colleagues’ zeal to condemn Russia has won the upper hand. That is why they have opted for a maneuver with the General Assembly where they can push for any amount of anti-Russian amendments,"" Polyansky noted. ""It will be a political show that will in no way influence the humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.""

"Russia may avoid default getting access to frozen gold and currency reserves, say experts -  Business & Economy","MOSCOW, March 15. /TASS/. Russia has all chances to avoid a default, using its gold and currency reserves, which are currently frozen over the sanctions. If the sides fail to agree on how Moscow will be able to perform its external debt payments though it is the west that will be hit, experts interviewed by TASS suggest.
Earlier, Moody’s rating agency downgraded Russia’s sovereign rating to junk ‘Ca’ level, while Fitch - from B to C, noting that the sovereign default was inevitable.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said that the organization no longer considered a default in Russia improbable.
A default is a failure to fulfill a loan agreement, meaning a failure to repay interest or the main debt on debt liabilities or on terms of an agreement on a bond issue in due time. A default may be announced both by companies and individuals, and by states (sovereign default) unable to service all or part of their liabilities. A sovereign default occurs if a state cannot meet its obligations to domestic or external private creditors (usually commercial banks) in due time.
In modern Russia, a default occurred in 1998 when the country failed to repay domestic short-term bonds.
Why Russia may face a default
According to the figures provided by the Finance Ministry, as of February 1, 2022, Russia’s external state debt amounted to $59.5 bln, including indebtedness on external bond loans equaling $38.97 bln. In total Russia has 15 current bond loans due from 2022 to 2047.
On March 16, Russia is to repay coupons on the external debt to the tune of $117 mln. The state has funds to repay debts, though it cannot use its gold and currency reserves due to the sanctions, which means it cannot repay in foreign currency. According to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, the country has accumulated around $640 bln, of which it cannot use around $300 bln now.
Responding to the sanctions on March 5, Russian President Vladimir Putin permitted repaying foreign currency debts to ‘unfriendly’ countries in rubles. According to the decree, debtors - companies or the state itself - can open an account in Russian banks in the name of a foreign creditor and transfer payments to it in rubles at the exchange rate of the Bank of Russia as of the date of payment. Creditors from the states that did not impose sanctions, can receive a payment in euros or dollars if the Russian debtor receives a corresponding permit.
The Finance Ministry intends to exercise this right. The next payments on Russia’s sovereign Eurobonds are on March 16. The finance chief has already stated that Moscow would repay debt in foreign currency only if its currency accounts are unfrozen. In the event of a refusal or the lack of a reply from agent banks Russia will repay and service its currency liabilities in rubles.
However, this will substantially change the terms of servicing Russia’s external bond debt, which will most likely be regarded as a default.
Is it possible to avoid default?
Russia has chances to avoid this scenario, Chief Strategist at Aton Alexander Kudrin believes. ""I think, considering the revised OFAC license, theoretically it allows performing all necessary payments, for example, using the frozen funds of the Central Bank’s international reserves and thus avoid a default,"" he explained.
On March 14, Siluanov stated that Russia was ready to perform state debt payments in rubles at the exchange rate of the Bank of Russia, particularly as it was possible on Eurobonds issued since 2018.
If it occurs, the upcoming default will be poles apart from the situation of 1998 when Russia was in desperate need for money, whereas today there are enough funds, it simply cannot use them, Alfa-Capital’s analyst Alexander Dzhioyev said.
""The principal difference is that Russia was in desperate need for money then, and the default occurred not because of technical inability to pay on bonds, but because very many bonds were issued, and the wheel stopped working at some point as no refinancing was available, which ruined all the mechanism. Whereas now reserves are sufficient, but it is impossible to use them,"" the expert said.
""From the viewpoint of economy in general - export, import, the possibility to provide food - the situation in principally different now. The default in 1998 was painful mainly for Russia, whereas now it is painful for the majority of countries. Moreover, for Russia it is not the most painful,"" Dzhioyev added.

EU sanctions against Russia won’t disrupt energy supply of Hungary — Foreign Minister -  Business & Economy,"VIENNA, March 15. /TASS/. New sanctions of the European Union against Russia will affect neither Hungary’s energy supply nor its joint energy projects with Moscow, including the construction of the Paks 2 nuclear power plant, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Tuesday.
He was commenting on the EU decision to adopt the fourth package of sanctions against Russian companies and individuals.
""Hungarian energy supply is secure"", the minister said in his video address on Facebook. He stressed that Hungary will show solidarity with other EU members but the Hungarian people ""should not pay the price"" for sanctions against Moscow imposed due to Russia’s actions in Ukraine.
""Energy security of Hungary is the red line for us"" that should not be crossed, Szijjarto said.
He added that Hungary will continue to receive Russian gas, and the Hungarian energy company MOL will continue to work in Russia, including the development of the Baitugan oil field (Orenburg region).
The sanctions should not affect the construction of two new units of the nuclear power plant in Paks, about 100 kilometers south of Budapest. ""Sanctions will not do any harm"" to this project, which is being carried out with Russian participation, the minister said.
About joint projects
Last September, Hungary signed two long-term contracts with Gazprom, which provide for the supply of a total of 4.5 billion cubic meters of gas per year through pipelines going through Serbia and Austria, bypassing Ukraine. The agreement was concluded designed for 15 years and can be reviewed 10 years after the start of implementation. However, in its current form, it will not meet all of Hungary's needs for Russian gas, the rest will have to be purchased from Gazprom through its trader on a short-term basis. Therefore, Budapest would like to increase gas supplies through Serbia by 1 billion cubic meters per year. This issue was discussed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his visit to Moscow in early February.
As for Paks 2, it is expected that the construction of the second stage of the plant will begin after the issuance of all necessary permits by the national atomic energy agency.
Currently, there are four power units with VVER-440 type reactors at the nuclear power plant built according to the Soviet project on the banks of the Danube. It is planned that two new VVER-1200 reactors will be launched by the end of this decade. The Hungarian government hopes that, together with the development of solar energy, this will allow the country to become independent from electricity imports.

Lavrov warns US biolabs pose deadly threat to enormous amount of people -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy,"MOSCOW, March 15./TASS/. The activity of American biological laboratories is replete with life-threatening dangers to a huge number of civilians, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a news conference after talks with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.
""I am confident that the global community has fully realized and is yet to fully realize the inadmissibility of such activities which are actually chock-full of deadly threats to a huge number of civilians,"" Lavrov said.
According to him, the unearthed facts show the colossal scope of the US illegitimate activity to spread its military biological laboratories across the world.

And many were set up in a number of former Soviet countries precisely along the perimeter of Russia’s borders, as well as on China’s borders, and on the borders of the other countries located there,"" he stressed.
""We will demand, in this situation, that first this problem be considered within the context of the commitments for all countries participating in the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Secondly, we will double and triple our efforts to make the Americans stop blocking our proposal submitted 20 years ago, about the need to establish a special verification mechanism under this convention for any alarming reports that there are agents out there that can be used to make biological weapons,"" he noted.
The US is against this mechanism, since it will ensure the transparency of any biological activity, the top diplomat stressed. ""The Americans don’t want to see this transparency, since it is more convenient for them to do everything under their control, which is what they are still doing,"" Lavrov stressed.
Earlier, Chief of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops Igor Kirillov informed that a network of over 30 biological laboratories was set up in Ukraine, contracted by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).

Russian and Ukrainian delegations held another round of talks via video conference on March 14. Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Mikhail Podolyak later announced a technical pause in the negotiations until March 15. Ukraine’s position in the fourth round remained unchanged as Kiev continued to demand a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, Vedomosti notes.
It will be difficult for the parties to take the talks to another level, Russian International Affairs Council Director General Andrey Kortunov pointed out. According to him, they are only capable of making agreements on humanitarian corridors but mutual claims emerge even when these issues are discussed.
It’s hardly possible to talk about serious changes in Kiev’s position at the moment, particularly because Ukraine needs to save face amid the tough emotional state of society, namely its far-right nationalist members, Senior Researcher with the Institute of Post-Soviet and Interregional Studies at the Russian State University for the Humanities Alexander Gushchin noted. Besides, Ukraine’s position also results from the impact of its US partners. The expert expects Kiev to focus on attempts to delay a decision on recognizing the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and Crimea’s status, dilute the concept of demilitarization and take on as little obligations as possible in terms of neutrality, replacing the idea with talk of security guarantees.
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky is not interested in substantive negotiations, said Mikhail Barabanov, an expert at the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies. The West believes that Russia has been caught in trouble so the only thing that needs to be done is continue to support Ukraine. So it’s too early to say that Russia’s military success will push Ukraine towards real negotiations, the expert emphasized. Moreover, even if agreements are made, there are no guarantees that Ukraine will implement them, Barabanov added.

In particular, China owns $1 trillion worth of US treasury bonds and if it is announced at some point that there are no more rules, then the United States will be able to freeze these assets the way it did with those of the Russian Central Bank. In addition, Chinese airlines operate flights on Boeing and Airbus aircraft and if need be, the collective West can ground Chinese civilian flights in a few weeks. A blockade of maritime communications and a ban for international transport companies on entering China’s ports would expose Beijing to the threat of an energy crisis,"" the expert pointed out.
However, in Lomanov’s words, these scenarios should for now be viewed only as hypothetical, given that measures against China may provoke shocks that the global economy would not survive. ""All this will only become possible if the Biden administration decides to go to the limit in its attempts to put pressure on Russia. As for China, it will continue to resist pressure particularly because Washington has nothing to offer but threats,"" the analyst concluded.
 
Nezavisimaya Gazeta: West running out of severe sanctions steam against Russia
 
The European Union has announced the fourth package of sanctions against Russia. The most significant ones include a ban on the import of Russian steel products and the move to revoke Russia’s most-favored nation status in trade. The West is also considering ways to expel Russia from the World Trade Organization (WTO). Experts don’t expect the latter measure to actually change anything for Moscow, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.
Executive Director of the Capital Market Department at Univer Capital Artem Tuzov believes that the political will to act against Russia can easily be found within the WTO. However, he doesn’t view WTO-related sanctions as a particular threat for Russia.
""The move to revoke Russia’s most-favored nation status within the WTO will actually change nothing for Russia. Many WTO members have already restricted trade with Russia, currency transactions have also been limited. It’s hard to imagine how else to restrict trade. More likely, Russia’s status in the WTO will be legally brought in line with reality. In fact, WTO rules stopped working for Russia back in 2014. On the contrary, attempts were made to hold Moscow accountable for restricting the import of certain goods though the measure had come in response to similar restrictions against Russia,"" Tuzov pointed out.
""In a situation where the European Union has imposed illegal unilateral sanctions on Moscow, it’s strange to expect Russia’s most-favored nation status to be maintained as it is in fact no longer active. This is why the move is more of a politically symbolic one and won’t have consequences,"" a source in the Russian government told the newspaper. ""What is important is the measures that these countries will take, citing the revoking of Russia’s most-favored nation status. It is yet unclear if there will be an increase in import duties on everything or just selected goods, more import and export restrictions,"" the source added.
 
Rossiyskaya Gazeta: Russia’s Central Bank likely to maintain high key rate
 
Russia’s Central Bank is currently unlikely to change its key rate, which recently was raised to 20%, said experts interviewed by Rossiyskaya Gazeta. It’s hardly possible to reduce the rate in the present situation.
It’s too early to evaluate the effect of the move to increase the rate, which was an emergency measure aimed at preventing a flight of deposits from the banking system and, along with tough currency restrictions, has played a role at this stage, Macroeconomic Analysis Chief at Finam Olga Belenkaya emphasized.
""The decision to hike the key rate to 20% was first and foremost a signal aimed at reducing the outflow of money into foreign currency and cash, which was painful for the banking system. Now, the outflow into foreign currency has actually been stopped by restrictions and the outflow into cash has slowed down, according to the Central Bank’s bank liquidity data for last week,"" said Russia and CIS Economists at the Renaissance Capital investment company Sofya Donets and Andrey Melashchenko.
Meanwhile, the level of the key rate seems to be losing its paramount importance in the current situation. It’s possible that the Central Bank will announce additional measures to ensure financial stability, Belenkaya noted.
""The system is operating in an unusual mode as we are far from a normal situation where general market economy laws are in effect,"" Donets and Melashchenko stressed. In their view, it’s yet unclear how the geopolitical events will change the system. ""Russia’s Central Bank will be in the spotlight more than ever before. It means that the importance and significance of its decisions on the key rate will remain high,"" the analysts added.
 
Kommersant: Russia moves to lift mask mandates
 
The Moscow authorities decided to lift mandatory mask wearing due to a lasting improvement in the coronavirus situation, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin announced. Other regions of the country are following Moscow’s footsteps and ending mask mandates, Kommersant writes.
According to Assistant Professor at Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University’s Department of Children's Infectious Diseases Ivan Konovalov, national and global experience shows that masks are effective amid seasonal increases in respiratory infections but the decision to end mask mandates is understandable. ""The Omicron coronavirus variant proved to be highly contagious, and based on the analysis of data on severe forms of the disease and hospitalizations, decisions were made to use various methods to prevent the infection from spreading. Mask wearing turned out to be less important than getting vaccinated and receiving booster shots in time,"" Konovalov noted.
Most Russians did not care about wearing face coverings so the measure was hardly effective, Director of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Medical Research at the European University in St. Petersburg Anton Barchuk emphasized. This is why, in his words, the lifting of mask mandates is just a formality. ""Europe is currently recording a rise in Omicron cases. We don’t know yet what the situation will be like in Russia because our population profile is different from that in European countries,"" he added. ""There are more vaccinated people and fewer recovered patients there, while the situation is the opposite in Russia. In any case, we can see that the mortality rate won’t probably be so high anymore,"" the expert said.
Meanwhile, Konovalov emphasized that the virus was still there. According to him, coronavirus peaks will gradually become seasonal. And if natural and artificial immunity proves ineffective against any new variant that may emerge, the need to adjust vaccines will arise.

"""To fix what’s broken."" How charity rehabilitation center works -  Society & Culture","MOSCOW, March 15. /TASS/. The Metelitsa team is the only female team in the world with a record of 20 expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic (Metelitsa is a poetic, diminutive word for ‘snowstorm’). The girls have top ranking in sports, in skiing, orienteering, radio sports, parachuting, mountain tourism. Their last expedition to the high latitudes was in the late 1990s. Their followers, pupils and friends have been working at the rehabilitation center not far from Moscow.
After those expeditions, the girls opened a new page in their lives. One day, not far from their office they saw disabled boys. The boys were unable to join the games of their friends. The Metelitsa team decided to support the kids. At first, they made joint trips across the Moscow Region. ""We assist downed pilots,"" the girls say.
House for ""downed pilots""
In a small rented cottage in the Penino village, the team has organized a guesthouse for people with most complicated disorders. Only seven people can stay and train there at a time. Others receive consultations from home. Presently, Metelitsa has 120 clients in different cities - from the Moscow region to Kamchatka. Regretfully, sometimes they have to refuse new applications - due to the funding shortage.
- Our clients are ""downed pilots."" They all have negative rehabilitation potentials. They all have been refused, they are not worth services or upgrades. Till a certain time, we were not earning enough. The next stage was a storm - the more people learn the more clients come. I fear to move forward - we’ll be under an avalanche, - Svetlana Samara said. She is the president of the Metelitsa International Organization.
The first to meet visitors coming to Penino are the dogs. Four curious creatures, that are here also for good reasons. The fussy, noisy hosts make this special atmosphere, which is so different from the urban life. Other hosts are hens and cat Pulya (Bullet).
The dogs are barking, and Svetlana’s cell is barking to notify incoming texts. Calls and messages keep coming without breaks.
- Every day, people address us, but we are short of reserves. Right now, a teenager in Kostroma needs us badly. We can’t imagine what to do. We do consult people to explain to them how they must be moving steadily on and on. We teach them how to practice at home. Some people take this with understanding, but at times people get rude, Svetlana said.
She explains non-stop why so many people are apply to them.
 
- After any accident, people as a rule spend a month at hospital. Some have to remain there for six months, or even longer. The first six months is the survival. Later on, begins the time, where the person and the family have to get adjusted to the situation. At that time, people normally think - they will leave hospital, stay at home for a while, and then will begin the rehab period.
Here, they realize getting a rehab is not so easy. Bedsores, tracheostomy (a surgically created hole for a special tube to allow breathing), gastrostomy (an artificial hole connecting the anterior abdominal wall and stomach with a tube so that food and medicines are injected through it) are contraindications to half of the procedures. Such contraindications are very numerous. People get refusals from state-run clinics. Commercial centers are too expensive for most families.
- Families sell out whatever they have to buy a two-month rehab program. At the same time, a spinal fracture recovery may take from one year to five years, or even longer. As time goes by, the family and the patient get exhausted both in terms of money and in terms of patience, Svetlana said.
Yura
Yura, Sergey, Nikita and Kesha workout in the gym, which Metelitsa’s staff has built. Looking at them, it’s not easy to realize their hard years-long work. Yura is standing inside a device, which keeps him upright, and seems to be doing nothing. Unless you learn how it all began.
He got injured at the age of 18: he was sitting on the windowsill, couldn't keep the balance, and slipped off. Off the fourth floor. He crashed into an air conditioner, smashed the head, and broke the neck, thoracic spine, a leg and an arm.
Who could take care of the boy: by that time the mother had passed away, and the father was working in long shifts. Neighbors, whenever they could, came to visit Yura and take care of him.
Yura said the true fear and despair began when he saw a rat, which used to come through a hole in the floor. ""It was clear, it used to come at the same time, day after day, searching for food, and that food was me."" The rat bit the boy’s heels and bedsores. ""I realized - soon would come the time that the rat will bring along other rats. I was panicking, I wrote to everyone I could think about, asking for help. Not a single fund has replied. Later on, I came across the story of Lena Sheryshova - Metelitsa’s client."" By that time, Yura had remained in bed for 26 months.
 
- When he was brought here, his condition was that he could barely control the head. There was a difficult situation with the bladder stuffed with 350 ml of stones. The first thing we did: we dealt with the bedsores, fed him intensively, treated the bladder. Yura had to lie on his stomach for nine months. Later, we were able to turn him over and have him sit. Yura underwent surgery to straightened the arms. Now, he can hold the head, work with hands, sit. He entered the Psychological and Pedagogical Institute to study conflict management, and besides he learns to become an SMM marketer, - Svetlana said.
Metelitsa handles all problems in a complex. Traumas reset the entire previous life of a person, including the education. Yura had studied to be a foundry worker. He will never be able to do that job.
- When Yura sent to us the photos of bedsores, we got horrified. We called the local medicine. Alexey Fedosov, the head physician of the Central Hospital in the city of Gay, helped us a lot. It took me quite a time to explain to him on the phone who we are and what we want. We had a problem — how to transport Yura to the airport. The nearest city is Orsk. There was silence on the phone, I thought the line was lost, and even asked if the doctor was there. He asked me again, in a very calm voice: ""Are you really going to take him? And for how long?"" I answered: ""Until he gets up."" The doctor replied that he would do everything to get Yura to the airport on time. ""Here, he will die. I can't do anything,"" said Svetlana. — He perfectly and accurately performed everything in compliance with the law - to the extent we could hardly believe.""
Inside the device, keeping the patient’s vertical position, Yura now can stand for one hour - this is his first and great step towards the victory.
Lena
- Quite often we pick a patient, but we don't know what awaits us. When we spoke to Lena on the phone, she said that she had problems with her leg and it may be amputated. When we arrived there, we asked a surgeon to examine Lena. The doctor saw other problems and ordered to have an MRI. I ask: ""MRI of what? She replied, ""MRI of everything.""
Lena is 22. In April, 2017, she was pushed off the eighth floor.
 
Within the first five months after the injury, the girl underwent five surgeries. She spent six weeks inside the Ilizarov device, two months with stretching weights screwed into the skull (the spine traction is a specific technique in which traction is used to treat muscle spasm, deformities in the vertebral column and dislocations of the vertebrae; the constant stretching eliminates problems and keeps the spine in good shape).
Due to a lack of care, Lena’s bedsores had been growing.
- In the MRI images, we saw a set of bones that were ""scattered around"" in the area where the pelvis must be. The sacrum was loose, the spine was fractured in the lumbar part, eight fractures in the pelvis. By that time, Lena had been at home for almost a year. She had been told: ""You're lazy, you need to learn to walk."" No one believed that Lena couldn't do it. The hospital’s file read the girl can walk. But the images showed something completely different, - Svetlana said.
Lena has undergone 21 surgeries. More surgeries are to come: to reconstruct the pelvis and the spine. In the past, such surgeries were made in Yekaterinburg, but they cannot help Lena.
The only hospital in the world, ready to examine Lena, is in Saloniki. Greek specialists are very experienced in treating traumas, when people fall off from a height. The examination’s cost is 3,100 euros, excluding flight and accommodation expenses.
Lena has passed the secondary school graduation exams, entered a university, plans to take another course; she’s been Svetlana’s administrative assistant.
Katya
Katya is 37. She’s a radiologist doctor. Together with her husband and a one-year-old child, she got in a traffic accident. The car overturned a few times.
""I can remember that after the accident I realized I couldn't feel the arms or legs, and I could hear the sound of dripping blood. Then was the surgery, a month at the intensive care unit. The neurosurgeons were very afraid for my life, they ""fixed"" me in the Philadelphia collar and told everyone not to touch me. This is how a bedsore was developing. The doctors were reasonably afraid, a week after the surgery, I managed to present a cardiac arrest. They did bring me back,"" - Katya said.
Katya’s case is the most complicated for Metelitsa now. Since mid-November, the team has been fighting to have Katya get a surgery to reconstruct the cervical spine. The structure has been unstable. So far, all clinics have refused.
 
- The ""last hand rule"" in medicine does exist. We can understand that no one wants to correct other people's mistakes. If the surgery is not successful, then in terms of reputation and statistics the responsibility will fall on the doctor who made the last surgery, — Svetlana said. — Without a surgery Katya will remain paralyzed forever and her chances will be very low. In case of a surgery, she will at first sit in a wheelchair, then we will be able to put her on feet and she will at least walk with a walker.
Katya continues working. It is extremely important to remain of demand, she said.
She takes close to heart the complicated cases and the people’s pain, that she can see in the disorders on MRI images, which colleges sent to her awaiting annotations.
Her communication with the son is online. At home, in Tomsk, the cameras are very helpful when they learn poems or songs.
- What will I do first thing when I manage to walk? I’ll go to the stadium. I even can imagine how it looks, - Katya said.
Bring back to feet within one year
- Getting back to feet is not the objective. I can have a dead body stand, - said Andrey Samara, Svetlana’s husband. He is Metelitsa’s vice president, a coach and the team’s methods chief expert. - Every person must have a goal. Why to get to feet. That goal must be very clear. For example, Sergey wants to take the daughter to her first school lesson on September 1. Nikita could not make any progress until he got adamant he wanted to be a doctor, a rehab specialist, - and he started working hard.
Many patients give in, whenever they learn that hard work takes years. People tend to get used to the new conditions and put up with remaining inside those situations.
- Sergey was practicing rehab at home, but he was doing only what he could imagine. Noteworthy, there are very many aspects. Any rehabilitation must be ongoing. In case of anything wrong or quick, the process may become ineffective. A person may get stuck at a certain stage, without further progress. Very often people begin training and then face vegetation crises: when lifted, they may faint, - Andrey said.
 
Every person working at Metelitsa continues education. Every specialist is universal. To train patients, to heap up the snow in the yard, to cook dinner. Their attitude to food is very special - in a family style. Practically all patients coming to Metelitsa are exhausted. Every new kilo matters.
- A first-grade disabled, injured at the age of 20 and remaining at home, means the state support worth millions just in pensions, medicines and so forth. The disabled ""pulls"" from regular life at least another family member. In the old age, the person has to stay at a psycho-neurological facility, - Svetlana said. - Help us with the funds, and we will bring such a person back to feet within one year, unless there’s no spinal cord rupture. The person will be able to work, to have a family and kids.
Metelitsa’s dream is to have a rehab center for 50 patients, which could receive free and commercial services. They have unique experiences, a team, and the successful results of 300 people, whom they have taught to walk. But they do not have money.
- One of the tricks is how to make a post on social networks so that it does not sound pleading - ""we are so miserable and unhappy."" I never post pictures, where could be seen diapers, or where the patients look gloomy. The rate of pain and suffering is so high in the society. People have to face so many own problems, that they may not have strength to see how miserable other people are, - Svetlana said. - We need just elementary things: detergent, groceries, diapers, catheters. And also - a strategic partner who will be able to help with [obtaining of] a land plot for the construction of a center.
Happy stories
On the first floor is the kitchen, which is never idle. Somebody there is cooking, or giving a consultation, or continues talks. Doggies are fussing around the feet. Somebody is making coffee. Sometimes, donors come to the center - mostly individuals. A regular family-style life goes on. For many people this is their first true family.
- Why? - Svetlana thinks for a moment. - You know, I can’t stand anything broken. I need to have it fixed. Nobody will do it if not us. We know a few children, who have been born because at some point we had helped their parents. They are our children, too.
A few happy stories are more impressive than the other 300. Lidiya. A drunk driver crashed her car, when she was waiting for the green light. Her car turned upside down and caught fire. Happily, the fire fighters were nearby. The girl was taken to hospital: a fractured pelvis, injured legs, a broken arm.
A few complicated surgeries followed, Svetlana said. A year at hospitals. The result: inactive leg (suspected pelvis complex injury) and unbending elbow. The girl was unable to walk or take care of herself.
Metelitsa organized for the girl a complex of consultations. Lida spent a week at the clinic and continued the rehabilitation at Metelitsa for three months. She began to walk, the elbow improvement was 50%. With the support from Metelitsa, she recovered and entered a university to become a lawyer. With the injuries she had, Lidiya could not continue working as desired - a cook. Lidiya is married with a daughter.
""Or, for example, Artyom. At the age of 30, he lost both legs in an accident. Eight surgeries. His friends have addressed us,"" Svetlana said.
The psychologist kept persuading Artyom: ""You can do everything, everything is in your hands, the sooner you get into the stroller, the better! Swing, train, don't be shy of anyone. You are the most important thing. As for the car, you may have it equipped with a manual drive.""
""We’ve done everything we could,"" Svetlana told us. - Igor’s family has done everything possible. We’ve addressed everything - from father’s shock to the phantom pain - and we did it.""
Artyom uses both a wheelchair and a car, he has returned to the work. He has got married, and now has a daughter.
You are incredible, people!
""All of a sudden, today. I was standing, and here’s a step forward! All by myself! Yes! Four years of wheelchairs, sticks and crutches! Four years of tortures! Guys, friends, everyone who’s helped me to get up! We’ve done it! I’m not depressed or smashed! I’ve survived, and I’m with you now! A few clumsy steps - it’s beyond me! You are incredible, people!"" this is what Kristina Lukina, Metelitsa’s client and a staff member posted.
Metelitsa does not keep secret its progress. The team trains and helps those who need their experience. However, not everyone has similar success, and Svetlana often hears the question-What’s your secret?
Her answer is very simple and Christian. Love.

Expert: Development of tourism in Arctic boosts companies’ ESG ratings -  Society & Culture,"MOSCOW, March 15. /TASS/. The companies that develop tourism in the Russian Arctic receive higher ESG ratings and thus attract more successfully investors and bank loans, Associate Professor at the Public Administration and Public Policy Department of the Institute of Social Sciences of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration under the President of the Russian Federation (RANEPA), and coordinator of the Center for Development of the Arctic (PORA) Alexander Vorotnikov told TASS on Monday.
""A company’s participation in development of the tourism business in the Arctic has a most positive influence on its ESG image, its ESG rating,"" the expert said. ""Consequently, it is easier for the company to attract investors, and clients have positive perception of the company’s products.""
According to him, development of tourism in the Russian Federation’s Arctic Zone raises the credit rating by banks, which take into account ESG ratings. ""From the point of view of the modern ESG approach in management, the S factor, that is the social factor, is growing. Thus, it would be possible to cut the population escape, which affects the demographic situations both in the Russian Federation’s Arctic Zone and in Siberia and the Far East,"" he continued. ""It is also very important that in the implementation of such projects companies structure relations with the local business communities by including them in the logistics chains of supplies for tourism facilities, including locally made food products.""
The expert pointed to the importance to develop ecology tourism at nature reserves. Thus, companies have higher E factors, related to the environment. He spoke about the development of corporate ecology volunteer movement as an example of this development.
While speaking about the domestic tourism development, he stressed the Russian Arctic, the regions of Siberia and the Far East would be of high demand in the growing market. ""Many Russian companies have been developing their tourism businesses there. There are dozens of examples - including, for example, the projects Nornickel has on the Putorana Plateau and on the Kola Peninsula. In the Murmansk Region, PhosAgro has a big tourism project. The Renova Group plans to develop the tourism businesses on the Kamchatka,"" he added.
For many big industrial groups tourism projects are instruments to keep the staff, and additionally such projects add to companies’ positive images among the local population, and the locals receive jobs under such projects. The participation of a Russian company in such important ecology-social projects in the Russian territory undoubtedly will make such a company more attractive for a foreign investor as well as for clients, the expert said.
About ESG
ESG parameters, which business uses in sustainable development strategies, are: the environment issues (E), the social sphere (S) and corporate governance standards (G).
Many Western countries have been using ESG financing - a special approach to financing that includes environmental care, social development and corporate governance. This approach has become popular among Russian companies. Russia has been working on ""green"" financing, where a project funding is offered on the condition a business improves the environment, mitigates the climate change effects and uses resources most efficiently.

US Senate adopts resolution condemning Russia’s actions in Ukraine -  World,"WASHINGTON, March 16. /TASS/. The Senate of the US Congress voted unanimously on Tuesday to adopt a resolution condemning Russia’s actions regarding Ukraine and urging to hold Russia responsible for alleged military crimes committed on the US territory.
The document condemns ""the Russian Federation, President Vladimir Putin, members of the Russian Security Council, the Russian Armed Forces and Russian military commanders for committing flagrant acts of aggression and other atrocities rising to the level of crimes against humanity and war crimes against the people of Ukraine and others.""
Moreover, the upper chamber of the US parliament ""encourages member states to petition the ICC [International Criminal Court] and the ICJ [the International Court of Justice] to authorize any and all pending investigations into war crimes and crimes against humanity,"" which the document claims were committed by Russia.
The resolution also ""encourages the United States Government and partner nations to use their voice, vote and influence in international institutions in which they are members"" to hold the Russian leadership ""accountable for their sponsorship of the ongoing violence.""
The resolution was put forward by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and supported by a group of representatives from both parties. The document is not binding and only reflects the opinion of the upper chamber.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an early morning televised address on February 24 that he had launched a special military operation in Ukraine in response to a request for help from the leaders of the Donbass republics. He stressed that Moscow had no intention of occupying Ukrainian territories. Furthermore, the sole purpose of the operation, the leader emphasized, is the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops are not targeting Ukrainian cities, but are incapacitating Ukrainian military infrastructure, therefore there are no threats to the civilian population.

Russian envoy says West sees Ukrainian humanitarian situation based on disinformation -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy,"UNITED NATIONS, March 18. /TASS/. Russia’s UN envoy Vasily Nebenzya on Thursday said Western countries base their assessments of humanitarian situation in Ukraine on disinformation.
""We are sharing UN concerns about the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding in some regions of Ukraine, the envoy said at a UN Security Council meeting on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. ""Our colleagues at the Security Council are fairly pointing at that, too.""
""However, the difference is that the assessments of some states, in particular Western ones, are based, in addition to the situation with refugees, on a disinformation campaign that has been fanned from the very beginning of the Russian special military operation in Ukraine and is being pushed to increasingly higher levels,"" Nebenzya said.
Mariupol resistance
The Russian envoy also said Ukrainian radicals are putting up stiff resistance in Mariupol because the city holds evidence of their crimes.
""Mariupol was one of the main centers of resistance in the DPR,"" he said. ""Its residents almost unanimously supported the republic’s independence during a referendum and actively opposed the nationalist regime in Kiev.""
""The Ukrainian Nazis didn’t forget this,"" the diplomat went on to say. ""Having drowned the city in blood, they turned it into a kind of headquarters and a stronghold of volunteer Nazi battalions, primarily Azov and the Right Sector (banned in Russia).""
""That’s why Ukrainian radicals are refusing to let go of this city,"" Nebenzya continued. ""Firstly, it hides a lot of evidence of their crimes, and secondly, they understand that they will have to answer for this.""
""Therefore, they are ready to drag the entire population of Mariupol to the grave with them,"" he said.
Handouts of weapons
On another subject, Nebenzya said the incidents in the Ukrainian city of Chernigov that are blamed on Russia are a result of indiscriminate handouts of weapons, as Russian troops haven’t entered the city.
""There are no Russian troops in Chernigov,"" he said. The incidents ""are most likely a result of thoughtless handouts of weapons in Ukraine to anyone who asks,"" the diplomat said.
Mariupol theater
The Russian air force didn’t consider the Mariupol theater in Ukraine as a target, Nebenzya said.
Nebenzya said Russia’s alleged strike at a theater in Mariupol was one of the fakes that are being spread by Western countries.
""In fact, private persons as early as March 13 released information, which was obtained from Mariupol residents that had miraculously escaped from the city, that the Azov [nationalist battalion] was holding a huge number of people in that building and preparing a bloody provocation,"" he said. ""The Russian armed forces were informed about the situation, and originally the theater building wasn’t designated as a target for an air strike anyway.""
Humanitarian aid
Nebenzya said Russia is creating conditions for humanitarian assistance in the liberated areas of Ukraine.
""We are creating all necessary conditions in the liberated territories for unhindered access by all to humanitarian aid, which in some places is effectively the only chance to survive,"" he said at the UN Security Council meeting. ""At the same time, the mayors of Ukrainian cities sell the medicines, clothing and food coming from international organizations, in particular from the International Committee of the Red Cross, to local entrepreneurs.""
Russia ""has reliably established such facts"" in the cities of Zhytomir, Ivano-Frankovsk, Vinnitsa, Rovno, Lutsk, Dubna, Vladimir-Volynsky and Lvov, he said.
Western weapons
The US and the rest of the West are exacerbating the conflict in Ukraine by shipping more weapons to the country, Nebenzya said.
He said that ""almost every day we see reports from Western capitals about new shipments of various weapons to Kiev.""
""As recently as yesterday Washington said it would supply Ukraine with defense assistance worth $1 billion as soon as this week,"" Nebenzya said. ""You are adding gasoline to the conflict.""
""We state with regret that Ukraine continues to remain a pawn in a geopolitical struggle with Russia,"" the diplomat went on to say.
UN resolution
Nebenzya said the resolution on Ukraine that Western countries plan to propose at the UN General Assembly would be useless for humanitarian efforts.
""In order to obtain an anti-Russian product, they [Western countries] are ready to propose it to the General Assembly, rather than the Security Council, ignoring the fact that the document wouldn’t help humanitarian groups,"" he said at a meeting of the UN Security Council.

Russia revokes request to vote on UN resolution about Ukraine on March 18 — envoy -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy,"UNITED NATIONS, March 18. /TASS/. Russia is revoking a request to the UN Security Council to vote on its proposed resolution about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine that was scheduled for March 18, Russia’s UN envoy Vasily Nebenzya said in a speech at the council on Thursday.
""Colleagues from many delegations are reaching out to us and complaining about merciless pressure and arm-twisting by Western partners, including economic blackmail and threats,"" he said. ""The US and Albania circulated a letter where they urge UN member countries not to sponsor our resolution.""
""We understand how difficult it is for these countries to resist this onslaught,""
Nebenzya continued. ""That’s the reason why we have decided not to request a vote on our proposal at this point, but we aren’t withdrawing the draft resolution.""
""Instead, we will request an urgent meeting to discuss the issue of US biolabs in Ukraine, given the new documents that were obtained during the special military operation,"" the diplomat said.
Russia will send a letter with the request to the UAE presidency of the UN Security Council, Nebenzya said.
Head of the Russian Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Forces Igor Kirillov earlier said that a special military operation in Ukraine uncovered a network of more than 30 biolabs that worked under a contract with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an agency within the US Department of Defense.

""I’m sure pressure is being applied on all countries the way it happened before the vote on a resolution at the General Assembly,"" the diplomat said in response to a question following a UN Security Council meeting. ""I received call from representatives of many countries and I will quote one of them.""
Nebenzya said the representative of the country he didn’t identify said that ""upon receiving instructions from his country, he would vote in favor [of the resolution] although he had planned to abstain.""

History of Crimea’s reunification with Russia -  Russia,"MOSCOW, March 18. /TASS/. March 18, 2022 marks eight years since the treaty on the accession of the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol to the Russian Federation was signed.
Crisis of power in Ukraine
In November 2013, a political crisis began in Ukraine, triggered by Kiev’s refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union. Supporters of the Euro-integration course demanded the resignation of the president and the government. The tide of unrest that kicked off in Kiev promptly spilled over to other Ukrainian cities and regions. However, authorities of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, where the Russian-speaking population constitutes the majority, refused to support the opposition. On February 4, 2014 the Presidium of the Supreme Council initiated holding a referendum on the peninsula's status.
On February 22, a government coup propelled to power the supporters of Euromaidan protests. President Viktor Yanukovich was forced to flee the country. The next day, the Ukrainian parliament voted for the cancellation of the law granting Russian the status of a regional language in some regions of the country. Although it did not take effect, the decision sparked mass protests by Russian speakers, first and foremost in the southeast of Ukraine, and also in Crimea.
Protests in Crimea
On February 23, 2014 pro-Russian residents in Crimea, reluctant to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, started their own open-ended protest in front of the autonomy’s legislature to demand Crimea’s separation from Ukraine. On February 26 the supporters of new Ukrainian authorities and pro-Russian residents demanding secession from Ukraine gathered in the main square of the peninsula’s capital Simferopol. The ensuing unrest upset the operation of the Crimean parliament. Clashes left two dead and more than 30 others injured.
On February 27, after the parliament building was retaken by the authorities the legislators sacked the old government and appointed Sergey Aksyonov, the leader of the local movement Russian Unity as Crimea’s new prime minister.
Referendum
Amid continuing unrest in Crimea the local legislature set a date for holding a referendum on Crimea’s status — May 25 of the same year.
On March 1, Aksyonov asked Russian President Vladimir Putin for assistance in maintaining peace and calm in the peninsula. As tensions kept soaring, a decision was made to hold the referendum much earlier, on March 30. On the same day the upper house of Russia’s parliament — the Federation Council — empowered the Russian president to use troops in Ukrainian territory until the social and political situation in that country returned to normal. On March 1 the members of the city legislature in Sevastopol voted for refusal to obey the authorities in Kiev and for supporting Crimea’s referendum on expanding the autonomy’s status.
On March 6 the Crimean parliament asked the Russian president to admit the republic as a constituent territory of the Russian Federation and set March 16 as the referendum date. On the same day the city council of Sevastopol adopted a resolution in favor of participating in the Crimean referendum. The Crimean parliament formed the republic’s own government ministries, and also prosecutor’s office, security service, security department, customs and other agencies independent from the authorities in Kiev.
On March 11 the legislatures of Crimea and Sevastopol voted for a declaration on the independence of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and of the city of Sevastopol.
The two questions put to the electorate in the referendum were:
1. Are you for the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a constituent territory of the Russian Federation?
2. Are you for the restoration of Crimea’s Constitution of 1992 and for Crimea’s status as a region of Ukraine?
Support from more than 50% of those who cast their ballots was declared enough for the approval of either decision. The ballot papers were printed in three languages — Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar. In the end, 96.77% of the voters (1.233 million) in Crimea and 95.6% (262,000 in Sevastopol) backed reunification with Russia. In Crimea, the turnout reached 83.1% and in Sevastopol, 89.5%. The referendum was monitored by a group of 50 observers from 21 countries, including Israel, France and Italy. Most of the UN member-states refused to recognize the plebiscite.
Declaration of Crimea’s independence
The next day, March 17, 2014 the Crimean parliament adopted a resolution to declare Crimea a sovereign state. The same resolution contained a call addressed to Russia with a request for admitting Crimea to the Russian Federation as a new constituent territory enjoying the status of a republic. On March 17 the legislatures of Crimea and Sevastopol were given new names. Crimea’s State Council declared Ukrainian assets located in the peninsula as republican property and ruled that no Ukrainian laws adopted after February 21, 2014 were applicable in Crimea. The Sevastopol city council unanimously voted for the city’s accession to Russia as separate member of the federation — a federal city.
On March 17 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to recognize Crimea as a sovereign and independent state.
Reunification with Russia
On March 18, 2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin, Crimea’s Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov, chairman of Crimea’s State Council Vladimir Konstantinov and chairman of the coordinating council for crating Sevastopol’s life support directorate, Aleksey Chaly, put their signatures to the treaty on the accession of the new territorial entities to the Russian Federation. Ukraine, the United States and the European Union refused to recognize Crimea’s independence and its reunification with Russia.
On March 21 Putin signed into law an act of ratification of the treaty and the constitutional law on the accession of Crimea and Sevastopol to Russia as members of the federation. On the same day Putin signed a decree to form the Crimean Federal District consisting of the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol (on 28 July, 2016 the Crimean district was abolished and the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol made part of Russia’s Southern Federal District).
On April 11, 2014 the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea was adopted. It established Crimea’s three official languages — Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar.
On March 18, the peninsula marks the Day of Crimea’s reunification with Russia.
Crimea’s development as part of Russia
In 2014-2022, key transport, energy and social infrastructure facilities were constructed in Crimea. According to Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development, as of early 2022 a total of 490 out of 980 facilities have been built on the peninsula. Some 526 bln rubles ($4.9 bln) have been allocated for funding the events of the state program up to 2025.
In 2015-2016, an energy bridge to Crimea was built, which consists of several facilities to link the peninsula’s energy system with Russia’s Unified Energy System.
In 2018, the new Crimean Bridge, linking the peninsula with mainland Russia, was opened for cars. In December 2019, the railway passenger service over the bridge was launched, and in June 2020 the bridge was opened for freight trains.
The 19-kilometer Crimean Bridge, the longest one in Russia and Europe, links the Taman Peninsula (Russia’s Krasnodar region) and the Kerch Peninsula (Crimea).
The overall investments in Crimea and Sevastopol in 2014-2022 exceeded 1.37 trl rubles ($13 bln).

Ukrainian bio laboratories received $32 mln of funding from US — Russian Defense Ministry -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy,"MOSCOW, March 17. /TASS/.

Diplomat dismisses 'fringe' idea of expelling Russia from UN -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy,"MOSCOW, March 17. /TASS/. No scenario of expelling Russia from the United Nations will ever be possible, because the UN Security Council will be unable to issue such a recommendation, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a news briefing on Thursday.
""No scenario of stripping Russia of its UN membership is possible by definition. Article 6 of the UN Charter does envisage the possibility of expelling a country from the UN on the basis of the General Assembly’s decision following a recommendation from the UN Security Council. But the Security Council is unlikely to ever give such a recommendation, because the approval of the corresponding resolution requires not only support from nine members, but also consent by the five permanent members possessing the veto right. Russia is a member of this quintet,"" Zakharova said.
She stressed that even amid the soaring anti-Russian propaganda in the West, the idea of expelling Russia from the United Nations ""remains a fringe one."" Zakharova recalled that the Ukrainian side had begun to indulge in such insinuations much earlier than February.
""Washington and its minions following in its footsteps, which have supported the introduction of sanctions against our country, do not constitute even a simple majority in the UN General Assembly, let alone a qualified two-thirds majority. All other members of the world community have confirmed the readiness to have constructive and mutually beneficial relations with our country in defiance of pressure and crude blackmail by the collective West,"" Zakharova said.
She warned that if the United States went ahead with attempts to push through its stance by means of blackmail and direct threats against other UN member-states, the organization would face a stark question whether it would be able to survive in a situation like this. She stressed that the adoption of any decisions by a majority vote achieved by force was characteristic not of the United Nations, but of such alliances as NATO.

Zakharova emphasized that the Ukrainian president’s statement was in line with his reckless and heartless policy towards his own country and people.
In an address to the US Congress on Wednesday, Zelensky called for imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine or providing the country with S-300 missile systems, other air defense systems and warplanes as an alternative.

Russia diplomat castigates West’s silence on Ukrainian atrocities in Donbass -  World,"MOSCOW, March 17. /TASS/. The West is turning a blind eye to Ukraine’s atrocities against civilians in Donbass, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing on Thursday.
""Once again we see sheer apathy from the West. They zealously ignored and remained silent over yet another atrocity by their Ukrainian subordinates. As if nothing had happened. As if there was no mass slaughter of civilians,"" she stressed.
Zakharova spotlighted the March 14 attack on Donetsk, when the Ukrainian military fired a Tochka-U rocket with cluster munition into the city center, killing more than 20 people and wounding 37 others. ""This is a barbaric terrorist act,"" she emphasized, adding that Russia deeply resents the methods that the Ukrainians have resorted to when conducting hostilities.
The diplomatic spokeswoman also highlighted the fact that this type of weaponry was used repeatedly by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Makeyevka. ""Thanks to the coordinated work of the Donetsk People's Republic militia, it was possible to avoid horrific consequences. Fortunately, no one was killed then, but civilians, including children, were injured,"" she noted.

Russia vows to bring Kiev regime to justice for crimes against humanity -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy,"MOSCOW, March 17. /TASS/. Russia will do everything possible to make sure that Kiev regime’s crimes against humanity are not left unpunishable, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday.
""We will resort to all possible measures to make sure that these crimes against humanity are not left unpunishable,"" she told a news briefing.
The Russian diplomat said that the Kiev regime is immediately shifting the blame on Russians for all developments in the city of Mariupol, particularly the explosion at the Drama Theater, accusing the Russian military for an alleged air drop of a bomb on the facility.
""The blame for everything that happened in Mariupol, particularly in the context of the Drama Theater building bombing, the Kiev regime immediately tried to shift on the Russian troops who, allegedly dropped a bomb on the theater building,"" she said.
""This is a bold lie, the Russian Armed Forces are not bombing the cities and everyone is well aware of this, no matter how many video shots NATO compiled and no matter how many fake pictures are currently circulated, the truth will eventually emerge.""
The Russian Defense Ministry announced late of Wednesday that militants of the Azov nationalist battalion blew up the Mariupol theater building, which they previously rigged with explosives. The Defense Ministry also debunked Kiev’s accusations of an airstrike on the theater building, where civilians could have been held hostage.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24 that in response to a request by the heads of the Donbass republics he had made a decision to carry out a special military operation in Ukraine in order to protect people ""who have been suffering from abuse and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years.""
The Russian leader stressed that Moscow had no plans of occupying Ukrainian territories and the operation was aimed at demilitarizing and denazifying Ukraine.
When clarifying the developments unfolding, the Russian Defense Ministry reassured that Russian troops are not targeting Ukrainian cities, but are limited to surgically striking and incapacitating Ukrainian military infrastructure. There are no threats whatsoever to the civilian population.

"Western states deceive their citizens when accuse Russia of inflation, rising prices — MFA -  Business & Economy","MOSCOW, March 17. /TASS/. Western countries are deceiving their own citizens, claiming that Russia is to blame for inflation and rising prices, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a briefing on Thursday.
""Ordinary European citizens are told that in the new realities in which they already have to live - inflation, fuel prices, inconveniences associated with logistics, Russia is to blame for everything,"" the diplomat said.
""They absolutely ignore those methods, sanctions and threats that are applied directly by the governments of Western countries against our country, and the sanctions pressure that led to tectonic shifts in the financial, economic and humanitarian sectors,"" she added.
According to Zakharova, the myth about Russia's guilt will not take root for a long time, since the vast majority of citizens of European countries know who benefits from it and who started it all.
""European taxpayers, voters have yet to assess the destructive actions of the EU leadership, which is not only focusing on the United States but is the transmitter of their will,"" the diplomat stressed.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on February 24 that in response to a request by the heads of the Donbass republics he had made a decision to carry out a special military operation in Ukraine, stressing that Moscow had no plans of occupying Ukrainian territories. Western countries responded to the actions of the Russian authorities by slapping sanctions on physical and legal entities.

"US-run Ukraine project eyed causing harm via unchecked bird flu, food risks, says Russia -  Science & Space","MOSCOW, March 17. /TASS/. An unearthed US project at a veterinary medicine institute in Kharkov assessed conditions under which the transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza might become unmanageable and create risks to food security, Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said on Thursday.
""The US project at the Kharkov Veterinary Medicine Institute studied wild birds as vectors for transmitting highly pathogenic avian influenza. Simultaneously, conditions were assessed under which the transmission processes could get out of control, cause economic damage, and create risks to food security,"" Konashenkov said.
According to him, the Russian Defense Ministry continues to study documents concerning military biological programs that the US and its NATO allies implemented in Ukraine, which were provided by Ukrainian lab personnel. ""Experts from the Russian Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops have examined original documents revealing the details of a secret US-run project at a lab in Ukraine’s Kharkov, which studied ways to transmit diseases to humans through bats. I would like to point out that according to the documents, this systematic research was going on in Kharkov for years under the direct control of US experts,"" the general stressed. He noted that the ministry would release ""new documents about a large amount of human biological material taken from Ukraine to the United Kingdom and other European countries."" ""We will soon release another package of documents received from Ukrainian biolab employees and will also present the results of their expertise,"" the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman concluded.

Press review: Seizure of Russian assets to harm dollar and why is PACE meddling in Moldova -  Press Review,"Izvestia: Moscow, Kiev continue talks on Ukraine’s neutral status
Moscow and Kiev are moving towards a compromise agreement, representatives of the parties said on March 16. Moscow’s priorities include Ukraine’s demilitarization, neutral status and the absence of threats to Russia, while Kiev demands a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and security guarantees, Izvestia writes.
The parties are making no secret of the fact that the negotiation process is not proceeding smoothly. Until recently, it was Ukraine that made public remarks about how the talks are going but now Russia has also started to provide new information, with Ukraine’s neutrality being the focus of its statements. According to experts, when it comes to a neutral status, each country has its own features.
""The neutrality of Austria and Finland is the result of World War II. Switzerland’s neutral status is a centuries-long tradition stemming from the country’s geographical position and the diversity of its population and culture. The neutrality of Sweden is its conscious choice made in the wake of attempts to build a Baltic empire that had led to a complete resource depletion,"" Editor-in-Chief of the RuBaltic.ru analytical website Alexander Nosovich explained.
""Neutrality is not just a word, it’s part of a country’s history. In Austria, the Swiss alternative was actually proposed in the mid-1950s. It includes a refusal to join military blocs, host foreign troops and take part in conflicts,"" Head of the Department for Social and Political Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Europe Vladimir Schweitzer pointed out. ""Austria accepted neutrality voluntarily, though it had held lots of contacts on the matter with the Soviet Union, too. At the same time, the country did not give up participation in other blocs, namely, the European Union. Moreover, when Austria joined the EU in 1995, it introduced a provision into its constitution, saying that Vienna would not shy away from the EU’s actions (including sanctions),"" the expert noted, stressing that each model was different.
 
Media: Kazakhstan seeks to change its political model
Kazakhstan plans to carry out large-scale reforms, particularly changing the form of government, the country’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said in a televised address to the nation. He proposed a comprehensive modernization program that will include a switch from the super-presidential rule to a presidential republic with a strong parliament, Vedomosti writes.
Reforms are long overdue, which is what the January crisis made clear, Director of the Information and Analytical Center for the Study of Social and Political Processes in the Post-Soviet Space Darya Chizhova pointed out. A party system reform is necessary because the field of party politics has not seen any improvement in a long time, while it’s been almost impossible for new parties to pass the current five-percent threshold given the country’s small population.
Although the announced plans may partially democratize Kazakhstan’s system of government, the proposed package of powers won’t radically change the balance between the branches of government, Senior Researcher with the Center for Post-Soviet Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations Stanislav Pritchin emphasized. According to him, the parliament is unlikely to become much stronger and the president’s position will hardly weaken. In Pritchin’s view, the upcoming political changes have nothing to do with the current Ukrainian crisis or Kazakhstan’s relations with Russia. It is an attempt to resolve issues that led to the January crisis and prevent such incidents from resurfacing in the future, the analyst noted.
Kazakh-German University Professor Rustam Burnashev told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that it was extremely hard to figure out to what extent Tokayev’s initiatives were in line with the public’s expectations. ""Society is seriously fragmented and various groups of the population often times have totally different expectations. In addition, Tokayev’s proposals were developed in a short time and it seems that no polls had been conducted,"" the expert stressed.
 
Nezavisimaya Gazeta: Seizure of Russian assets may diminish dollar’s global role
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Wednesday that the United States and the European Union had tumbled into default after refusing to fulfill their obligations to Moscow. The Russian Finance Ministry sent all the necessary payments to Western banks in advance, issuing a warning that if those payments failed to be processed because of sanctions, Russia would pay in rubles. The move to freeze Russia’s assets worth hundreds of billions of dollars will contribute to the reduction of the US dollar’s role in international payments and reserves, said experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
According to media reports, Saudi Arabia has stepped up efforts to consider the possibility of using the yuan instead of the dollar for payments for part of its oil exports to China. India, in turn, is mulling over plans to make the yuan the base currency for creating a mechanism of settlements in national currencies.
""These severe sanctions may serve as a catalyst for reconsidering countries’ attitude to the dollar as the base settlement and savings currency,"" said Head of Analytical Research at Univer Capital Dmitry Alexandrov. ""No specific trends are in sight yet, it will take them at least several months to become clear. The United States’ actions will be decisive, including those related to the reserves of Russia’s Central Bank, concessions to Saudi Arabia and the rate at which interstate procedures to harmonize payment systems and arrange payments, insurance and logistics services are agreed on,"" he added.
""No real-time data on changes in the share of currencies used for international settlements is currently available due to the latest developments. Radical changes are unlikely to take place quickly, particularly because when global economic instability starts to rise, international investors usually prefer to stick to more conservative strategies, abandoning risky patterns,"" said Dmitry Plekhanov, an analyst with the Institute For Complex Strategic Studies.
 
Nezavisimaya Gazeta: PACE meddles in Moldovan-Transnistrian affairs
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe’s (PACE) resolution about Russia’s ""occupation"" of part of Moldova, Transnistria, was initiated by Romanian lawmakers, while Moldova’s delegation did not take part in developing the document. Leader of Moldova’s Social Democratic Party Victor Selin told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that the move to declare Transnistria ""an occupied territory"" was aimed at unfreezing the Transnistrian conflict by dragging Moldova into military activities against Russia.
""Neither the Moldovan people nor parliamentary members asked the Council of Europe to raise the Transnistria issue, the discussion was initiated by some EU countries. Moldova did not need the decision declaring Transnistria an occupied territory, it’s a provocation,"" Selin emphasized. ""The goal is to accuse Russia of dividing Moldova’s territory, tighten sanctions against Russia or declare a war on it. However, there is an agreement between Russia and Moldova, which says that Moscow recognizes Transnistria as part of Moldova and acts as a guarantor,"" the politician added.
""The West is irked by the fact that Russia has no plans to terminate the agreement (as well as Moldova) and continues to play the role of a peacekeeper in the region. Those who proposed declaring Moldova an ‘occupied’ country in fact seek to unfreeze the Transnistrian conflict by interfering in Moldova’s domestic affairs without its consent,"" Selin pointed out.
""Only effective peacekeeping forces genuinely interested in protecting their families and friends are capable of blocking any attempts to fuel the conflict. Peacekeepers from Transnistria and Moldova, whose children, parents, wives and friends live in the region, are deployed there along with Russian troops,"" Transnistria-based political analyst Andrey Safonov noted. ""There will be no conflict if both parties are free to choose their own development path and refrain from imposing their views on each other,"" the expert added.
 
Izvestia: Russians may get free access to foreign movies, music and games
An initiative to ensure free access to foreign movies, music and computer games for Russians has been sent to Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. The idea belongs to Head of the Public Consumer Initiative organization Oleg Pavlov. He points to a large number of complaints from Russian citizens who had purchased subscriptions at various foreign services that suspended operations in Russia, failing to return money to users. Experts consider the move to be a logical one but warn that it will change the situation with Russian copyrights, too, Izvestia writes.
Deputy head of the A Just Russia - For Truth parliamentary faction Valery Gartung believes that it is too early to refuse to protect foreign copyrights. ""All options need to be weighed up. In my view, it is certainly unfair when Russians are stripped of access to artistic works even though they paid for it. However, I wouldn’t rush to burn bridges,"" he told the newspaper.
""The initiative has positive and negative aspects. It is about developing new rules of the game that actually go beyond international copyright law. I think that it may also have a negative impact on the Russian copyright market because there is a thin line between foreign and Russian copyrights,"" expert with the Film Institute at the Higher School of Economics Oleg Ivanov pointed out.
Copyright expert Igor Murzin does not expect the cabinet to support the initiative officially. ""Mikahil Mishustin probably would like to provide assistance to Russian users but I don’t think that the government will make a decision to stop respecting the copyrights of foreign companies because it may lead to international lawsuits against those broadcasting this content,"" the lawyer explained.

"Medvedev: Cornering us won’t work, Russia strong enough to put brazen foes in their place -  Russian Politics & Diplomacy","MOSCOW, March 17. /TASS/. Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev dedicated his first post on Telegram to the West’s unprecedented pressure on Russia.
""The West’s flagrant hatred of Russia will apparently never hit rock bottom. NATO’s expansion towards our borders, an all-out economic and information war against our country, non-stop threats and intimidation attempts and the fierce persecution of our citizens overseas are the reason for the extreme rise in international tensions that the world is going through,"" the Russian Security Council’s deputy chairman wrote. He lashed out at Western nations’ behavior towards Russia saying it was ""disgusting, nefarious and immoral"" in recent years.
According to Medvedev, the collective West ""did not care about Russia becoming a strong power again, capable of ensuring its interests and protecting its citizens abroad."" ""They have an urgent need to corner our country, bring it to its knees and reform it based on the Anglo-Saxon world’s blueprints, to make it weak and obedient, or better yet, to tear it to pieces,"" Medvedev pointed out when speaking about the West’s intentions. ""It won’t work. Russia is strong enough to put all of its brazen enemies in their place,"" he added.
""We genuinely sought good relations with them. We defeated Nazism together in the 20th century and agreed on universal rules of security and cooperation. But now, the West’s double standards should not surprise anyone. They turn a blind eye to everything they don’t want to see, including the extermination of civilians in Donbass, which has lasted for years. If anything fails to go according to their plans, our country is the one to blame,"" Medvedev emphasized.
He stressed that Russia would continue to fight for a world order that suited the country and our people, ""free of Nazi thugs, historical lies and genocide."" ""Just like before, we have moral strength and historical truth on our side,"" he stated.

Brazil gives Telegram 24 hours to comply with court order and avoid suspension -  Society & Culture,"RIO-DE-JANEIRO, March 20. /TASS/. Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes is ready to overturn the court’s order to suspend Telegram messenger in the country if its administration comply with the court’s requirements in 24 hours, the Globo TV channel reported on Saturday.
""To date, Telegram has complied with part of the court orders, it is necessary to fulfill them in full in order to reverse the decision to suspend it,"" according to the new decision of de Moraes quoted by the TV channel.
According to Globo, the judge took into account the fact that the administration of the messenger indicated a new address for communication on the issue of suspension, including for receiving court correspondence. The messenger also briefed the court about the measures that have already been taken.
In particular, the court requires Telegram to appoint an official representative in Brazil, to report on measures to counter the spread of disinformation. De Moraes pointed to the need to remove messages containing links to information related to the secrecy of the investigation from the Telegram channel of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The court also ruled that the messenger should remove several channels of pro-government political bloggers accused of spreading false news. The new requirements were submitted to the Telegram administration at 16:44 local time on Saturday (22:44 Moscow time).
Suspension of Telegram in Brazil
On Friday, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ruled to suspend the messenger until March 23 saying it had repeatedly refused to adhere to judicial orders to freeze accounts spreading disinformation or comply with the country's laws. Providers that fail to comply with the decision, as well as users who try to bypass the blocking, face a fine of 100,000 reais ($20,000). In addition, the court ordered Apple and Google to remove Telegram from their mobile app stores.
In January, the Valor Economico newspaper reported that Telegram could be banned in Brazil due to concerns about the spread of disinformation using the app in light of this year's general elections. The publication noted that the former head of the Supreme Electoral Court, Luis Roberto Barroso, unsuccessfully tried several times to contact Pavel Durov's company. Durov himself on Friday apologized on his Telegram channel for communication problems that led to the ban of the messenger in the country, and asked the court to postpone its blocking. The founder of Telegram attributed the incident to a malfunction in the work of e-mail.
Telegram has recently gained popularity among supporters of Bolsonaro, who successfully used social networks and instant messaging apps during the 2018 election campaign. The next general election, in which the citizens of the republic will have to elect the President, deputies and a third of the senators of the federal parliament, as well as state governors, is scheduled for October 2, the second round (if necessary) will be held on October 30.

European states unable to quickly replace Russia as gas supplier - head of OMV -  World,"VIENNA, March 20. /TASS/. European countries are currently unable to quickly replace Russia with another gas supplier, head of the Austrian oil and gas company OMV Alfred Stern said in an interview with the Austrian radio station O-1 on Saturday. He was speaking about the desire of the European Union to diversify gas supplies due to the military operation of Russia in Ukraine.
Stern said that Russia's military operation in Ukraine was a complete surprise for the Austrian oil and gas company, which finances the Russian side by buying gas.
""We're in a difficult position. 80% of Austria's gas supplies come from Russia. We've benefited from this for almost 50 years because it's the cheapest gas,"" Stern said.
""We underestimated the risk that came with Russia,"" he added.
""The reality is that the volumes of gas that now come to Europe from Russia are not so easy to replace today. Massive investments are needed to replace gas imports in Europe,"" Stern said.
However, the head of OMV said that in the long term, it will be possible to replace Russia with other suppliers. According to him, OMV's gas contract with Russia is valid until 2040, but the company may consider the legal possibility of withdrawing from this agreement earlier.
""We are now working to ensure the security of supply. What consequences may be further will become clear in the coming months,"" Stern said.
""The pressure on the gas market will continue to be tense,"" Stern said, referring to the high cost of gas in Europe.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on February 24 that in response to a request by the heads of the Donbass republics he had made a decision to carry out a special military operation in Ukraine, stressing that Moscow had no plans of occupying Ukrainian territories.

""Because it happened this way today and tomorrow someone else may fall out of favor. They [the United States] are sending their diplomats all around the world instructing them to demand withdrawal from cooperation with Russia and threatening with sanctions otherwise. They do it not only in small countries, but they also direct such ultimatums and demands to China, India, Egypt, Turkey - it looks like our American colleagues have lost the feeling of reality or are swelling with the ‘super-superiority complex,"" he said.

Ukrainian crisis marks culmination of West’s policy towards Russia - Lavrov -  Russia,"MOSCOW, March 19. /TASS/. The Ukrainian crisis was caused by the policy that the West adopted after it had realized that Russia ""won’t be obedient,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at the international track of the Leaders of Russia Contest on Saturday.
""It’s not about Ukraine. It is the culmination of the policy that the West adopted in the early 1990s after it had realized that Russia would not be obedient as it has an opinion. It’s not because we seek to bully others all the time but because we have our own history, traditions and understanding of our people’s history, as well as our own vision of how to ensure our security and interests in the world,"" he pointed out.
According to Lavrov, once Western countries realized it, they started trying to slow down Russia’s development. ""It’s a shame because when President Putin took office in the early 2000s, we were open to the West, we were ready to cooperate in various forms, including what the president described as relations close to those of an alliance. Unfortunately, it didn’t work,"" the Russian top diplomat noted.
He added that attempts to build relations between Russia and NATO had also failed. ""We repeatedly suggested making equal agreements and ensuring security based on the belief that no one should strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others,"" Lavrov said.

Referendum in Crimea
US former Secretary of State suggested back in 2014 another referendum be organized in Crimea to verify the voting for the West, Lavrov said.
""I will tell you a secret. I hope the then US secretary of state will take no offense. John Kerry said in April 2014 after the Crimean referendum: we understand that is was a fair voting but you organized it too swiftly, announced and held in in a week,"" Lavrov said, adding that Kerry suggested another referendum be organized in Crimea in the summer or autumn of 2014. ""Announce it a couple of months ahead, the result will be the same, but you will be able to invite international observers and they will bless you and verify everything,"" Lavrov recalled Kerry’s proposal. ""You see, it was not about the essence of the matter, which was clear for everyone, but about making a nice picture to say later: yes, they voted and we, Western partners, verified this voting - this is what it was about.""
The Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, a city with a special status on the Crimean Peninsula, where most residents are Russian, refused to recognize the legitimacy of authorities brought to power amid riots during a coup in Ukraine in February 2014.
Crimea and Sevastopol adopted declarations of independence on March 11, 2014.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the reunification treaties on March 18, 2014. The documents were ratified by Russia’s Federal Assembly, or bicameral parliament, on March 21.

Lukashenko says West was pushing Ukraine toward war -  World,"MINSK, March 19. /TASS/. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Saturday said Western countries were pushing the Ukrainian government to start a war.
""The West pushed them toward this war,"" he said in an interview with Japan’s TBS television that was posted on the Belarus-1 YouTube channel.
The Belarusian leader said Kiev imposed sanctions on Belarus even before the West did. ""They closed the opportunity for us to fly over Ukraine, meaning they closed the sky, restricted all flights,"" he said.
Military activities
Military activities in Ukraine would be over quickly if the United States took a position in favor of peace but Washington is unlikely to make such a move, Belarusian President said.
""The war can end very quickly if he (US President Joe Biden - TASS) makes a phone call, if the US takes a position in favor of the establishment of peace on Ukrainian soil. However, he is unlikely to make a call like that. The reason is that the current situation in Ukraine is beneficial for the Americans. This is what America needs,"" Lukashenko pointed out.
According to him, it is either Russia and Ukraine that can end hostilities by signing an agreement or the US, by ordering the Ukrainian authorities to stop military activities. The Belarusian president believes that if Washington takes such a step, the European Union and other countries will support it.
Donbass and Russia
Belarus was ready to deploy border guards to the border between Donbass and Russia but Ukraine rejected the initiative, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said.
""I did everything to prevent war and maintain peace there before a conflict between Ukraine and Russia had broken out. I was even ready to block the border between Donbass and Russia. You know, it’s 400 kilometers long and I was ready to deploy my border guards there and provide other assistance to Ukraine. Russia agreed but Ukraine refused. Why? Because the West was pushing them to launch this war,"" Lukashenko pointed out.
He added that Ukraine had imposed sanctions on Belarus even before Western countries. In particular, Kiev closed the country’s airspace to Belarusian planes.
The economies
The economies of Russia and Belarus are practically indivisible, Lukashenko said.
""Economically, they are practically indivisible systems,"" he said. ""We are so much built in the Russian manufacturing system and Russia in the Belarusian system that a breakup of cooperation ties would cause an economic catastrophe,"" he said.
""Secondly, we have a common market,"" Lukashenko went on to say. ""We ship to Russia probably half of our products. It’s our main market.""
Russia and Belarus, he said, is ""practically one entity in terms of production, economy and a common market for sales."" That also goes for the countries’ militaries as they are a single grouping, the president said.
""We are tied together very tightly,"" Lukashenko said. ""These ties are called a Union State, something that we are trying to build with Russia."".
Zelensky has little control
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has little control over the processes that are underway in the country, Lukashenko said.
""I can only express my own point of view about Volodya Zelensky at the moment. I believe that he has little control over processes in Ukraine,"" Lukashenko pointed out.
""Even before the conflict, he did not seek to delve into these processes due to his level of preparedness of unpreparedness. However, he is not a stupid person and I was hopeful that as he gains experience, <...> he will start to adequately manage the situation in Ukraine. But it did not happen and a conflict broke out,"" the Belarusian president added.
Ukrainian government
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has said Russia has reasons to mistrust the current Ukrainian government.
""In 2014, a ceasefire was reached on the basis of the Minsk accords. Troops were pulled back and how did that end?"" he said. ""That ended in this war. So, Russia has all the reasons to not trust the current Ukrainian government.""
Lukashenko said Russia has set goals for its operation in Ukraine and it will ""definitely achieve them,"" he said.
Belarus remains neutral
Belarus remains neutral in the conflict in Ukraine and will do everything to help put an end to it, Belarusian President said.
""We will do everything to help end this conflict,"" he stated.
""If someone has nothing else to do, they can condemn Russia or Ukraine. As for us, we need to make efforts to end the conflict so that we all can start building warm friendly relations,"" Lukashenko added.
Belarus holds neutrality with respect to the events in Ukraine, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said.
""We are absolutely neutral. We are hosting the talks, and that’s the evidence of our position,"" he said. ""We aren’t going to be pulled into this war. I have said that more than once.""
He said Belarus won’t condemn either Russia or Ukraine.
""We should seek an end to the war and we start to build warm, friendly relations,"" he said.
Cyber weapons
Cyber weapons pose more danger to mankind than nuclear arms, Belarusian President told a Japanese reporter following an interview with Japan’s TBS broadcasting company.
""Nuclear arms won’t be a source of danger in the future as there are more dangerous things than nuclear arms. Those include biological weapons and cyber weapons. They are far more dangerous,"" Lukashenko said, according to a video posted on a Telegram channel close to the Belarusian presidential press service.
According to Lukashenko, ""mankind has not yet realized the danger, particularly the one coming from cyber weapons.""
""We all tremble at the mention of nuclear arms but cyber weapons are scarier,"" the Belarusian president noted, adding that such weapons were difficult to detect, while people ""are not ready yet to fear cybercrime and cyber weapons."".
Russia will be able to complete
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has said Russia will be able to complete its special military operation in Ukraine on its own, and Minsk isn’t being asked to step in.
""No one is asking us to take part in the operation of the Russian military directly,"" he said. ""I spoke about it recently. We are unable to add anything to this Russian operation.""
""They have enough personnel, they have enough equipment, which is the same we have, but even more advanced,"" he went on to say. ""So, Russia will be able to handle this problem without Belarus, without Japan or any other country.""
Lukashenko said Belarus holds neutrality, and cited the fact that the country is hosting talks between Russia and Ukraine as evidence.
Earlier, Mikhail Podolyak, adviser to the Ukrainian president’s head of staff, stated there is currently no threat that Belarus will invade Ukraine.
Ukraine shouldn’t be a foothold for attacking
Lukashenko has said Ukraine shouldn’t be a foothold for attacking Russia.
""Russia is offering Ukraine the same things that are happening in Belarus, meaning Ukraine should become like Belarus, with some nuances"" he said.
Lukashenko said Ukraine shouldn’t possess nuclear weapons, threaten Russia and ban people living in the country from speaking the language they wish because ""there’s a lot of Russians there.""
""If they want to speak Russia, please let them do so,"" he said. ""No one should pressure anyone.""
""By no means should Nazism thrive there [in Ukraine] so it doesn’t evolve into fascism that we lived through in the middle of the last century,"" Lukashenko said.

At the same time, in Volodin’s words, NATO member states continue to supply weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, while mercenaries recruited in NATO countries ""join Ukrainian nationalist battalions."" ""So when [US President Joe] Biden and his NATO colleagues call for peace, they should start with themselves. They are to blame for a delay in efforts to resolve the situation in Ukraine, demilitarize and denazify the country.

""We will wait until the end of March. The lack of response or a negative response would be a basis for our decision,"" he said, without specifying what kind of decision it would be.
According to the official, the space corporation was not going to yield to the sanctions.
Last week, Rogozin said the Russian state-run space corporation Roscosmos was sending appeals to its partners in the International Space Station demanding they lift illegal sanctions from the corporation’s companies.
During an earlier meeting with Russian lawmakers, Rogozin said the work of the International Space Station was no longer effective amid the current geopolitical sitaution.

""We have responsibility to our science, we must do this. <…> We are to begin working on putting the mission to Mars into practice soon,"" Rogozin said.
He doubted that a Mars rover would be necessary for the success of the mission.
""The landing module itself is a scientific station. It will be enough for the mission to succeed. We will simply repeat what we had already done before, but I have great doubts whether they [Europeans] will succeed without us,"" he added.
Rogozin stressed that Russia already has a carrier rocket and a launch facility.
""The Angara rocket is about to complete its flight trials, as stage two of the Vostochny Cosmodrome will be ready soon,"" he said. ""It won’t be hard to recreate the Kazachok landing module, we have all designs at our disposal.""
In his opinion, it will take six years or maybe more for the European Space Agency (ESA) to recreate the landing module for the ExoMars mission.
""Six years are the most optimistic scenario,"" Rogozin added.
Earlier, the ESA said its Governing Board had found it impossible to go ahead with cooperation within the framework of the Russian-European ExoMars mission in the current situation. The ESA said the decision was made unanimously at the Governing Board’s meeting in Paris. Earlier, the ESA said the launch of ExoMars was unlikely due to the anti-Russian sanctions imposed over Ukraine.
In turn, Rogozin said on March 18 that Roscosmos would go ahead with launching a research mission towards Mars in defiance of the European Space Agency’s pullout from the ExoMars project.
